Hi, everyone welcome to our medication for accepting the present moment
Our medication today is going to focus on truly finding acceptance of what you have and where you are in your life
each of Us
[testicles] are working towards an achievement a
Lifestyle or Perhaps simply some of our television aware, how we see your life becoming
And even though all these goals and dreams are wonderful, and they are a great way to start ambitions for ourselves
Sometimes life throws things that has better Beyond our control
Sometimes [you] can have like a lot of breaks
Stopping definite tracks forcing us to overthink and review your progress achievements that far
The beautiful thing about life in this existence
Is that sometimes it's best to people [in] the passenger seat and [he] could be breath and allow things to unfold how they will
And it doesn't mean that we should be working hard and trying [our] best
[but] when all is said and done
There's nothing else you could do
The best thing you can do is let go and go with the flow
This game sometimes only does more harm
to create more struggle [or] frustration with the inability to accept what is
to accept this present moment
You are alive
You're here
Worrying about something you cannot change or do will only attract more negativity into your life
And [that's] faces who wants that?
So with that said let's begin our medication together
First let's find a comfortable spot perhaps on the bed or on the floor
Go ahead in a cross-legged position
feeling your spine along getting
yourself sinking into the ground
begin by closing your eyes and
Just bring all of your awareness to your breath
[maybe] breath into your nose, and then slowly exhaling all the iraq
the breath
And exhale let it go
1yd backing
And as you exhale
visualizing all that negative energy
Releasing out of your body
Mounting away out of your body
Allow yourself to be coming soon with your body
feeling the chest expand and contract
the Bat-Beam
Hey left
Letting go of any tension in the shoulders
Allowing them to drop and release away from the ears
Begin to feel the sensations of peace and relaxation overcome your body
breathing [in]
And picking a long deep exhale
Your time your time out [to] be with yourself
[be] wrapping exhale
Feel the heart beating in your chest
[you] are pete
Beautiful organ bringing your life giving you energy
Allow you to have the life that you have
the tracking and exhale out
If you start to feel your body become more and more relaxed
Like you slowly introduce [our] Mantra
Repeating the silently in your mind
Simply using it to come back to whenever your mind starts to [wander]
[I] release control I surrender to the [flow]
[I] release control I surrendered to the flow
[I] release control
I surrender to the flow
And now [silent] in your mind until you hear my voice again telling you to come out of your medication
[and]
[and]
[ok]
[yeah]
[yeah]
[yeah]
[yeah], [yeah]
Time to release Mantra
slowly bringing your awareness back to your breath
Take me be dressing
and a long exhale
slowly begin to feel the body moving each finger
feeling the energy
Running through your whole entire system
re-energized rebalance peaceful
Feel free to stay at the state as long as you like and whenever you're ready slowly open your eyes
[you] go on with your day today. I'd like you to remember this Mantra
Whenever you feel like there's too much stress in your body in your mind where things are just getting out of your control
Let it be there's nothing you can do what you've done everything that you can
Let go
and go with the flow
Thank you so much for joining me today. [I] hope you enjoyed this medication
I wish [you] [a] beautiful day from of happiness peace and love
[yeah]
[yeah]
