welcome to your meditation for letting go of anxiety
starting by sitting up right in a comfortable postion
inhale reaching your arms up to the sky
exhale hands down to your knees
you may lean against a wall
or sit up right
whatever is comfortable for you
relax your shoulders
elongate your spine
and begin to take a couple of deep breaths
to release any tension
you may be feeling right now
deep breath in
and exhale let it all go
focus your attention
on your breath
feeling the coolness of the inhale
and the warmth coming out of your nostrils
bring yourself into the present moment
right now
wherever you are
lets begin to feel the tension
slowly leave you body
drawing the breath
and direct it upwards
to the heart palate at the roof of your mouth
begin to now deepen your breath
and move the breath
up to the centre of your
scull where the third eye chakra
is located
just behind the eyebrows
allowing the breath
to now flow through the forehead
through the space between the eyebrows
begin to feel the energy channel
of your own body
as you continue to breath
though the forehead
begin to feel your awareness
moving inward
its very normal to have thoughts
arise
and if that happens let them come in
don't pay any attention to them
see them as clouds
flwoing through
and allow them to pass
as you make a choice
to not get involved with them
stay in the place where the mind becomes indrawn
continue to focus on your breath
flowing into your nostrils
though the centre of the skull
and in between the eyebrows
feeling a state of piece
and calm that is
filling your body
settling into the inner state of silnce
feeling warm positive energy
flowing through each cell
of your being
filling you with love
peace
calm contetment
and happiness
you are exactly where you need to be
in your life right now
everything that you have
is exactly what you need
and everything that you know
is exactly what you need to know
at this very moment
any obstacle or challenge
that you are going through right now
whatever you are going through right now is here with a purpose
to make your stronger
more powerful
and prepare you
for the greatness
thats to come into your life
continuing to breathe
stay within your being
let go
of all those fears that no longer serve you
begin to visualize the wonderful opportunities
that are coming into your life
through the practice of love
and manifestation
feeling the sense of calm
and relaxation
that is upon you
continuing to take deep breaths
as you feel that negative energey
leaving your body
and as you bring in positive energy
into your body
whenever you're ready you may slowly begin to open your eyes
and moving your fingers gently
and then taking a deep breath in
and reaching your arms up to the sky
gather all that positive energy
all the energy that you need
to help yourself get through
whatever your going through right now
and bring that energy into your heart
and feel your being
with this positive loving energy
thank you guys for joining me
i wish you love
prosperity
and happiness
