welcome to our guided meditation day 7
I'm very proud that you've decided join me today
on our guided meditation for inner strength
the focus of the meditations today
is to help you find the positive
powerful energy
that lies within you
to help you deal with any stress
painful circumstances
or just to start your day rejuvinated
i believe each of us
is stronger than we really think
life is a beautiful journey
that is not always easy
but i truly believe that the universe
the ddevine power
sometimes puts difficult situations
in order to help us grow
understand ourselves
and find the strength
to build us into more stronger confident
powerful souls
you and i, we together at some point
in our lives have been challenged
hurt betrayed
beaten or discouragged
but in the end nothing has defeated you
you are not a victim
you may have been delayed but not
denyed
the person or situation that hurt you
is weaker than you because you're still here
so don't let an expereince
weaken you let it
build you
and make you stronger than you were before
our job is to find the positive even in the most
its the only way we will in
when we stop feeling sorry for ourselves we start feeling stronger
lofe changes every single day
and so can you
you can have the new beginning you want
whenever you want because life always
begins now
not tomorrow or the next day but now
with that said
lets begin our meditation
coming into a comfortable seated position
with feet crossed in front
hands rested on your knees

or your hands open
in order into being open in receiving
powerful energy into your energetic field
as you find your comfortable position
begin to close your eyes
bring attention to the space between your eyebrows

allowing yourself to sink a little deeper
into a relaxed meditative state

allow the feeling of relaxation to take over
as you let go
let go of any worries

or to do lists
and dedicate this time to yourself

before i let you go deeper into your meditation
lets introduce our entering thought
our mantra for today
use this mantra through your meditation to help you focus
remind yourself of what you are manifesting through yourthoughts
repeating this mantra
strength surrounds me
love guides me
peace fulfills me
and now silently in your mind
its time to release your mantra
begin to bring your attention back to your breath
taking deep inhale in
long exhale out
bring attention back to your body
starting to move each finger
and each toe
letting your body know its time to wake up
and face the day
and face the day
thank you so much for joining me on meditation for inner strength
before you go on with your day
i want to remember to smile
even when its tough
smile
smiling doesn't always mean your happy
and you are
love and light to you all
