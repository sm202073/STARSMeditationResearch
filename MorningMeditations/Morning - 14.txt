welcome to your morning meditation to
start your day
let's begin today finding a comfortable
seated position
seated on your mat on the ground or
perhaps even on your bed
close your eyes and rest your hands in
your lap or on top of your knees
just take this opportunity right now to
settle in
settling in your body
in your own being
with your eyes closed allowing any
tension
to slowly release out of your body
inhale
and exhale just let it all go
with your next inhalation pay attention
to all the sensations in your body
pay attention to the temperature
the texture of air coming in through
your nostrils as you take your deep
breath in
the sensation of this air leaving your
nostrils
as you breathe out
notice the coolness and the heat of your
breath
notice the sound
the vibration within your body
[Music]
allow yourself to find grounding
stillness and peace within yourself
this is the beginning the first moments
of your day
may they be filled with bliss joy and
happiness
as you allow yourself to go inward
tuning out all external distractions
anything that may pull you away
and simply focusing and simply being
one with yourself
not thinking about your day
not thinking about what you may have to
do in the next half an hour
40 minutes to an hour
simply focus on the inhale
and the exhale
as we welcome this beautiful day
let us remember that we hold the keys
to allow it to unfold in every way that
we wish
remembering that even though we may not
control
what life brings our way today what we
do have control over
is how we respond to it
so as we connect deeper into our own
being into our own soul
may we connect deeper with the true
essence of who we are
which is love
may this energy guide us forward today
allow us to make decisions and choices
from the center of our being from the
center
with love
inhale
and exhale just let it all go
allow yourself to feel light
feeling any heaviness tension
negative energy melting
out and away from your body
surrender it and release it out of your
energetic field
and with your inhalation
begin to visualize yourself welcoming
beautiful
radiant light into your body
a light of love
peace compassion
and joy
inhale and
exhale
as we begin to go deeper and deeper into
this
state of stillness
let us bring our attention to our breath
to our mind
as different thoughts and ideas come
through your mind
let us find a neutral place without any
judgment
do not try to quiet your mind completely
if the thoughts come let them come
simply don't attach yourself to them
just be the witness of your thoughts
stay present with your own breath
your own awareness within your own
stillness
as you stay in this blissful state of
being
feel free to visualize your day
unfolding in the most
perfect way
what is it that you wish to achieve
today
what is it that you wish to gift
yourself or to others today
simply watch your day unfold
as if you're watching a crystal ball
letting it unfold in the most beautiful
divine
perfect way
breathe in
and exhale and just stay here
be one with yourself
as you let go and go with it
[Music]
[Music]
so
foreign
begin to slowly bring awareness
back to your breath
coming back to that sensation of the
inhalation
and exhalation
bringing awareness to your body
noticing how your own heart
feels in this moment
just breathe in and let go
and as you close off your meditation
practice
remember that this beautiful peaceful
energy
is always here for you
no matter where your day ends up going
to today
you can always close your eyes and come
back to yourself
whenever you need to
