[Music]
as you come
and settle into your comfortable
position
seated on the floor your bed or wherever
else you feel comfortable today
take this opportunity to connect deeper
to your breath
inhaling gently
exhaling slowly
close your eyes
[Music]
and feel the sensation of stillness
easiness and love begin to overcome your
body
guiding you to let go deeper and deeper
into this moment
big breath in
big breath out
connect to your heart
[Music]
and thank yourself for finding this time
in your busy day today
and dedicating it to your health and to
your well-being
and if you're joining me today as part
of the boho beautiful 14-day mindfulness
journey
welcome to day 10.
give yourself permission to let go
deeper
feeling the heaviness of your body begin
to melt into the ground
allowing yourself to be supported to be
held by the floor underneath you
let go breathe in
and breathe out
go within
[Music]
as you allow yourself to go deeper
remember that each day is gifted to you
with the intention
and purpose of giving you the
opportunity to mold it into whatever you
wish
and you feel you deserve
just like a painter with a fresh blank
canvas in front of them
you hold the power to create all that
you desire
out of nothing you hold the power
to welcome each day with the strength
from within
with courage and patience
and the understanding that your
perception creates your reality
so it's time to release all fears and
limiting beliefs of who you are
with love and grace now is the time to
release and let go of
all this past conditioning self-doubt
and insecurity
my new day is here
so breathe in and let it all go
choose now to step forward with courage
step forward in pure presence in pure
awareness of your power
your strength and your unlimited
potential
breathe in and feel your breath this
powerful energy
entering your body
[Music]
let it fill you up and guide you forward
with strength
stay in this awareness in this presence
in this loving stillness
[Music]
breathing in and letting go
allow yourself to go deeper within
using the following mantra whenever you
find yourself begin to be pulled away by
the mind
with love and grace i step
forward with courage
with love and grace i step
forward with courage
[Music]
now silently in your mind as you let go
and go within

it's time to slowly begin to return to
your breath
deepening the inhalation
elongating the exhalation
[Music]
feel free to slowly release the mantra
and continue to stay in this beautiful
powerful present awareness
