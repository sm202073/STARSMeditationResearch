taking this moment to
find a comfortable place
seated grounded disconnected from all
external noise
letting yourself go within
[Music]
thank you for being here with me
thank you for showing up for yourself
today
if you're joining me as part of the 14
day boho beautiful mindfulness journey
welcome to day five
let us take this opportunity to find
peaceful presence from within
drawing our awareness inward as we close
our eyes
and simply focus on the inhalation
and exhalation
breathe in
breathe out
setting an intention to breathe in life
force energy
source energy
to activate this energy in our heart
bringing forth our hearts desire
knowing that we are worthy to receive
worthy to live a beautiful life that is
guided through love
peace and gratitude
so breathe in
and let it go
as you allow yourself to settle in
deeper
and deeper
feel your heart
the sensations of your breath
the coolness of the air coming
into your body as you inhale
[Music]
and the warm sensation of the air
leaving your body as you exhale
allow this breath to ground you
support you
[Music]
fill you up with all the powerful energy
that lives
inside of you
guiding you into a closer connection
with your limitless potential
reminding you that in this vast universe
filled with miracles and beauty
your potential is truly limitless
that you are capable of creating a life
that you know you truly deserve
so breathe in
and as you breathe out ask yourself
what does your heart long for
what is it that you wish to achieve
to become
look into your heart and inquire
dig deep and look inside
your potential is limitless
take another breath in
and as you exhale let yourself sink
deeper
into stillness
let go into stillness
surrender into stillness
and as you go deeper into this beautiful
silence
keep your present awareness on the
breath
repeating the following mantra whenever
you catch your mind be drawn away
by thoughts or emotions
my potential and power is limitless
my potential and power
is limitless
now silently in your mind
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's time to release your mantra
coming back to your breath to your heart
breathing in deeply
and letting go
stay in the silent awareness
feeling the pulsating energy of power
and strength
vibrating through each cell of your
being
stay here as long as you need before
slowly
and gently opening your eyes
thank you so much for joining me today
for our beautiful meditation together
from my heart to yours with love
and gratitude namaste
