[Music]
take a moment
to find and settle into a comfortable
seated position
[Music]
your spine upright eyes closed
begin to deepen your internal connection
by focusing on your breath
[Music]
inhale and
exhale
finding stillness
peace and grounding
as you give yourself permission to go
deeper within
inhale
[Music]
and a long exhale out
thank yourself for showing up today for
your well-being
and if you're joining me today as part
of the beau beautiful
14-day mindfulness journey welcome to
day eight
give yourself the opportunity at this
time to fully and completely
let go let go of tension in your face
relax your jaw
your shoulders
allow your heart to let go
let go of your body and allow yourself
to be still
surrender
there is something magical that happens
within us when we truly commit
to letting go and surrendering to the
process of life
just like water letting the energy move
letting things unfold the way they will
through embracing the fluidity of life
we give ourselves the permission to
release control
[Music]
let go it's okay
just breathe deeply
breathe it in and breathe out as you let
[Music]
go
remember that you are guided
you are protected
you are loved
open yourself to the magic of
surrendering to the flow of life
feel the energy within your fingertips
breathe it all in
[Music]
and let it all go
when we surrender we let go of the
resistance
[Music]
opening ourselves to trust
trusting our hearts our intuition
to trust the divine universe that it is
guiding us forward in every single way
[Music]
with each breath trust the unfolding of
your life
breathe in
[Music]
and let it go
[Music]
feeling yourself connected bring more
oxygen
into your body
and then release into stillness
into peace into love
[Music]
as you go deeper within let us introduce
our mantra for today
that will be here for you to repeat and
come back to
whenever you feel your mind and thoughts
drift and pull you away from this
peaceful
present awareness
i surrender to the flow and unfolding
of my life i surrender
to the flow and unfolding
of my life
[Music]
and now silently in your mind as you
allow yourself to go deeper
and deeper within
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]

[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
huh
[Music]
so
[Music]
slowly and gently release the mantra
[Music]
begin to return to your breath
inhaling and exhaling softly
reconnect to the beating of your heart
as you slowly begin to bring awareness
back to your body
gently opening your eyes whenever you're
ready
to come out of this meditation
thank you so much for joining me today
from my heart to yours with all my love
and gratitude namaste
