find a comfortable seated position
and begin with a nice long slow deep breath [Music]
close your eyes and Center in Where You Are
[Music] just allow the breath the bridge between your inner world and outer world to help you
tune into and breathe into what's present now [Music]
Our intention is nothing more than being in this moment consciously aware of our breathing
nothing to do other than breathe
[Music] breathing and slowly and deeply [Music] breathing out
fully arrive bringing all your energy and attention and presence into this moment breathing
and settling into your inner landscape [Music]
notice the rise and fall of your belly with each breath
foreign
of your breath as it enters and exits your nostrils
notice the sensations of your skin where skin touches air [Music] where skin meets your
clothes or the floor [Music]
notice any sounds inside the room that you're in or further away
and just invite them all to be part of this experience
[Music] drift your awareness to your whole body
and scan for any Sensations that are present [Music] maybe areas of tension or contraction
[Music] or maybe areas where your body feels relaxed and energized and open
[Music] observe how your body is in this moment
become aware of the weight of your body and how gravity allows you to rest Softly on the
Earth
another thing that you have a body
and as You observe also being aware that you're more than a body
breathing in
and slowly exhaling letting go foreign
[Music]
your awareness to your emotions notice how you're feeling right now
[Music]
maybe there's a sense of curiosity [Music] sadness or agitation or joy
foreign [Music] notice what's present within you right now in this moment
[Music]
don't try to change anything just allow whatever's there to be there
as you continue to note us and breathe and hold space for all that's within you
[Music]
[Music] will take another deep breath in
and exhale completely
foreign
ERS to your thoughts
notice the quality of your thoughts
does your mind feel busy or quiet
just create space for the inevitable thoughts to arise and pass by
imagine your mind is like the vast Blue Sky
thoughts are like clouds passing by
watch them come and watch them go
without getting attached without getting caught up in stories
without making meaning or beating yourself up just gently drift your awareness back to
your breath [Music] how does your mind feel [Music]
breathing in deeply and recognizing yes I have a mind of thoughts and a body
but who I am is more than thoughts more than my body
what is even deeper
[Music]
become aware of the part of you that's noticing
who was the one who was noticing your body your thoughts and your emotions [Music]
you begin to realize that
you are the one who is observing
you're not the part that you're observing
you're not the contents of your Consciousness which are always changing
hear this loving Observer
Soul
able to hold all parts of you
pain the grief [Music] the love the bless the Beauty and the longing
everything
[Music] tune into this inner Observer [Music]
your true self
[Music] and ask this Observer what would I truly love [Music] what do I desire what do
I want what do I need and how do I wish to feel [Music]
take a moment to tune into that [Music]
foreign [Music]
as you breathe fully embody these longings and desires [Music] imagine yourself feeling
the way you wish to feel
now
maybe a sense of ease peace
bless Joy
forgiveness compassion
love kindness [Music] appreciation
[Music] just let waves of grace
fall over you as you fully embody [Music] desired feelings now
[Music] foreign [Music]
keeping your eyes closed begin to bring your attention back to your body
[Music] back to the room that you're in [Music]
slowly begin to bring some movement to your fingers and toes [Music] and taking all the
time that you need when you're ready and only when you're ready you can open your eyes
[Music]
