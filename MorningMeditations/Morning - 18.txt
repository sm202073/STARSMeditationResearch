hey guys
welcome to your guided meditation for beginners
beginning meditation today by finding a comfortable position
sitting crossed legged or against wall
placing hands on our knees
the palms of your hands pointed upward or downward
closing your eyes
and simply begin to witness your breath
feeling the inhale coming through the nostrils
and exhale out
letting go of all the tension
beging to observe the movement of your breath
without trying to control it
if your breathe begins to change
becoming slower of faster
allow these changes to happen without
any resistance
or anticipations
completely surrender yourself to your breath
deep inhale into your nose
long exhale out
feeling your body expand as you inhale
belly rises
as you exhale chest contracts belly lowers
as you're staying there with your breathe begin to feel the coolness of your breath\
as it travels through your nostrils
and the warmth of the air as it travels out of your nostrils
deep breath in
filling those lungs with as much oxygen as you can
exhale completely letting go
as you're sitting here in your comfortable position
its very normal for our minds to wonder
if your attention drifts away to particular
thought in your mind
or perhaps a sound in the environment
or a sensation in your body
gently bring your awareness back to your breath
focus on the inhale and exhale
remember distractions are completely normal
especially in the first stages of your meditation journey
remember to be patient with yourself
be patient with your mind
just as anything physical
meditation takes regular practice
through meditation we learn the practice of patience
patience with our mind
patience with our body
and this practice of patience will transfer to your everyday life
stay wit your beathe
inhale in exhale out
if your mind wonders come back to the sensation of the coolness of the inhale
and the warmth travelling out as you exhale
begin to feel the heart beating in your chest
the source of life
feel your lungs expand and contact
your breath is what is keeping you alive
keeping you going
focus on simply that
with each inhale allow yourself to feel more relaxed
more at ease
and more comfortable
inhale and exhale
stay with your breath
you have nothing else to worry about
you deserve to take this 10 minutes
to connect with your body
connect with your mind
connect with your spirit
as your sitting there with your eyes closed
begin to notice if you start to see any colours

or shaps in front of your
every person is different in what they see
or some may not see anything at all
just except what it
is
allow yourself to notice but not pay too much attention
simply allow things to come to you
focus on simply breathing in
and out
continuing to breath
brining your mind back to your breath
not allowing frustration
to overtake you
you are exactly where u need to be
in this practice right now
inhale
and exhale
now slowly begin to bring awareness back to your body
you may begin to add movement to your fingers
and slowly opening your eyes
inhale exhale
just take a moment for yourself
and reach your arms up
and over your head
and give your body a nice stretch
bring your palms of your hands together
and bring them down to your heart
gently bow your head down
and towards your heart
and thank yourself
for giving your being. your mind, your body and spirit
a time to connect
and a take to meditate
thank you so much for joining me
and remember continue to practice
continue to take the time each day to meditate
reconnect
and love
thank you hope to see you soon again
