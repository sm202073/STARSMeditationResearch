[Music]
this is a brief
guided mindfulness meditation
on living each day
as i often suggest
in these sessions
find a comfortable position
to sit or lay
[Music]
keeping alert and present
just focusing on the sound of my voice
[Music]
and taking gentle
natural breaths
focusing on that airflow
in
and out
how are you
are you tired
stressed
relaxed
anxious
whatever you feel right now
it is okay
allow yourself to feel it
and
not run from it
just settle in
and continue
those natural
comfortable breaths
keep that focus on the sound of my voice
and continue to allow yourself
to give in
to the present moment
right now
you have no regrets about the past
and no worries about the future
[Music]
just right here
right now
hearing the words i am sharing with you
breathing in
and out
present
mindful
relaxed
what does it mean to say
live each day
i think it means to open your heart and
mind
to the possibility of each day
every time you wake up
and catching yourself at various moments
throughout each day
when you stray away
from that peace and joy within the
present moment
allowing your minds to
fight through
the daily distractions
there will be times in our lives
where there will be difficulties and
challenges
of course
and living each day
does not mean that you must force
yourself to feel a certain way
you can and may be sad about a loss
or about something larger going on in
the world
[Music]
but the process of living each day
[Music]
means to seek something deeper
a calm
stillness
deep
within you
[Music]
like a comforting home
that you can seek out
once you weather each storm
we can't always avoid
sadness
or pain or loss
or problems
but you can make the conscious choice
to keep that place of peace within you
always there
underneath
and you can leave the door open
to embrace it
a place
of stillness and peace
always there
deep within you
[Music]
with this in mind
we will do a short series of affirmation
statements
followed by
the calming ambient music for a while
longer
i invite you to
repeat these phrases
either in your head
or say them out loud if you wish
[Music]
we will begin
now
[Music]
i have strength
in mind
and body
i start each day
with positivity
i will find
a deep sense of peace
within me
[Music]
i
will keep a level head
through any challenges
[Music]
i will be mindful in each moment
i
will live each day
[Music]
present
peaceful
and aware
that's fantastic
so now
i'll say each one of these
ideas once more
but shorter now
just to reinforce each one
and again
feel free to follow along with me
starting with
strength in mind and body
[Music]
positivity
peace within
a level head
[Music]
mindful in each moment
living each day
[Music]
present
peaceful
aware
[Music]
wonderful
job let the ambient sound continue
and as you do
you may wish to
think of a favorite
memory from your past
a favorite
vacation destination
maybe one you've been to or
one you haven't
some beautiful part of nature just
something that brings you great
joy and peace
a best friend a pet
a loved one
just
use this
as an added point of focus to
live with presence
to live each day
[Music]
as you hear the ambient sound
allow
this message of living each day
to permeate deep within you
use your chosen thought
to feel that sense of peace that will
allow you to weather the stormy times in
life
and you will make your way through
with a strong mind
thoughtful and aware
growing
learning
and moving forward
day by day
