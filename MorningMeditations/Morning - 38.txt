as we begin our practice today
take a moment to check in with yourself
check in with your breath
your body your heart
how are you feeling
[Music]
check in and see where you may be
holding on to tension in this very
moment
bring your awareness to this part of
your body
or perhaps your heart or your mind
and then consciously breathe this
tension out
breathe it out
[Music]
close your eyes let yourself become
heavier
more relaxed
feeling yourself supported
held by the ground by the earth
let go
breathe in
and breathe it out
thank yourself for showing up for your
well-being today
[Music]
and if you're joining me as part of the
boho beautiful 14 day mindfulness
journey
welcome to day nine
it's time to give yourself permission to
be still
to be present
to become one with your breath
[Music]
in and out
feeling your face letting go of any
physical tension
let it relax
let your eyes be heavy
your jaw super loose
let your shoulders drop towards the
earth
and let your heart open up to the
presence
of love and peace all around you
breathe in and let
it go
[Laughter]
[Music]
feel the stillness the presence of your
being
[Music]
in a world that is filled with so much
darkness
may you be the shining light of hope
[Music]
the light of peace of love
of truth and compassion
may you find your strength and power
from within
and let it shine your way
[Music]
it is time to go beyond the pains and
wounds of this world
and return to the infinite power that
lives within you
return to your inner peace
to the light of your soul's essence
so take a deep breath in
breathe into your center feel it now
feel the light
feel it with every cell of your body
[Music]
this is the true core of your being
[Music]
reconnect with that divine light within
you
and never forget that you are sacred
that you are divine
that you are love and you are light
so breathe in
and breathe out
[Music]
allow yourself to sit still in this
beautiful present
awareness of love visualize it
see this light entering your being
healing every part of you that is in
need of healing in this very moment
breathe it in
and breathe it out
open yourself to love and allow this
beautiful light
to guide you forward
stay in the stillness this presence
stay with the awareness of your breath
your heart
guiding this beautiful energy to heal
you
to protect you and to guide you forward
through this life
stay here
[Music]
feel your breath your heart
if you begin to feel your mind become
distracted by
thoughts use the following mantra
to help you return to yourself whenever
you need to
i am love i am light
i am love i am light
[Music]
and now silently in your mind as you let
go
and go within
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
breathe it in
[Music]
let it go
it's time to release the mantra
beginning to slowly return to yourself
to your breath
to your body
to your heart
[Music]
bring gratitude to your heart for this
opportunity
to reconnect and be guided by your
divine inner light
breathe in
breathe out

need
opening your eyes gently and slowly
whenever you are ready to finish this
