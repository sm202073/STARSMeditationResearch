Take this time to center yourself,
become present,
and deepen the connection between mind and body.
You can build a fire of motivation and energy.
You can spread goodness and positivity.
You are full of possibility.
Just become aware of your natural breathing.
You can use this as your anchor.
Just as with your heartbeat,
these are our reminders
of the continual flow of life.
Through this, we can recognize
that there will always be a past --
always be a future.
But as of right now,
this moment,
you are hearing my voice
and staying present wherever you are.
Right now there is only here and now.
And you can embrace this and enjoy this.
And as you do so,
you can also recognize and embrace
that sense of positivity.
A feeling of forward momentum.
To help with this, I will  count down from five to one,
and will give some short phrases.
These are reminders that you  can use throughout each day.
So feel free to repeat after me
either out loud or in your head,
Starting now:
Five:
"Embracing the energy of life."
Four:
"Enjoying this moment."
Three:
"Finding the energy within me."
Two:
"Being a positive force."
One:
"Out into the world."
And just once more, I will repeat
"Being a positive force
out into the world."
Wonderful.
Deeply feel this simple yet  powerful message within you.
Your body and mind acting as one.
Right now, take just a  minute of comfortable silence
to reflect on these ideas
and feel them everywhere.
Not in just your mind but  throughout your entire body,
and even in the aura around you.
Peace, positivity, energy, love.
Reflect on this
now.
Great.
And now, if you like,
just allow a deep rejuvenating breath or two.
Just deeply in,
and out,
and in,
and out.
You can do more at your own pace if you like.
And when you like,
return once again to that  calming and relaxing state
of presence and natural breath.
And as you are feeling so at peace
yet motivated
for whatever next steps are ahead of you,
we will embrace that energy,
embrace that forward momentum,
and we'll count once more.
First with our phrases,
and then, as we ready ourselves  to finish this session,
just with numbers.
Reflecting and feeling this again,
deeply within and around us.
Starting now.
Five:
"Embracing the energy of life."
Four:
"Enjoying this moment."
Three:
"Finding the energy within me."
Two:
"Being a positive force."
One:
"Out into the world."
Keep this forward momentum,
spread it by means of your centeredness,
your calm,
your goodness.
And still feel the fire of  motivation and energy within you.
You can remind yourself at any time.
There is no limit to your positivity and goodness.
There's no limit to your possibility.
And so, we prepare to finish our session today
with this last countdown.
And we'll start it with:
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
