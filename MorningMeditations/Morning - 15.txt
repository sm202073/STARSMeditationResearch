welcome to your five-minute meditation
for peace re-centering
and balance
sometimes we feel like we need to
dedicate 20 or 30 minutes or more
to get into a deep meditative practice
however
let this experience in the next five
minutes remind you
that the real work is done the moment
you decide
to take even five minutes out of your
day
to breathe unplug and recenter your mind
so thank you for finding this moment
right now in your day
and doing something beautiful for your
inner peace and balance
let us begin today by coming into a
comfortable seated position
with your back straight your hands
rested on your knees or your lap
[Music]
close your eyes and just take
a deep inhale
and exhale out
exhale any tension
worry uncertainty or fear that you may
be feeling within you
today let it go with the intention of
emptying yourself to welcome only
positive and
radiant energy that serves you and your
inner being
[Music]
inhale
and exhale
[Music]
inhale deeply into your own heart
feel the strength of your heart
feel the beauty of your heart
[Music]
feel the power of your heart
[Music]
see yourself inhaling powerful healing
energy
into this beautiful heart allowing this
energy to nourish
every part of your body from within
inhale
[Music]
and as you exhale see yourself letting
go
of the low vibrational energy that
continues to linger
there is no room for this anymore
empty your heart as you exhale
empty it out let go
of the fear because you are powerful
let go of the doubt because you are
guided
let go of the pain
because you are protected
let it go
[Music]
inhale
and exhale
[Music]
stay with your breath
notice any sensations that begin to
arise within your body
or your mind be the watcher
don't attach yourself to anything but
the simple action
of inhalation and exhalation
[Music]
let each breath guide your heart
to gratitude
finding gratitude for this beautiful day
for your strong and healthy body
for your creative and powerful mind
inhale
and exhale
stay here for a moment or for as long as
you need today
[Music]
simply being one with the pure awareness
of breath and your pure energy flow
thank you for being here
thank you for breathing with me
never forget that you are powerful
that you are loved and that you are love
thank you have a beautiful day
