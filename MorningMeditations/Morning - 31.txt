as you settle into a comfortable seated
position
whether it is on the floor a chair
or your bed take a moment to feel
the sensations of your breath
[Music]
in and out
as you breathe thank yourself for
showing up today
and if you're part of the 14 day boho
beautiful mindfulness journey
welcome to day two
as you take your next breath take this
opportunity
to connect deeper with that inner flame
of strength
and power that exists within you
[Music]
bring your awareness to your heart
close your eyes
[Music]
and feel it
with each beat of your heart
feel this energy beginning to radiate
within you
with each breath feel each beat of your
heart
breathe it in
and let it go
[Music]
i truly believe that the universe divine
energy
never brings anything to us that we
cannot handle
and even in those moments when the going
gets hard
these challenges force us to dig a
little deeper
to look a little closer into ourselves
to search and
find this incredible strength and power
that is already within
so take another breath in
filling your lungs with pure oxygen and
feel this strength this fire within you
so for today's meditation let us set an
intention to bring forward this powerful
force that is within us
to awaken that flame that is always
burning inside of us
[Music]
now let's bring our awareness to our
heart
letting the heaviness dissolve as you
exhale
exhaling the tension into the ground
giving it away to mother earth
with each beat of your heart let
yourself be reminded that
you are powerful an
alchemist of your own future
here to conquer this incredible life in
every way that it is presented to you
so breathe in
and breathe out
[Music]
feel the light the strength
the fire now whenever you're ready you
may slowly introduce our mantra for
today's meditation
which will be your guiding light in
helping you find presence
and awareness through stillness
the power is within me
the power is within me
now stay with your heart stay with your
breath
stay with this mantra repeating it
silently
in your mind
[Music]

it's time to slowly
begin to bring awareness back to your
body
back to your breath
releasing your mantra if you've been
repeating it
breathe in
and breathe out
