take a moment to get comfortable
[Music]
finding a seated position with your
hands resting
on your knees close your eyes
and begin to simply focus on the
sensations of your breath
in and out
check in with how you're feeling in this
very moment
[Music]
let go of tension let go of any
heaviness
allow yourself to simply become aware
of each deep breathing
and long exhale out
thank you for being here with me today
[Music]
thank you for showing up for your
well-being
if you're joining me as part of the boho
beautiful 14-day
meditation journey welcome to day 12.
deep breath in
and let it go
to your own stillness to your own
peaceful energy within
[Music]
stay with your breath go inward
our practice today will be focused on
connecting deeper
with that internal fire within
the internal fire of your soul
the one that guides you forward even
when the going gets tough
[Music]
so take a deep breath in and look within
what is it that ignites your inner fire
[Music]
never let the world put out your inner
flame
through this journey that is filled with
challenges
success and opportunities we will always
encounter certain individuals or
situations
that will try to dim our inner light
whenever you find yourself in a
situation where you feel your power
your confidence your inner light being
challenged
don't be afraid to shine brighter
you have come into this world with your
own unique and authentic energy
your purpose your gift
and your love to share with this world
so look inside a little deeper
connect with that inner light that fire
that is burning inside of your soul
calling you to step up
embrace all that you have become
it's time to invoke your potential
your power step forward through the
light
of your heart
breathe in
breathe out
connect with it let it guide you
through this beautiful journey
go deeper into stillness
as you continue to connect with your
heart
breathing in deeply
[Music]
now as you let go
allow yourself to melt into the
stillness
as you take the next moment to stay in
this energy
feel free to use the following mantra if
you begin to feel distracted by your own
thoughts or external sensations
i invoke the eternal fire of my soul
i invoke the internal fire
of my soul stay present
repeating this silently in your mind
and go within
