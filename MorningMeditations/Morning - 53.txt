You are invited to take this  time to center yourself,
improve your connection with yourself,
and, if necessary, forgive yourself.
You are worthy.
To get us started, find a position that  is comfortable for you for this session.
It could be seated in a chair  with hands resting on your legs,
or cross-legged on a pillow or bed.
Begin to prepare your body  by relaxing your muscles,
yet remembering to remain focused  and present throughout our time.
Relax your jaw,
your shoulders,
your arms.
Bring that relaxing energy down through your body,
into your legs.
All the way down out the tips of your toes.
Just relaxing every muscle a bit more.
And as you do, begin to focus on your breath.
Just letting it move in and out.
Just as naturally as you had been breathing  before you were thinking about it.
Notice that gentle chest movement,
the airflow in and out of your nostrils.
Just so comfortable and present.
Continuing to relax,
bring yourself further and  further into this present moment,
and become ready to hear the  words of today's session.
Each day presents us with many challenges,
and through all of it,
we are often the harshest critics of ourselves.
Our minds can lead us down paths of  unnecessary stress and dissatisfaction.
It can become a weight and a burden on us.
A heaviness pressing us slowly down.
But the wonderful part of this process
is that we are capable of reminding  ourselves that we are worthy.
We are worthy of peace.
Worthy of a still mind.
Worthy of self-love.
We can let go of the mental baggage  
so that we can freely deal with the  challenges that are truly in front of us.
And throughout this process  forgiving ourselves for mistakes
and recognizing how to improve as we move forward.
Always looking forward.
So as you continue to get settled in,
take one or two deep and  comfortable breaths, if you like.
Feeling your chest fill and release.
Relaxing more and more each time,
but also remembering to stay present.
Try this for several cycles,  if it feels comfortable.
Those deep breaths in and out.
And slowly allow your breath just  to settle into a natural pattern,
but always keeping your  attention on that continual flow:
in and out.
You can use this time to remind  yourself of the constant cycle of life.
Your breath,
your heartbeat,
your blood flow.
All the tiny miraculous processes that make  it possible for you to be here in this space.
Feeling the sensations of the room.
You are focused and present,
yet still relaxed.
Just enjoying each moment here and now.
So now, I invite you to take one minute
to silently remind yourself to remain centered
and enjoy this calm and peace.
Remembering that this, right now, is your time.
Remembering that you are worthy of this.
Recognizing each breath in and out, we start now.
Great.
And now, I invite you to bring  focus to this idea of self-worth
by repeating a few of these short affirmations.
You can say them out loud or in your head.
Just slowly repeating them after  me or just listening to them.
Starting now:
"I am worthy."
"I am worthy of love."
"I am worthy of being forgiven."
"I am worthy of joy."
"I am worthy of peace."
"I am worthy of stillness."
"I am worthy."
Excellent.
And so, now, as you are here in this  calm, focused, and present space,
we can remind ourselves that negativity,  doubt, belittling self-thought:
all of this is not useful or  beneficial to our self-improvement.
By keeping a daily awareness of our thoughts,
we can recognize these intrusive thoughts.
Catch them as they happen.
And then, with the next gentle breath outward,
can just allow them to float away
and give no time or energy to them.
Through this process, we recognize our worth
and then become free to  pursue our real challenges.
Our goals and our aspirations.
And so, now, I share with  you a few last affirmations
that I once again invite you to  repeat after me, if you so choose.
Beginning now:
"With this next breath, I release negativity."
"With this next breath, I embrace this moment."
"With this next breath, I see my worth."
"With this next breath, I am at peace."
Fantastic job.
You are capable of being at peace.
You are capable of being connected  to each and every moment.
Remember this as you go forth into each day,
each hour,
each breath.
So now, if you like,
spend a few more minutes here in  this place of peace and presence.
As you reflect on them,
allow yourself to feel them twice as deeply,
twice as true.
Let these ideas comfort you twice as much.
And know that you are worthy of being forgiven.
You are worthy of joy.
You are worthy of peace.
You are worthy of stillness of the mind.
You are worthy.
