this is a meditation session on coping
with physical pain our pain comes in
many forms
whether a temporary injury or a chronic
condition it may be something that comes
and goes or may be virtually continuous
it also may be spread throughout a large
area of our bodies or may be very
focused and acute whatever the situation
you can use this meditation to shape the
experience to fit the kind of pain that
you are experiencing also keep in mind
that meditation should serve as just one
of a number of approaches to dealing
with pain including the possibility of
physical therapy and natural remedies
and dr. approved medication as we begin
find as comfortable of a position as you
can while also remaining alert and
present in both body and mind
you may choose to sit cross-legged on
the floor and if that is a bit
uncomfortable you can lean back on a
wall or sit in a chair or even lie down
if you are able to retain your focus and
to begin just start to bring focus to
your breathing and to your body start to
take gentle and comfortable breaths
inward and outward not forcing anything
but just breathing naturally focusing on
that breath calmly speaking to yourself
each time in
and end out bring awareness to the flow
of the energy throughout your body
[Music]
realize just how rare it is that we
focus on certain parts of ourselves
unless we're feeling some kind of pain
in that area yet we can bring attention
to ourselves and our bodies at any time
try bringing focus to the nerve endings
of your toes
and now feel that move up down your arms
and into your fingertips may just feel
that slight tingling sensation as you
bring your focus there you can feel the
surface of where you're sitting or
leaning
[Music]
and since the feeling of the clothes
that you're wearing can notice whether
there's a presence of light in the room
and where that's coming from
and what it feels like you can feel your
eyes or eyelids whether they're open or
closed just becoming aware of yourself
and everything around you
[Music]
and if you begin to focus enough you
might even get the sense that you are
not yourself apart from the rest of the
world and the universe but you're just
merging with it
becoming one becoming one with it just
being able to observe it and right now
if your eyes remain open as you continue
a calm pattern of breathing in and out
you may wish to find a point of focus in
the room again if your eyes are still
open don't don't let them strain just
softly focus and allow yourself to feel
the weight of your eyelids start to grow
not a weight like you're falling asleep
but just a weight of heaviness of focus
of being present in this moment feel
that weight grow as you become more and
more focused more and more aware
and as you continue settling in you may
be feeling your pain condition right now
or be able to imagine how it feels when
it happens your pain may cause you to
become frustrated or angry or sad
her pain
for many people and many different ways
a part of our life and it's in our
nature to want nothing more than to
avoid that pain and run away from it
make it go away right now but for now
let's just try something a bit different
[Music]
let's dive further into focus
by having you repeat these short phrases
after me whether out louder in your head
just repeating slow breath
so breath
[Music]
Kahn focused
[Music]
calm focused
[Music]
so breath
[Music]
calm focused calm focused
[Music]
calm focused aware
now continue to allow yourself to sink
in to that deep state of comfort yes we
can maintain that until comfort even
through the physical pain
and retain that strong and welcoming
focusing energy
[Music]
and now at this time I want you to bring
your focus again to your pain if you're
feeling it now or the feeling that
arises when the pain becomes strong
think of the part or parts of your body
that feel that pain most intensely
imagine the emotional feelings that it
brings up in you when the pain is
happening keep this in mind our goal is
not to eliminate the pain completely but
to bring ourselves to a better
understanding of our pain to find a
relationship with that vein
[Music]
and as we do so now allow for one number
for each breath and count down count
down with me
just repeat there in your head or out
loud
[Music]
slowly breathing
and on your next breath five I recognize
my pain
five I recognize my pain
for I am learning to understand my pain
for I am learning to understand my pain
[Music]
three I recognize the emotions that
arise from my pain
three I recognize the emotions that
arise from my pain
[Music]
- I acknowledge my pain
[Music]
- I acknowledge my pain
one I am learning to understand my pain
[Music]
one I'm learning to understand my pain
[Music]
great job
now as you continue to find even
stronger focus and awareness than before
you have not done so already I just want
you to gently close your eyes you might
have a long time ago
now in the center of where you would be
looking if your eyes were open imagine
your pain in front of you see it and
visualize it in any way that comes to
mind for some it might be a fiery
glowing orb
or maybe a mass of thorns
it might look angry or bright
intimidating uninviting whatever you see
bring all your focus and attention to
that object
[Music]
bring that attention
[Music]
get very clear right in front of you
and now again their attention focused
repeat after me
continuing to acutely see that ball of
pain before you and follow the
suggestions slowly breathing and
counting and focusing five I see my pain
[Music]
or
I see my pain shrinking away
[Music]
three
I observe myself controlling my pain too
I see my pain
and one
I see my pain shrinking away
[Music]
and let it shrink
way away away
[Music]
excellent job right now your pain if you
are presently feeling it maybe slightly
better or it may be just the same either
way it's fine
what you are accomplishing is very
important which is raising your
awareness of your pain rather than
letting your frustration sadness or
anger take over in times that your pain
worsens even might feel unbearable just
return yourself to these thoughts I see
my pain
[Music]
I see my pain I recognize my pain I
recognize my pain I understand my pain I
understand my pain
[Music]
now if you like just take another few
moments slowly gently focusing on your
breathing
just allow yourself to gently come back
out of this meditation remember you can
bring yourself back whenever you feel
the need to regain focus and give
yourself a reminder relaxed awake endo
air
[Music]
[Music]
you
