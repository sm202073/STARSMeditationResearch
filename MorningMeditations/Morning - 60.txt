allow yourself this time to find a comforting  balance and centeredness within yourself
find a comfortable spot where you can  bring focus and attention for this time
begin by breathing gently in and out
as you start to take notice  of your pattern of breathing
just allow your arms and legs to release any  tension let gravity pull them gently downward
continue to feel that gentle breath
in and out  
and again bring your focus and attention to it
your chest moving up and down
slowly and comfortably
and on your next breath
as you breathe out just let  your limbs relax even further
releasing any of that remaining tension
during this time you may become  especially aware of your senses.  
the feeling of the surfaces you're touching  against the amount of light in the room
you may hear detailed sounds that may have  otherwise gone unnoticed and all of these are fine
just allow yourself to experience  these and accept them without judgment
just take that time to find the  centered feeling of the present moment
as you become increasingly  aware and increasingly centered
you will become open to contemplate our  topic of focus for today being the boundless
finding acceptance and being your best self
What does it mean to become the boundless? It  means to unlock what we already have within us  
it is to find acceptance within  ourself and with our surroundings  
and ultimately it is to make way  for our best self to shine through.
we will now do five short affirmations or  short phrases which you can repeat after me  
either out loud or in your head and then we'll  take a moment of silent contemplation to reflect  
let's try this now repeating after me and  allowing yourself to become more and more present  
here in this moment as we count Five: I welcome this moment
Four: I become present
Three: I open my heart and mind
Two: becoming my best self
One: becoming the boundless
when we talk about being present, it does not mean  that we cannot actively learn from our past and  
future it means that we avoid the unconscious  clutter and noise that fogs our true path
looking forward actually means being present  but with a purpose just as when we are walking  
we understand that each foot is placed one in  front of the other with a clarity of purpose  
of being successful through that clarity of mind  cutting through the noise of our unconscious mind.
And so, with these ideas present we once again  count using our affirmations starting now.
Five: I welcome this moment
Four: I become present
Three: I open my heart and mind
Two: Becoming my best self
One: Becoming the boundless
Great! Now as you go forth embrace  these ideas to anchor yourself in the  
present while learning from your past and  looking ahead into the future with purpose.
you understand how failure is a teaching tool and  how we must learn from it yet also let them go
you understand how to embody success to  clarify your goals and connect deeply  
both within yourself and others  and you understand what it means  
to be the boundless to become your  best self and lastly going forward  
we remind ourselves to be grateful for  the earth for good fortune for good deeds
we take all of this with us as we move  forward into the days and weeks to follow
And so, counting one last time  with numbers only we prepare  
to finish this session and continue forward with  a powerful new mindset becoming the boundless
becoming the boundless
