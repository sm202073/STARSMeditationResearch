[Music]
it is so easy
to allow our mind to let us get lost in
thought
this can lead to fear negativity
or unnecessary pain
imagine if all of our thoughts would
stay focused
on either what is happening in the
present moment
or on those thoughts that are truly
helpful and beneficial
to what is real
imagine if all of our thoughts would
stay positive
and helpful in nature and we'd have the
ability to
separate out all of that useless baggage
that our mind carries like a heavy
weight
[Music]
imagine stepping back and watching your
thoughts
arise but staying disconnected
almost laughing at them as you let them
float away
recognizing that they are just
distractions
and burdens or better yet
imagine that you become fully present
if unwanted thoughts or unhelpful
thoughts do arise
you are able to just let them float away
before you can even process them
maybe even subconsciously without even
doing any work
wouldn't that be freeing wouldn't that
make
for a better life every single day
when you allow yourself to see this
you can deal with any real challenges
head on
with greater clarity and you can
appreciate those moments of presence
more often more fully
let's focus on that as we do our
positive
affirmation meditation
so now as i always do
i ask you to sit comfortably
[Music]
stretch a bit if you wish
loosening up your neck and shoulders
and gently bring your attention to your
breathing
focus on the air movement in and out of
your nostrils
or you may choose to direct your
attention to your chest
gently rising and falling
and if you like take a few
deep and rejuvenating breaths as you
settle in
[Music]
you may choose to leave your eyes open
yet relaxed
allowing your gaze to settle on an
object
across the room or in the distance
[Music]
or you may instead allow your eyes to
gently close
yet keeping yourself alert
and focused
[Music]
and now keeping that attention
on your breath and body
allow yourself to feel a deep sense
of the present moment
your head your arms legs
hands and feet
allow yourself to be here
now
and finally as you breathe
so gently
to get ourselves fully into this moment
just count slowly either out loud
or in your head from five
to one
five
four
[Music]
three
[Music]
two one
and with gentle breathing
[Music]
we'll do that once again and just a
touch
slower this time starting from
five
[Music]
four
three
two
[Music]
one
and now we move into the positive
affirmation phase
as with the counting feel free
to repeat after me in your mind
or say these phrases out loud
directly after me
i'll be sure to leave you enough space
in between
so now we begin
[Music]
i recognize my breath
i recognize my body
i am strong in mind and spirit
[Music]
i am the watcher of my thoughts
[Music]
i am here in the present moment
i am free of judgment of myself
[Music]
i am free of judgment
of others
[Music]
i love and accept myself
i focus on what brings me contentment
i am capable of deep joy
i am thankful for all that i have
i accept that which i cannot change
[Music]
i am grateful for my past
present and future
i can let go of negativity
[Music]
this moment is enough
[Music]
i am here now
[Music]
free of fear full of joy
[Music]
excellent job thus far that finishes up
this
first set of affirmations
[Music]
and now we will go through them once
again
and now that you're familiar with them
as you say each phrase
feel each one very deeply
let every word hit with great force
and feeling as we begin again
[Music]
i recognize my breath
i recognize my body
[Music]
i am strong in mind and spirit
[Music]
i am the watcher of my thoughts
[Music]
i am here in the present moment

accept that which i cannot change
[Music]
i am grateful for my past present
and future
[Music]
i can let go of negativity
this moment is enough
i am here now
free of fear full of
[Music]
and joy those words sink deeply
just taking a few more gentle relaxed
breaths
being here in this moment
just enjoying this moment
[Music]
and now if you like you can stay here in
this moment for
as long as you wish
or you can go on with the rest of your
day
or allow yourself to drift off to sleep
[Music]
