welcome to out day 9 guided meditation for healing
im so grateful you've chosen to be here with me today
to take some time for yourself
and dedicate this meditation
to healing any part of you
that is needing to be healed
healing doesn't always mean physical healing
it can also be emotional mental
or spiritual
whatever it may be that you're struggling with today
a physical injury, ill ness
emotional heart ache
understand that our minds are far more powerful than we give them credit
everything in life is energy
you and i are energy
our thoughts are energy
so knowing this
we can bring healing peace and joy
into our lives if we truly
begin to focus on only allowing
positive high frequency
energy to surround us
your body's ability to heal
is greater then anyone
has permitted you to believe
so knowing this
set intention for todays meditation
on healing that which you know needs to be healed
may it be physical or emotional
welcoming more positive
energy to fill you with strength
health and well being
with that said
lets begin our meditation together
finsding a comfortbale seated position
lets begin by closing your eyes
resting your hands on your knees
palms of your hands open to the sky
so we can allow positive energy
to flow into our body
and our heart
allow yourself to become completely open from within
bring all your awarenss
to your breath
inhale and exhale
knwoticing your heart beating in your chest
your lungs expanding and contracting
bringing oxygen into your body
filling your body with peace
calm and stillness
bring your awareness to your face
allowing yourself to fully
relax your forehead
allowing your eyes to feel heavy
unclench your jaw
completely let go of your face
slowly bring awareness down to the shoulders
feeling sense of relaxation
inhale
allow yourself to feel fully grounded
feeling the support of the ground underneath you
surrendering to this ground
feeling heavy in the body
but light in the heart
take this moment to bring awareness to that area of your body
that needs to be healed
if its emotional bring your awarenss
to your heart
and if you can't pin point the area then simply bring awareness to your third eye chakra
space between two eyerows
bring all your focus to that area as you continue to breathe
let go deeper into your meditative state
deep breath in
exhale let it go
allow this light to fully overcome your with healing love and peace
allow it to flow into your body
starting from the crown of your heaf
all the way down to your toes
filling each and every part of your body
bring special awareness to
that part of that seeks healing
as you continue to feel this energy fill your body
lets introduce our mantra
I'm healthy I'm strong I'm healing
I'm healthy I'm strong I'm healing
I'm healthy I'm strong I'm healing
repeat this mantra silently in your mind
as you continue to focus on surrounding to the beauty
of light of healing
I'm healthy I'm strong I'm healing
now silently in your mind
its time to release the mantra
begin to bring awareness to your body
take deep breath in and out
inhale and exhale
let all that air release
whenever you're ready you may begin to move
each finger and each toe
feeling positive powerful energy running through your body
take some time to sit with this energy if you like
opening your eyes whenever you're ready
remember your mind is extremely powerful
your thoughts can manifest
into your body through physcial
form
so as you go on with your day try your best to stay positive
vibrant and kind
send loving energy into the world
so more loving positive energy can come back to you
