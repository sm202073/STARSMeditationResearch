hi guys welcome to our meditation
stress relief
today we are going to take a moment
to let all of that negative energy leave your body
if you've had a stressful day
if you;ve had a busy day
this is the perfect time for you to take
the time for yourself
and let go of all that energy that no longer serves you
beginning to relax our body
by rolling our shoulders back
a few times
big circles with the shoulders
again letting go of all that energy thats been stored
within your shoulders thorough out your day
and then doing a head roll to the right
letting go of any tension in the neck
head roll to the left
and gently placing your right arm to the side
and taking a big side stretch
up to center
other side
and then coming back to center
coming back to your comfortable possition
and at this time come your eyes
and resting your hands on your knees
taking a couple of deep breaths
allow yourself to bring all of your
awareness to your breath
and if you need to take some extra time
to release feel free to take as many breaths as you like
as were sitting here with our eyes closed
i would like you to bring yourself
to a happy place
in you mind
it may be on a beach
maybe in front of a beautiful water
maybe in a personal place
like a cottage
or your old home
anywhere where you feel safe
and happy
imagining this place in your mind
seeing the wonderful details
about each and every place
and taking a seat in your mind where ever you are
in your mind
allowing yourself
to fully let go
of your body weight
in your happy place
now i would like you to take a deep breath in
gathering all
that energy
everything that has stressed you out today
anything that bothered you
and as you exhale
letting all of that energy
all of those things that bothered you
today away
and out of your body
and again deep breath
let it all go
you are peaceful
and safe
in your happy beautiful place
you can take as many breaths as you like
here
if you've had a super stressed out day
feel free to take some extra time
to breath and let go
visualizing yourself
exhaling
anything that no longer serves you
and inhaling all the positive energy
into your body
almost imagining like you're inhaling
beautiful white light
energy of happiness
joy
compassion
kindness
and love
continuing to breath for a few moments
letting go
of the old
and inhale the present
and whats to come
and now slowly
when you're ready
gently move your fingers
beginning to be aware
of your hands
and gently take yourself
away from your beautiful place
and as you slowly begin to open your eyes

continuing to take deep breaths
feel yourself
lighter
carefree
and content
with where you are
and who you are
and know that anything that
has happened through out your day
or anything that has happened throughout the past
has no longer
any power or effort over your mind
it has no control
over who you are
and what the future holds for you
deep breath in
lets lengthen your spine
and exhale slowly
bring your hands down to your
heart
lets do that one more time
deep breath in
biggest breath of the vening
exhale bring your arms down
to your heart
and just staying here for a moment
and thinking of everything
that you are grateful for
in your life
everything that makes you happy in your life
and then when you're ready you can slowly
release your arms down
to your body

better
more relaxed
and stressfree

of all that negative energy
we tend to hold on to
within our selves
and allow yourself
to renew your body
your mind
for the day to come
