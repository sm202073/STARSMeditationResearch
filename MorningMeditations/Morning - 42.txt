to close off a journey than by
meditating and by reconnecting with our
own hearts and with our own energy

beating

practice grab your mat
and let's begin
alright so let's begin today in a seated
position
now if you can come into a cross-legged
position that's great you can also just
place one foot over the other
or if seated cross-legged position isn't
something that you're comfortable with
today you can also just sit on a chair
or on a couch and plant your feet onto
the floor
wherever you are let's bring our hands
in our lap you can stack your hands one
over the other and just
place them here or if you wish you can
just rest them on your knees
whatever your positioning of your body
is we just want to make sure that we're
comfortable
that we can really relax the body let's
close our eyes
and take this opportunity right now to
bring
our awareness internally
the way we do that is by first
focusing on the simple act of inhalation
and exhalation so
taking a deep breath in through both of
your nostrils
feeling the sensations of air of oxygen
coming into your body
and then a very long and gentle
exhalation
letting go of that air out of your body
and feeling a beautiful sense of peace
and relaxation overcome your entire body
through this peaceful relaxation feeling
your shoulders
drop away from the ears
your neck your spine is becoming long
your body is relaxed
let's take another deep breath in
through both nostrils
at this time noticing the sensations
of the air coming in so notice the
coolness of the air
the sound of your breath
and as you exhale keeping that awareness
notice the warmth of the air leaving
your body
the sound of a gentle exhalation
filling you with relaxation
and peace
[Music]
relax your face
let go of any emotion in your forehead
allow your eyes to be relaxed and heavy
bringing your awareness to a point
between your two eyebrows your third eye
chakra
noticing anything that you may see
in this particular moment
see if there's colors shapes
or maybe nothing at all just pure
void and blackness whatever it is
just find this mindful awareness of what
you're experiencing right now in this
very moment
as you continue to breathe with each
exhalation
just feel your shoulders drop away from
the ears
[Music]
feel the heaviness on your shoulders
relax
and melt away out of your body
[Music]
take a deep breath in
fill your lungs with oxygen
welcoming a beautiful chronic energy
into every cell of your being
and as you exhale let go
let go of anything that
no longer serves your ultimate truth
your ultimate self
[Music]
let go of any negativity
any doubts any fears you may be holding
on to
any worries whatever it is that
bothers you right now in this moment or
has been bothering you
for this particular moment in time right
now
as we are here together let us let go of
all of those worries and thoughts
and revel in this beautiful
connection of our breath
with our heart
[Music]
just take a moment in this
silence and notice
be a complete watcher of everything
that's going on internally
[Music]
notice how your body is feeling
notice if you're still holding on to any
tension within the body
if you notice it bring that breath
into that area and let go
let it all go there's no need
to hold on to any more of that
[Music]
take another deep breath in
and exhale out
whatever you've gone through in the last
two weeks
may you find gratitude
for everything that you've accomplished
everything that you've been through
everything that you've challenged
yourself with
[Music]
you be proud of yourself
[Music]
grateful for your own strength for your
own power
for your patience and self-love
keep breathing as you continue to let go
deeper
and deeper
[Music]

gratitude
for everything that you are for
everything that makes you
who you are your perfections
and imperfections

you bring forward

on
in bettering yourself every single day

[Music]

[Music]

become so far

everything that's around you in your
life

become more and more in tune with this
energy that you're creating
this light that you're radiating out of
your heart

to come back to no matter what the
external world may bring our way

back
to your body

oxygen just

radiating out of you
[Music]

movement into your fingers and your
hands

to your own heart
