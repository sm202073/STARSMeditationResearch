Welcome to our meditation for acceptance
The focus of of meditative practice today will be unaccepting and embracing our own path and the way life takes us through it
It's important to always set goals and set out
Expectations for ourselves in order to help ourselves become more motivated productive and driven in our lives
However, it's important. Especially when it comes to setting expectations that we realize
that achieving those goals and attaining success is only a part of the journey the
Process of becoming the best we can be in whatever scalar area we focus on is
What truly makes the journey of life that much more special?
growth lies in our struggle and
In those difficult times when we truly see how strong we are in those moments
We'll make that decision to no longer be treated a certain way is when we find our own self-worth
It's in those moments when everyone around you says that your goal, or dream is too big too unattainable
That we have to dig up that fire and believe in ourselves to continue and push through it
That is the journey and without the struggle and the hardships the success and the victory will not taste a sweet
So as you move through your everyday life, and do your best every day to be the best you can be
Learn to accept and embrace all that comes your way
Focus on each present moment
Find something to be grateful for each day
So you can truly open your heart to the idea that everything is part of this beautiful path that you create for yourself each day
Open your heart to the universe and
Accept everything as it comes with love and positivity
Even when it's the last thing you want to do
Learn to love and accept yourself as you are right now beautiful and wonderful
Know that everything in your life is flowing the way needs to be
Learn to flow with the current. Don't resist it
surrender
Trust the process in the end everything will be okay, and if it's not that means it's not the end
With that said let's begin our meditation find a comfortable seated position either on the floor or on your bed
Sit up tall and place your hands and Yana mudra
Simply sit with your hands facing upward right hand resting on top of your left palm
Close your eyes and start to deepen your breath
Inhale and exhale slowly and deeply
With each exhale allow yourself this time to let go of any negativity or tense energy
Seeing this energy leave your body with each exhale
Give yourself permission to go further into your relaxed state of mind
Bring your awareness to your heart
Feel your heart beating in your chest
with each bead
Reminding you that you're alive
Happy and healthy
Inhale
And exhale
Feel your eyes become heavy
Bring your awareness to that space between your two eyebrows your third eye chakra
Notice if you see any patterns or colors appear as you breathe
Simply take note and continue to breathe
Inhale and exhale
Let go of any thoughts or worries give yourself permission to be completely one with your breath
Become the watcher of your thoughts
if any thoughts or ideas start to rise
simply accept and
Then let them go
Seeing these thoughts drown away like a stone sinking to the bottom of the lake its gently let go
Inhale and exhale out
As you stay here with your breath
Let's introduce our mantra
focusing on this mantra, or simply coming back to it whenever you notice your mind starting to wonder I
Surrender to the path of my own journey I accept and embrace the process I
Surrendered to the path of my own journey I accept and embrace the process I
Surrender to the path of my own journey I
accept and embrace the process
And now silently in your mind until you hear soft Bell letting you know it's time to release the mantra
It's time to release the mantra
Slowly come back to your breath
Deepening each inhale
Along getting each exhale
Give yourself permission to be still for a little longer
Or slowly open your eyes if you're ready as you move on with your day today
Keep this intention and mantra in your mind
accepting all that comes your way and
Opening yourself to the process of life
Knowing that no matter what happens it will all work out the way, it's meant to be
Surrender spread love and accept each present moment
Every breath is a gift love and light namaste
You
