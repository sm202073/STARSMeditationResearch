practice
let us begin today by finding a comfortable seated position at the center of your mat
feeling yourself balanced and grounded as we take a deep breath in and reach both of our arms up to the sky
starting our practice with this beautiful welcoming breath in and as you exhale bring your hands down
together towards your heart feeling the energy between your hands close your eyes let's go inward for a
moment before we begin to move breathe and Flow
let us connect to today's intention the intention of rooting ourselves in the idea of creating a strong Foundation
not just for the seven day Journey or your personal yoga practice but through awareness opening ourselves up to the
idea that once we begin to build a strong daily foundation in our life we give ourselves the opportunity to
ascend upward from that point forward the first step in setting up a strong foundation in our practice and in our
life begins with coming to terms with the realization that where you are right now in your practice in your life
circumstance and In This Moment is exactly where you need to be so whether you're in a good place in
your life or in a place where you seek Improvement let's for this moment right now find
true peace with wherever you are in your personal Journey don't fight it or resist it but simply with a deep breath
completely and wholeheartedly accept yourself as you are so breathe in
and exhale out for the next seven days of this journey
each day we'll be focusing on a different chakra in our body a chakra is an energetic center that is
responsible for the free-flowing movement of a chronic energy and life force throughout our entire being
when a chakra is balanced and vibrant we thrive and when there are blockages we
experience their energetic restrictions in our life there are seven chakras and each stacked
in a perfect Divine ladder along the column of our own spines and each day we will Ascend up this energetic ladder
from the bottom to the top in order to balance and recharge each one in order that they are located
today we'll begin with the first one the root chakra which is located at the base of our spine and is responsible for your
sense of Safety and Security on this journey on Earth it consists of everything that grounds
us to stability in our life by working on opening and balancing a root chakra would give ourselves the
opportunity to feel more connected to ourselves to our mind and body and to the Earth
so let's take this moment again and just connect to our breath
and let it Let It Go Mother Earth is our first mother
our bodies formed from her elements she creates the ultimate foundation for our existence on this planet
so let's take another deep breath in and as you exhale feel yourself become grounded and held by Mother Earth
in a place of presence Stillness and perfection and with this feeling in your heart
let's repeat today's affirmation to open up our practice repeating softly after me
I am exactly where I'm supposed to be [Music]
wonderful now when you're ready release the hands onto the knees begin to welcome movement
into the body by bringing the chest forward towards the knees and back and around
creating this circular motion with your upper body with as much or as little movement as
you like just feel the energy feel yourself grounded
feel yourself awake in the body and then just reverse the motion reverse
to the other side [Music] really focusing on connecting to your
breath to your mind to your present awareness

and then slowly coming back to center dropping those shoulders away from the ears go ahead and open the palms of your
hands facing up towards the sky close your eyes

mat notice the Earth underneath your mat
feel yourself supported and held by Mother Earth as you take a deep inhalation into your
belly into the ribs into the chest and a slow exhalation out opening your
eyes and then from here just go ahead and move yourself so you're along the length of your mat continuing to sit in

and then from here transitioning into our wide legged forward fold by extending the bent knee and slightly
pigeon toe your toes towards each other to protect the knees as you release into
your wide legged forward fold keep your hands grounded on the mat or maybe it feels better to grab your
ankles wherever you are just really focus on allowing that head to come as close to
the Earth as possible a gentle inversion here to decompress the spine

inhale and then as you exhale bring your gaze down extending the bent knee flexing the
foot and then walk your hands to the middle of your mat as you bend that back knee and once again in your skandasana
you may want to stop here or maybe you want to go down even lower again my friends I just always want to
remind you to listen to your body and adjust to what feels right if you're down low and like to add
movement go ahead and bring your forehead down and up to the fluidity of your breath inhale

benefits that you need deep breathing again
then slowly exhale out as you bring yourself back to Center hands onto the
mat lift your hips up and then from here coming back into that
wide legged forward fold but then this time see if you can go further and bring your hands through
your legs if that's too much you can grab your ankles
