welcome to your end of day meditation
im so glad you have found the time
this evening to dedicate for yourself
your health and wellbeing
the end of day is a time
when the body and mind needs to wind down
and relax
they both have been engaged
working all day long to allow you to be who you are
and give the world all that youbring
so its time to take a comfortable position
may it be on the floor or your bed
close your eyes and
put some headphones on
its time to let your awareness
go inward
and your mind rest
sitting comfortably
placing your thumbs and index fingers together
on each hand
with your eyes closed
begin to focus on your breathing
inhale and exhale
inhale into your belly
feeling it expand outward
and then exhale all the air out
allowing it to deflate
inhale into the rub cage
feeling the ribs move outward into space
and letting all the air go
and then a little bit into your ribs
then letting all of that air go
from your ribs then from your belly
now taking a deep breath into your chest
feeling it expand outward
and then exhale all the air out
letting it go
combining all three together
on your next inhale
starting from your belly

moving upward to your ribs
and then all the way into your chest
and then exhaling all the air out
first from your chest
then your ribs
and then your belly
inhaling into your belly
into your ribs
into your chest
exhaling from your chest
ribs and belly
inhale belly ribs chest
exhale chest
ribs
belly
feeling any cool or warm sensations in your body
as you breath
inhale
and let it go
as you continue your three part breathing exercise
i want you to be the witness of your toughts
and see yourself going through your day
today
what you did this morning
what you ate
your interactions with others
the wide scope of emotions
and experiences
you might of had
the things you accomplished and perhaps the things
that you didn't
you must realize that today
is exactly what it was
the good or bad
what you think happened
over now
and all is well
tomorrow when you wake up you are the creator of a brand new day
today will be left behind
and you can start fresh
however you decide
so with this in mind
lets introduce our mantra
the entering thought for this meditation
i move forward and leave today behind
i move forward and leave today behind
as you sink deeper into your meditative state
with each inhale fill yourself
with gratitude
and fullfillment
of what you accomplished today
and with each exhale
let go of any negativity
or self judgement
that you feel maybe lingering in your mind
let it go
you did your best and tomorrow
is a fresh new start
staying present with your breath
inhale
exhale out
allow each part of your
face
and body to sleekly let go
and release
i move forward and leave today behind
i move forward
and leave today behind
i move forward and leave today behind
and now silently in your mind
its time to release the mantra
slowly begin to deepen your breath
moving each finger
wiggling each tow
at your own pace
slowly begin to open your eyes
or if you're ready for sleep
keep them closed
and move to a lying down position
remember
we are the creators of our own lives
we direct the flow of energy
in our lives based on our own thoughts
if you have felt
out of control in your life lately
stay with this mantra for the night
or as you fall asleep
to reassure yoruself
about your own inner power
to move forward
to what ever reality you decire
everyday is another chance
at a fresh start
and every night
is a chance to leave behind whatever
deosnt serve you
thank you so much for joining me
i hope you have a wonderful rest of your evening
and a restful sleep
namaste
