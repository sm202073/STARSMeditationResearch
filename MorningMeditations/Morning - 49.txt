[Music]
this is a meditation on contentment and
gratitude
allow yourself to take a step back
take a moment
take a gentle breath in and out
[Music]
continue to breathe naturally and gently
as you sit or lie comfortably begin to
notice every part of your body and where
you may be holding any remaining stress
or tension
[Music]
and now on each breath focus on a
different part of your body and feel the
release of the remaining tension in your
muscles as you start with your head
[Music]
moving down through your eyes
a releasing tension and the muscles in
your face
and then slowly down through your
shoulders and arms moving all the way
through and down to your legs and feet
and on the next gentle breath let any or
all of the remaining tension just melt
away
use these moments of focus and comfort
to allow yourself to draw attention to
these words
[Music]
just continuing to breathe gently and
naturally feeling that flow of the
breath in and out each time
what is true peace we so often strive so
hard to attain these goals and yet we
rarely ask ourselves how peace and
happiness are truly represented in our
lives
in the busyness of life we tend to take
all that we have for granted and only
focus on the negatives associated with
what we want but do not have
by taking a few moments each day to
focus on gratitude we can learn to feel
an appreciation of the everyday moments
all of the time this mindfulness will
lead to a greater sense of contentment
and eliminate restlessness and
unnecessary unhappiness
of course we still must deal with
problems and situations as they arise
but removing any unnecessary baggage
from our mind will only help us to
better focus on the problems that truly
need solving continuing to gently
breathe in and out focusing on the
movement of air and that gentle lift and
as you focus see the universe from a
distance see the beauty and see yourself
as a tiny speck amidst the vastness of
space and time
[Music]
maybe when we are searching for a grand
meaning and purpose what we are really
doing is missing what is right in front
of us what we see breathe taste smell
experience the love between one another
when you get lost take a breath
take a moment just like this one teach
yourself to just be
[Music]
you can be content and at peace with
nothing but an appreciation for what you
already have returned to these thoughts
or to this meditation
whenever you need a reminder contentment
and gratitude
you
