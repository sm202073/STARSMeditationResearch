this is a mindfulness guided meditation
by my neon dandelion
welcome
let us start today's session
by finding a comfortable
seated position
with a tall
straight back
allow your arms to rest gently
and when you're ready
close your eyes
bring your full attention
to this very moment
set yourself
ease
allow your body and mind
become Motionless
and bring your consciousness
to your breath
while remaining open
patient
curious
a thorough inhalation
and exhalation
follow your breath
as it enters
and exits your body
take a final deep inhale
then allow your breath settle
allowing it to seem natural
and effortless
do not attempt to control or compel your
breath
in any manner
just let things happen
on their own
spontaneously
we will now scan the body
top
to bottom
paying close attention
to each area
start by focusing on the crown of your
head
and the scalp
and sensing what is going on
there
you could experience throbbing
Heat
tingling
or gentle vibrations
you might feel nothing whatsoever
or
the sensation
might be very powerful
now shift your focus
to your jaw
face
and forehead
relax the muscles
in this area
let these Sensations vanish
if you're subsequent breath
foreign
letting the sides
back
and throat of your neck
become softer
take note of any Sensations
that appear either on the Skin's surface
or
deeper Within
bring your focus
back to your shoulders
and check to see
if there is any stress
or stiffness lying there
inhale deeply
into your shoulders
allowing any areas that feel tight
release
concentrate your attention
on your fingers
Palms
and wrists
As you move down your arms
allow them to relax
on your next breath
come now to the chest
and watch each breath
as it rises
and falls
observe your lungs expansion
and contraction
give your upper and lower back
special attention
given that we frequently hold stress in
this region
there may be considerable intensity here
simply pay attention
to what's there
if you feel any discomfort
one more attention
soften a tiny bit more
with each breath
circling your abdomen with
pay attention to your pelvis
as it expands
fills with air
and then slowly empties
as you exhale
direct your breath into this spot
relaxing into Stillness
where your body
meets the ground
or your chair
consider your thighs as you scan your
legs
paying attention
to where they make contact with the
cushion or chair
your legs can soften
and tension can be released
by focusing Less on your hips
and more on your knees
Shins
calves
breathe in through your toes
feet
and ankles when you're ready
let them sink into
state of at ease awareness
allowing them
soften
consider your feelings for a moment
as our session draws to a close
since meditation
frequently has this effect on people
you might discover
that you're more at ease
this is only one
of the many benefits of meditation
during stressful situations
when we are under stress
our amygdala
lights up
making it challenging
for us to make deliberate decisions
therefore meditation can be used as a
strategy
to quiet the Mind down
if we discover
that it is clouded as a result of
overwhelm
in an Ideal World
we would meditate as a preventative
measure
to avoid reaching that stage
this guided mindfulness meditation
from my neon dandelion
will always be here when you need it
bring your focus
back to the room as our session draws to
a close
wiggle your fingers and wriggle your
toes
and gradually
open your eyes
welcome back
I hope today's meditation
was an enjoyable experience for you
I encourage you to carry this
tranquility
you may now be feeling into the rest of
your day
