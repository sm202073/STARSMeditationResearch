Good morning, welcome to another beautiful day on this earth
May we take the next 10 minutes and gift ourselves a moment of internal connection to the energy that is within us
Let's begin today by taking a comfortable seated position on your mat or on the floor legs crossed in front of you
Let us rest our hands in her lap
elbows relaxed
Close your eyes and take this opportunity to simply connect with your breath
Inhale and
Exhale
Let us welcome this beautiful new day that has come upon us
Waking up to the feeling of being alive
Grateful to be here
To be able to breathe
to feel and
To be in the presence of the Sun the moon and the earth
Inhale
And exhale
Breathing in peace
breathing in calm
Breathing in love
joy compassion
Feel the sensations of each breath that you take
How it supports you
How it supports your body your life
With your exhale open your heart to gratitude
Thank you for being here
Thank you for taking this time to disconnect and reconnect to that deeper vibration and
frequency that pulses within you
The frequency of love
Freedom joy
Kindness compassion
Breathe in
And let it go
Give yourself permission to let go deeper into this beautiful meditative state
Feeling the sensations of your body and mind and letting go
Letting go of what's to come today in?
Simply finding an opportunity to give thanks for the sprat
this moment
in this life
Inhale
Exhale
Open yourself to whatever comes through this meditation
Whenever you catch your mind beginning to think of the future of the next moment
Bring it back to yourself through that connection to the breath of life
Inhale
And exhale
May this day be a clean slate for your mind or your being
For your actions and for your thoughts
May this day bring you peace and an opportunity to start anew
Breathing and welcome the beautiful renewed energy that is within you and all around you
In
And out
Feel the energy
Feel the breath
Feel this moment
And
in this state of true presence and blissful awareness
let us gently introduce a morning mantra to manifest and
Welcome positive and healing energy to guide us through the day to come
Repeating this mantra in your mind or simply using it if you begin to feel your mind wandering off into thought worry
Today is a beautiful day of opportunity. I am exactly where I need to be I
Open myself to the universe and trust in the unfolding of my life

Now it's time to slowly come back to our breath
Inhale and exhale
Slowly returning to your body
To your mantra to yourself
Take a deep breath in and let it go
Feel your body
Feel your love your presence
Feel your energy that is vibrating within you
Filling you with positive or radiant light to continue the rest of your day
Reminding you that no matter how your day may unfold today
