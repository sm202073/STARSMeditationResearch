Welcome to our meditation for living truthfully in our meditation today our focus will be on finding truth
Love and beauty within ourselves
So that we can project it out into the world around us
Many of us so often tend to complicate life in many ways
We feel that we must have a specific job title
On a specific car or live in a particular neighborhood in order to truly feel happy and accomplished with ourselves in our lives
Yes all of these things are wonderful in many ways, but they are not the root of our happiness
Actually finding happiness is quite simple
It doesn't come with a price tag because it is here within us every single day if we simply choose to look a little closer
Observing sometimes can be the first tool in helping you find happiness
Seeing the beauty of our existence around us whether that is a smile of a child a beautiful sunset
the smell of the ocean
Or the leaves falling off a tree on a sunny autumn day
Happiness lies in the simple things and once we open our eyes to the everyday miracles of life
existence itself becomes a miracle
Once we start to see how magical life really is we must look a little closer
Everyone around us that shares similar walk of life the human existence
Yes, we may have our differences in politics or religions, or simply how we see the world around us
But in the end if we truly realize that we''re all
Two-legged breathing talking loving human beings we will all begin to realize that we are all the same
We are all in this together
We are all one
We all want to be happy healthy and loved
Accepting this idea is one of the ways in helping us understand one another a little better
Understand that we are all struggling in our own personal ways
We all want to be loved and heard in one way or another and that we all want to find that happiness whatever
Way happiness looks to us
Once we start to understand that behind the egos and the power games deep down
We all share the same goals and purpose
We will see that the only way to living authentically and truthfully is through opening your minds to all paths and ideas of life
With that said let's begin our meditation
Begin by sitting comfortably on your mat your bed or the floor
Close your eyes
Rest your hands on the knees and begin to bring your awareness to your breath
Inhaling and exhaling slowly
Relax your face
Let go of any motion in the forehead allow your eyes to feel heavy and clench your jaw
Just simply allow all that tension to release out of your face and then out of your shoulders
Feeling yourself grounded and appease
Paying attention to your inhale and your exhale as you let go of everything else
Feel the coolness of the air as you breathe in and the warm of the airs you exhale
Let go of any thoughts to duel us or plants just simply be with yourself
Inhale
And exhale
Notice how you're feeling right now
Do you feel any tension in your body
Pay close attention
And with each exhale let it go
Let slowly introduce her mantra for today
Repeating this mantra in your mind are
Simply using it to bring you back to the present moment if your mind begins to go elsewhere throughout this meditation
I see beauty I seek truth. I am one with all
I see beauty I
Seek truth I am one without
I
See beauty I
Seek truth. I am one with all
And now silently in your mind
Until you hear a soft Bell letting you know that it's time to release the mantra
It's time to release the mantra
Slowly begin to deepen the breath
Inhale and exhale
Take your time here you
May sit in this stillness for as long as you like
Or if you're ready go ahead and open your eyes
As you go on through your day try to stay present today
Notice the beauty around you and the little things be grateful for each breath each moment that you have in this beautiful world
Choose to see the beauty of existence allow yourself to be guided by truth and wisdom of the universe
Share love and kindness with everyone around you
Open your heart and mind to all possibilities of life and
Know that as you start to change the way you look at things
The things you look at change
Love and light namaste
You
