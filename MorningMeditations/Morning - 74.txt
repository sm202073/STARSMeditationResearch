make sure that you're sitting
comfortably in whatever position suits
you you may wish to close your eyes
right now or leave them focused on
something for a bit before you allow
them to close in these next few minutes
of meditation this is your time to
simply be to be reminded of the radiant
energy of life in you and in all things
there is great joy in life there is deep
profound joy in simply being
as you allow your mind to focus on my
voice turn your attention to your
breathing
you don't have to change how you breathe
just focus on it as it happens
feel the air gently enter through your
nostrils and calmly escape as you exhale
for every moment in every day of your
life you are continuously breathing in
and out
this cycle this ritual is one of the
purest essences of your life yet how
rarely you think on it
now feel your belly gently rise and fall
and the air continues to flow ever so
gently and endowed
becoming increasingly present
in this moment
as you do this you may notice a thought
into your mind perhaps it's about
something that happened to you recently
or maybe a reminder about something you
must do before the end of the day
whenever you sense one of these thoughts
it's okay
recognize it but don't follow it any
further
once you gently process the thought let
your attention calmly return to your
breathing
don't get frustrated with yourself when
thoughts keep popping up in your mind
simply let them be as they are and
continue to calmly redirect your
attention as you let yourself become
relaxed and comfortable
as you continue this enjoyable process
the air gently moving through your lungs
turn your attention to your body
think about where your fingertips are
right now even if you do not move them
you can sense them in space
now envision your toes
you may feel a slight tingle as you
direct your attention to them now focus
on your eyelids they may feel heavy
relaxed
realize how good it feels to let your
eyes sit ever so gently closed as your
breath continues to calmly flow in and
out
now the next time you take a breath when
you exhale imagine a warm wave of
relaxation flowing from the top of your
head down to the tips of your toes
did you notice that tingling sensation
throughout your body isn't it an amazing
sense to bring to your own being without
even a single movement every few breaths
when it feels right to you try the same
process slowly exhaling and feeling a
warm gentle wave of relaxation flow
slowly from your head to your toes
have you noticed any tension that you
weren't previously aware of maybe you're
holding some in your shoulders but your
jaw the next time you send that calming
wave through your body let any tense
muscles just let go then relax
and each time you think of this imagine
a doubling of your relaxation as the
wave slowly moves down your body
you can do it you maybe realizing just
how simple this process is yet how
greatly it's calming your nerves to
realize yourself is the most profound
thing you can do yet we so often forget
to pay attention but not now now is your
time to be in the moment now is your
time to be
Joey
you are capable of feeling intense
wonderful profound joy right now you may
feel joy in thinking about certain
moments in the past but there is no joy
in the past because the past is not real
it's merely a memory but you are
experiencing it in the present there is
also no joy in the future because the
future is not real it is only
anticipation which can itself be joy but
you are experiencing it in the present
there can only be joy in this moment
right now and it can't be yours
feel the present joy that exists within
you it is a joy to breathe
take a breath to focus on this thought
in that one breath say it to yourself it
is a joy to breathe with subsequent
breaths repeat these mantras to yourself
I am alive it is a joy to be alive
I have a beating heart it is a joy to
have a beating heart
I can feel the energy in my body
it is a joy to feel this energy
now fill in more breaths with your own
joys
take a moment to think on it and then
say them to yourself in these next few
moments
now that you are in the serene state let
yourself simply continue to enjoy each
moment as you continue to feel the air
slowly move through your nostrils and
fill your lungs you let go of desire and
simply enjoy this moment here and now
feel the joy within you in the space
you're in in the ones you love
feel the joy in all things let yourself
be here now
you
you
