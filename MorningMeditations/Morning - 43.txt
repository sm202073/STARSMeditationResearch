[Music]
welcome to our meditation for healing
let us begin our practice today by
finding a comfortable seated position
on the ground or any comfortable surface
close your eyes
feel
your breath
in
and out
allow yourself to come into this present
state of awareness
you are here
in this moment
connecting
with all that you are
inhale
and exhale
healing is a very important part of our
journey on earth
no matter the pain
the sickness or injury you're trying to
overcome in this moment
remember the process of healing
gives us the opportunity to reset
to reconstruct
rebalance
and realign ourselves
everything in life is given to us with a
greater purpose
and it's important to remind ourselves
of this idea when life seems too
difficult to handle
you are given this opportunity right now
to rise
and here you are
breathe in
and breathe out
our thoughts
our words
our energy
always communicates with our internal
frequency of our body our mind and our
soul and so now let us take this
opportunity to open our heart
to breathe in deeply
and allow this breath
to create space within our heart
space for beautiful radiant
energy
healing
love peace
strength and vitality
to enter
our body at this time
breathe in deeply again
breathe out
feel your body
feel yourself
grounded supported
relaxed
feel yourself held by the strength of
the ground underneath you
and at this time allow yourself
to soften
to let go
to go within
slowly
and softly begin to bring your awareness
to the space between your eyebrows
that center space
feel it
notice if you can
see any
colors shapes
or perhaps just see the vast darkness
all that is within that area of your
body right now
feel the energy of the third eye
your third eye chakra
radiating
vibrating
inhale
and now with this breath begin to see a
beautiful radiant white light shining
above you
feel the energy of this light
feel its strength
it's love
the healing it is here to bring you
and the pain it is here to take away
from you
let's take another deep breath in
and exhale
let it go
now begin to guide this beautiful white
light
through your entire body
seeing it enter
every section of your body
moving through your body moving through
every limb
every organ
begin to see this radiant light
penetrate healing energy through every
cell
of your body
being tuned with how it feels right now
notice if you can feel any tingling
sensations
notice if you can
see
any colors visions
whatever may come to you just be open
stay connected to this beautiful healing
light
and allow it to regenerate your dna
cleanse you of all the toxicity
and fill you with the most beautiful
radiating light of love
energy and vitality
breathe it in
see it
feel it
surrender to it
let go
and open
your heart
simply
allow yourself to stay in this energy
and only softly
repeating these words to yourself
i am healthy
i am strong
i am guided
towards healing
and balance
i am healthy
i am strong
i am guided
towards healing
and balance
now stay in this blissful energy
repeating this affirmation softly to
yourself if you wish
and continue to guide
this beautiful white light
to heal you
and allow it to offer you the strength
and power
that you deserve to overcome whatever it
is you're facing right now in your life
breathe in
and
let
go
so
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
so
gently and softly
continue to stay with your breath
continue to stay in this beautiful
energy
that you have cultivated from within
breathing in deeply
and
exhaling softly
stay here for as long as you need to
continuing to repeat your affirmation if
that feels right for you
or just stay
in beautiful pure
silence
remember
the power is in your mind
you are capable of overcoming anything
that may be thrown your way along this
journey
remember
that you are healthy
you are strong
and you are always
guided towards a life
of healing
and balance
from my heart to yours
i thank you
i send you all my love
and light your way
namaste
you
