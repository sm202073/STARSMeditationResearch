Hey
welcome

help
reduce
anxiety
First
I
'd
like
invite
gently
close
eyes
take
nice
slow
deep
breath
deeper
've
taken
day
far
And
exhale
concentrate
sound
voice
allowing
ground
present
moment
giving
permission
right
focus
making
first
priority
There
nowhere
else
need
There
nothing
else
need
For
next
several
minutes
wellbeing
focus
Continue
take
slow
deep
breaths
allowing
inhale
bit
deeper

Feeling
lungs
expand
inhale
holding

contracting
back
exhale
And
continue
breathe

notice
places
may
holding
stress
anxiety
body
Unfurl
brow
unclench
jaw
Let
shoulders
drop
ears
Open
palms
And
allow
breath
return
normal
rhythm
pattern
keep
focus
allow
anchor
meditation
If
get
distracted
thought
sound
simply
acknowledge
occurred
gently
let
go
return
attention
breath
When
're
stressed
anxious
something
's
often
n't
feel
control
sense
control
make
us
feel
less
safe
emotions
heighten
An
understandable
reaction
try
control
situation
even
We
also
tend
judge
situation
even
feelings
Those
judgments
stories
tell
often
become
bigger
situation
adds
even
stress
cycle
repeats
So
right
I
invite
call
mind
situation
feel
causing
anxiety
What
judgments
holding
As
name
judgment
acknowledge
presence
Now
give
judgment
permission
drop
away
You
n't
need
anymore
Let
go
And
's
story
've
telling
situation
As
recognize
acknowledge
presence
give
story
permission
drop
away
well
You
may
notice
mind
pushing
even
harder
hold
onto
judgments
stories
Recognize
acknowledge
thoughts
allow
drop
away
well
Continue
use
breath
anchor
back
present
moment
get
distracted
Now
let
's
look
situation
without
judgment
story
telling
How
feel
different
Has
level
anxiety
stress
changed
Instead
I
invite
look
situation
total
curiosity
Now
move
silent
part
meditation
give
permission
open
clarity
direction
next
step
take
Not
next
five
10
steps
steps
end
next
step
And
continue
breathing
eyes
closed
Just
let
attention
start
focus
back
voice
Our
judgments
stories
tell
situation
tend
exaggerate
feelings
unease
anxiety
stress
They
skew
's
actually
going
proportion
block
us
seeing
truth
situation
allowing
ease
comfort
desire
So
next
time
're
feeling
anxious
remember
breathe
notice
acknowledge
judgements
story
behind
And
let
drop
away
notice
anxiousness
eases
Focus
truth

You

Now

Last

Saybrook
University
Mindfulness
Moment
I
'm
glad
So
time
're
together
I
invite
get
cozy
'll
spending
time
inquiry
So
maybe
would
like
grab
journal
notebook
feels
right
If
's
okay
Just
simply
arriving
engaging
experience
Just
holding
meditation
mind
's
eye
bathing
response
So
settle
maybe
grabbing
journal
Maybe
pen
pencil
We
'll
preface
experience
So
tomorrow
're
experiencing
full
moon
I
often
like
reflect
Spend
time
reflecting
around
means
also
us
collective
So
's
certain
energy
comes
full
moon
every
full
moon
're
shifting
one
moon
cycle
next
Here
moving
Spring
We
're
really
shedding
days
Winter
're
growing
Spring
We
see
growth
happening
around
us
's
real
core
energy
comes
time
year
I
think
So
one
calls
us
find
balance
create
harmony
attend
relationships
So
also
means
attending
acknowledging
relationship
disharmony
So
noticing
relate
people
How
relate
community
recognizing
differences
defensiveness
versus
receptivity
How
moving
life
How
moving
change
life
Is
pushing
fighting
burning
self
maybe
I
'd
like
think
periods
go
shedding
We
shed
kind
releasing
old
patterns
thinking
behaviors
longer
serve
us
Kind
move
growth
edge
So
I
'd
like
continue
begin
really
consider
shedding
longer
serves
How
way
holds
deeply
Kind
allows
move
change
discomfort
dignity
self-respect
clearly
see
opportunities
growth
Profound
growth
So
however
would
like
right
I
'll
drop
questions
awareness
hold
silent
space
explore
journal
writing
feel
like
want
sit
still
awareness
So
however
would
like
right
perfectly
fine
Again
calling
back
thinking
shedding
What
letting
go
right
moving
towards
growth
edge
So
let
go
parts
things
want
hold
So
question
really
I
want
sit
characteristics
love
want
every
version
So
I
'll
say
What
characteristics
love
want
every
version
I
'll
hold
space
move
dialoguing
sitting
body
mind
So
maybe
jotting
even
considering
aspects
qualities
characteristics
really
make
YOU
Shifting
I
'll
drop
another
question
silently
consider
express
onto
page
skins
I
shedding
We
're
talking
letting
go
moving
new
growth
So
skins
shedding
For
example
something
comes
mind
I
'm
shedding
hustle
mentality
This
go-go-go
Westernized
mentality
So
skins
shedding
Just
allowing
bring
awareness
mind
's
eye
Maybe
allowing
words
format
onto
page
Holding
kind
awareness
Acknowledging
shedding
old
skins
's
easy
It
's
easy
resistance
comes
're
metamorphisizing
So
shifting
Shifting
awareness
considering
support
change
support
difficult
times
So
final
question
consider
I
'd
like
drop
ask
I
desire
loved
This
two
part
question
How
I
desire
loved
I
love
way
I
desire
I
'll
say
How
I
desire
loved
First
thinking
How
I
love
way
I
desire
So
allowing
consider
write
anything
else
feels
meaningful
So
begin
bring
inquiry
practice
gentle
close
Just
allowing
really
sit
whatever
meaning
insight
might
come
forth
experience
Taking
feels
important
maybe
closing
eyes
bathing
still
awareness
If
allowing
come
back
space
Refocusing
's
around
Just
acknowledging
others
gathered
experience
Sharing
meditative
space
So
maybe
something
came
feels
important
So
might
choose
speak
place
experience
perhaps
would
like
say
anything
Just
experience
So
might
choose
remain
long
'd
like
sense
presence
Allowing
come
back
together
share
fruit
practice

Namaste
friends
I
’
glad
There
cartoon
came
right
Christmas
The
caption
“
Tree
trauma
”
see
disturbed
Christmas
tree
lying
psychiatrist
's
couch
tree
saying
“
Well
turns
gifts
’
”
And
I
loved
And
I
thought
I
’
share
bit
lead
theme
We
going
exploring
’
called
trauma-sensitive
mindfulness
And
I
’
like
begin
saying
early
days
meditation
practice
uniform
mindfulness
guidance
“
If
something
strong
comes
”
know
“
Lean
fear
”
know
“
Bring
gentle
clear
mindful
attention
whatever
arises.
”
And
worked
pretty
well
But
I
found
later
people
lot
fear
trauma
could
amplify
fear
ways
sometimes
felt
overwhelming
And
people
experienced
panic
stopped
meditating
What
’
understand
calling
“
trauma-sensitive
mindfulness
mindfulness
needs
adapted
flexibility
sensitivity
care
best
serve
living
PTSD
well
anyone
’
feeling
moment
potentially
overwhelming
emotions
So
talk
want
deepen
understanding
territory
I
’
like
encourage
read
David
Treleaven
’
book
“
Trauma-sensitive
therapy
”
’
resources
website
So
’
discuss
PTSD
strong
fear
arises
may
times
really
’
wise
lean
And
way
illustration
Peter
Levine
leader
responding
trauma
uses
Medusa
myth
illustrate
know
Medusa
monster
venomous
snake
hair
anyone
looks
face
immobilized
know
freeze
turn

So
Perseus
Greek
hero
advised
Athena
–
goddess
wisdom
tells
look
directly
Medusa
use
shield
way
reflect
gaze
allow
enter
cave
slay
demon
So
point
sometimes
directly
face
contact
suffering
times
need
actually
shift
attention
case
meditation
need
find
ways
soothing
sympathetic
nervous
system
know
self-soothing
’
activated
words
need
learn
nurture
So
’
going
return
But
I
want
name
talk
really
us
many
experienced
trauma
experience
times
emotionally
overwhelmed
feels
like
’
going
much
need
way
calm
come
back
balance
So
whether
healing
PTSD
less
severe
suffering
wounded
relationship
need
relationship
healing
crucial
part
relationship
relate
inner
life
domain
meditation
Meditation
really
essential
deep
authentic
healing
And
one
last
times
I
taught
weekend
retreat
life
retreat
I
remember
woman
standing
front
I
think
three-hundred
people
said
“
I
’
decades
PTSD
therapy
And
’
I
introduced
meditation
eight
years
ago
”
said
“
I
finally
found
inner
refuge.
”
I
’
heard
many
people
And
key
thing
share
–
common
theme
–
place
trauma
transforms
gateway
spiritual
healing
wound
becomes
entry
And
might
remember
Lenard
Cohen
saying
“
In
broken
places
light
shines
through.
”
So
trauma
painful
also
place
reconnect
sense
sacred
soul
spirit
sense
fearless
heart
So
I
’
starting
purpose
’
possible
much
painful
emotions
’
extreme
full
trauma
something
’
wish
lives
That
intensity
really
become
domain
spiritual
awakening
learn
pay
attention
So
I
’
seen
–
us
–
practice
mindfulness
needs
customized
And
different
bodies
minds
need
different
days
need
flexibility
work
instructions
’
given
This
especially
true
trauma
And
emphasis
needs
trauma
first
creating
enough
sense
safety
’
possible
really
full
presence
So
’
cover
’
look
background
suffering
trauma
’
look
particular
strategies
help
customize
mindfulness
self-resourcing
really
healing
comes
open
wholeness
So
way
background
trauma
live
know
I
could
ask
hand
raise
“
How
many
either
know
trauma
personally
body-mind
know
someone
close
dealing
trauma
”
Most
everyone
would
raise
hand
trauma
widespread
similarly
PTSD
–
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
–
’
prevalent
collective
psyche
especially
admit
global
poli
crisis
’
’
living
The
writer
Carol
Patterson
describes
us
“
PTSD
society.
”
And
signs
traumatized
society
Disconnection
earth
bodies
violation
earth
cruelty
aggression
towards
fellow
beings
addiction
spread
whole
globe
polarization
fragmentation
breakdown
communication
parts…
These
signs
trauma
And
think
collectively
also
individual
body
And
feels
really
important
recognize
people
non-dominant
groups
face
ongoing
threats
conditions
make
vulnerable
experiencing
trauma
including
generational
trauma
experiencing
And
identities
–
non-dominant
identities
–
include
race
religion
ethnicity
social
class
sexual
orientation
indigenous
heritage
national
origin
gender
disability…
So
many
And
dominant
groups
’
hard
remember
recognize
different
backgrounds
identities
actually
experiencing
And
I
feel
like
Resmaa
Menakem
important
voice
And
uses
language
“
black
bodies
feel
endangered
potentially
traumatized
whites.
”
He
describes
centuries
currently
white
bodies
countless
times
violent
black
bodies
reverse
killing
lynching
raping
And
sharing
white
people
often
forget
much
trauma
Falkner
says
clearly
says
“
The
past
dead
It
even
past.
”
And
means
Situations
white
people
’
register
triggers
trauma
actually
And
I
think
life
meditation
class
I
used
teach
weekly
live
largely

located
fairly
wealthy

would
come

many
anxious

I
’
get

like
“

–

I

They
’
The

It

Another

Those

Not

I
think

’
quite

countries
Pakistan

I
think

This

So
I
took
little
time
huge
trauma
non-dominant
populations

much
around

staggering

And
course
addition
collective
causes
trauma
many
us
go
traumatic

accidents

abuse
sudden
losses…
You
know
two

children
reported

traumatic
event
age

So
difference
trauma

–

–
trauma

overwhelmed
normal
coping
strategies
’
work
PTSD
arises
inability

So
people

And
example
Let
’
say
someone
sexually
abused
young
child
happens
repeatedly
unpredictably
And
severed
belonging
safety
larger
container
trustworthy
available
adult
could
way
make
possible
healing
processing
So
trauma
living
body
“
The
issues

”
say
And
’
easily
triggered
Any
sign
danger
violation
abandonment
activates
acute
stress
And
happens
This
means
parts

chronically
on-button

cortisol

It
damages

And

And
feels
really

announces
“

”
And
son
resists
says
“
I

”
And
says
calmly
–
tries

–
“

”
Inside
increasingly

Again

And

”

Takes

”
And
looks

We

The

put

She

So
I
shared
story
talk
I
gave
–
course
gave
permission
–
talk
many
lined
talk
And
sharings
similar
One
person
put
clearly
said
“
I
’
always
ashamed

relationships
rage
shutting
listening
I
realized

”
And
said
“
I
’
better
way.
”
And
sense
relief
glimmering
self-forgiveness
And
many
something
similar
could
get
best
could
time
sense
hope
possibility
But
needed
forgive
first
I
remember
similar
way
man
I
worked
years
ago
Company
downsized
got

descended
panic

avoided

falling
apart
really
filled
shame
And
I
remember
working
finally
point
saying
“
This
trauma
And
’
fault.
”
And
something
cracked
open
He
started
weeping
It
beginning
self-compassion
beginning
healing
And
gradually
reached
friends
joined
men
’
group
started
reengaging

Trauma

And
starts

And

fairy
–
intelligent

So
I
’
spending

asking

And
I
extend

With
deep

Let

pause
reflect

You
might
consider
might

coping
strategies
work
’
going
inside
–
maybe
dissociating
body
maybe

So
check

Trauma

And
honestly
check

Have

Have

And

And

”
And
helps
might
imagine
someone

”
I
invite

Again
fairy

“

”
If
eyes
closed
might
open
In
many
shamanistic
cultures
process
reconnecting
–
releasing
shame
processing

–
’
called
soul

And
’
believed

protecting

pain
And
process

I
like
description
I
’
heard
many
heal

describe
recovering

recovering
sense
dimensions
sacred
live

And
likewise
healing
contexts
care…
one
’
community
–
care
therapists
friends
teacher
might
initially
provide
safety
reconnect
degree
authentic
presence
well-being
inside
We
need
I
always
think
little
story
’
stormy
night
child
calls
parents
scared
thunder
And
father
goes
says
“
It
’
okay
You
trust
God
you.
”
And
child
little
leaves
room
child
starts
whaling
father
comes
back
reassures
know
“
God
you.
”
And
leaves
room
And
finally
child
crying
comes
back
child
says
“
You
know
I
know
God
I
want
someone
skin
on.
”
So
I
love
need
interpersonal
need
relational
support
healing
trauma

And

And

”
So

As

find

And
bring

taking

natural

Becoming

air
movement
And
movement
chest
Allowing

relaxed
yet
alert
Bringing
awareness
every
part
Your
eyes
Hands
Feet
The
surface
sitting
laying
Every
detail
clear
present
And
find
place
presence
I
share
theme
fearless
In
complex
unpredictable
world
Fear
find
way
mind
many
ways
Fear
making
wrong
decision
Fear
future
Fear
unknown
Healthy
fear
caution
call
Allows
us
make
informed
decisions
To
protect
shield
harm
But
less
healthy
fears
could
Might
clear
resolutions
They
could
situations
unknowns
That
unable
change
They
kinds
fears
’
immediately
bring
proaction
But
instead
take
mind
away
presence
peace
Instead
pushing
away
less
healthy
fears
arise
It
good
right
us
acknowledge
But
allow
set
aside
To
remind
fears
control
us
Or
contentment
And
bring
attention
ideas
Recognizing
differences
Healthy
caution
less
healthy
fear…
Just
continue
focus
natural
breath
In…
Just
allowing
body
become
bit
relaxed
And
mind
bit
present
With
every
breath
in…
And
remembering
bring
focus
relaxation
To
every
part
body
Like
gentle
wave
You
feel
move
top
head
All
way
tips
toes
With
gentle
breath
air
movement
Recognizing
heartbeat
Allow
find
place
stillness
And
I
invite
join
short
phrases
That
serve
reminders
Whether
loud
head
You
repeat
After
phrase
Feeling
word
phrase
deeply
As
hear
Starting
In
every
moment
Aware
fearful
thoughts
Welcoming
fear
Recognizing
fear
Then
setting
fear
aside
Just
Setting
fear
aside
Great
job
It
instinct
run
fear
thoughts
arise
A
thought
fear
control…
Or
fear
something
much
greater
consequence
But
running
We
run
thought
real
fear
And
therefore
become
stuck
loop
exit
We
let
linger
chase
us
cloud
vision
Build
anxiety
This
process
action
setting
fears
aside
Is
useful
tool
And
also
use
anxiety
arise
fear
Welcoming
recognizing
But
allowing
overcome
us
Or
eat
away
us
Only
allowing
process
When
thoughts
cause
useful
action
present
time
Rather
useless
strain
mind
body
And
I
invite
repeat
phrases
But
time
focusing
anxiety
stems
fear
Breathing
gently
Continuing
sit
comfortably
Beginning
In
every
moment…
Aware
anxious
thoughts
Welcoming
anxiety
Recognizing
anxiety
Then
setting
anxiety
aside
Just
Setting
anxiety
aside
Excellent
Sometimes
setting
aside
fear
anxiety
Is
easily
said
done
You
use
techniques
serve
daily
Or
even
minute
minute
reminder
That
many
useless
unhelpful
thoughts
Floating
around
within
minds
We
practice
proactive
Rather
reactive
mind
We
find
peace
When
allow
pull
mind
along
Rather
let
minds
unconsciously
pull
us
And
place
presence
Recognizing
fears
Recognizing
anxiety
If
like
stay

For
next
little
And

I
encourage

With

Continue
