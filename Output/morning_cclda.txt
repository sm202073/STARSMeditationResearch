0 Welcome to our gentle and calm meditation for relaxation and sleep. In this moment right now I want you to find a space to externally and internally disconnect from the outside noise. May we take this opportunity to let go of the day, let go of the idea if t was good or bad and simply fall into the silence and peace within your heart. So let's find a comfortable seated position. You can even sit on your bed in preparation for a deep and restful sleep. Take a deep breath in and exhale out. Rest your hands comfortably on your lap. Close your eyes. Notice how you're feeling right now in this moment. Inhale and exhale. Take this opportunity to let go of the heaviness, the body, the mind. Allow any tension to release out of your face, relax your forehead. Allow your eyes to be heavy, the jaw to be relaxed. Inhale and exhale. There is no more need to hold on to anything anymore. Give yourself the permission to truly surrender to rest, to peace and to the calm and loving energy within you. Inhale and exhale. Let go of your shoulders. Let them fall away, downward, away from your ears. Releasing any heaviness, weight and tension that the world may have brought upon you today. Let it go. Allow your arms to be heavy, soft and relaxed. Feel your heart gently beating with each inhale and exhale, reminding you of the powerful energy that exists within, reminding you of this beautiful life that you have, that you get to experience through all the positive and challenging moments each serving a purpose, to find gratitude, to find strength, peace and acceptance of this magical existence on this earth. Breathe in. Breathe out. With every breath that you take right now open your heart to gratitude, to love, to forgiveness and to this presence within you. You are strong, you are powerful, you are beautiful. You are loved and you are love. Let this idea sit with you as you slowly give yourself permission to relax, to let go of the day, the worries, the uncertainty, digging deeper within yourself to find the true essence of what and who you are, your loving conscious awareness. Inhale and exhale. Notice your breath, notice what comes to you as you begin to let go. Notice any images, colors, shapes or memories that may arise. Without any judgment simply stay aware as you give yourself permission to relax deeper and deeper. Within this present internal awareness begin to visualize yourself melting deeper and deeper into your relaxed state of being, your body getting heavier as you open your heart to the loving energy that you're cultivating from within. Breathe, rest and let go, just let go. Listening to the sound of the rain, let yourself be filled with ease, serenity bliss and deep loving relaxation. Breathe in, breathe out and let go. Breathe in, breathe out. Now as we finish our practice together you are more than welcome to lie down on your bed and use this beautiful energy that you have cultivated from within to guide you into a deep healing and relaxing sleep. If you are not ready for sleep yet simply bring your hands together in Anjali mudra and bow down to your heart to thank yourself for giving yourself this moment of peace, relaxation and healing. May you have a beautiful night. Sleep well. Namast√©

0 thank you so much for joining me today for our meditation practice today we're going to take this time together to simply gift ourselves a moment of stillness and peace and plugging ourselves from the external world of action and constant movement and giving ourselves this opportunity right now to go within so find a comfortable place to sit down or even lay down if you need to just be careful that you do not fall asleep if you're seated place your hands on your knees and Jana or chin mudra where you connect the thumb and index finger or simply have your palms open resting comfortably on your knees take a long inhale feeling that oxygen entering your body and then slowly release everything with your gentle and calming exhalation give yourself and your mind permission to settle in this present moment feel your body in whatever position it is grounded centered and relaxed I understand the mind might find it really difficult right now to turn off the thoughts and the worries but know that you are in control of your mind and you are able to simply make a choice right now to pause just pause breathe in and let it go you may be experiencing a lot of uncertainty in your life right now but just know that with every challenge and pain we are faced with in life within those moments is where incredible strength and growth develops within us and in the moment of pain and struggle it may be really difficult to understand that there is something we will take from this that it will help us along this path of human experience but I truly believe that nothing is brought to us without a greater divine purpose of evolving us through this journey of human life so right now as you listen to my voice I want you to simply exhale and let all of that fear and tension melt away out of your body out of your mind out of your being even just for this moment inhale and exhale remember that there is great power within you and that power will guide your way through the storm believe in it believe in yourself and never allow the external circumstances of the outside world diminish that inner flame that burns within you I want you to take another deep breath in and simply relax everything is going to be okay take another deep breath in allowing yourself to settle down even deeper into the stillness that you are experiencing externally and internally at this very moment this stillness is always here within you it is your neutral state of being the state of complete presence and self awareness and now in this presence we are going to come back to our cells connect to our heart to find true peace and love that is within us take another deep breath in and let it go feel the body slowly letting go feel the mind slowly letting go be present and all that you are a beautiful radiant being of light breathe in and - welcome calmness and peace today we are going to repeat a very simple mantra of gratitude this is something you can practice every morning and evening or any time of the day a phrase and mantra that allows your mind to focus on the positive beautiful things around you and even if it is hard for you to find something to be grateful for right now as you may be going through a very difficult time in your life but just remember even giving things for the most simple gifts of life like your breath like having this moment to yourself could be enough to begin to cultivate that beautiful energy from within so as you allow yourself to go deeper within feel free to place your hands in Anjali mudra or some call it the prayer position with the palms of your hands together or you can just keep the hands exactly where they are in here I just want you to repeat a very simple mantra thank you thank you thank you as you begin to say these simple two words try to fully feel it not just saying the words themselves but attaching this energy to the words and turning it into gratitude towards the universe truly feeling it within you and speaking it from your heart thank you for my breath thank you for my strength thank you and allow yourself to finish that sentence with whatever comes through your heart as you repeat this simple mantra and connect deeper to your heart find even the smallest of gifts in your life to be thankful for thank you for the strength to be able to be with myself in this time thank you for the love around me thank you for the support continue to repeat this from your heart feel it find everything that's beautiful in your life that you can give thanks for even if your health is not doing well right now may you give thanks for your strength that you have thank you thank you universe thank you for my body thank you for my mind thank you for my health thank you for the people around me that care for me thank you continue to repeat this and allow your heart to speak it's okay to feel emotions arising if they do just send your love and gratitude out from your heart and watch what comes up and what releases stay here for a moment with yourself surrounded by the energy of gratitude and love [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you now slowly feel free to release your hands back to your knees or keep them wherever is comfortable for you take this opportunity to come back to your breath breathe in and let it go just let it go sit with this feeling within you right now notice how you're feeling do you feel lighter do you feel more calm perhaps a little bit more blissful become aware of this beautiful energy that you have created within you with this simple mantra of gratitude this is such a powerful tool for us to use in everyday life but especially when challenge is brought forward to us because it is in those moments when our mind and ego clings to lack and fear that we must fight to keep our strength and presence through love and gratitude I encourage you to practice this in any moment you find throughout your day whether it is at the end of your practice before bed or in bed when you wake up practice being grateful for the miracles of life that we get to experience every single day each breath each day is a blessing if you choose to see it that way and the choice lies within you feel free to stay where you are in this beautiful peaceful presence or feel free to now slowly begin to open your eyes and simply sit with yourself give yourself time to process everything or simply breathe in total silence and stillness may you be blessed with health with strength and with all the love that you deserve thank you for being here with me on this journey it has been an honor thank you namaste [Music] [Music] [Music]
0 welcome to your perfect morning meditation to still the mind and execute a perfect day the key to this meditation is allowing yourself to let go to let go of all that arises during the next 10 minutes inside your mind and body letting go of emotions that stir thoughts that appear and any physical or mental discomfort that may arise in this day and age it's not easy to surrender to a still mind we are constantly baited into a never-ending habit loop of filling the emptiness with whatever our minds can latch onto but here right now this morning we are going to compassionately take our power back and with our new empowered sense of control we are going to let go of everything so throughout the next 10 minutes anytime anything interrupts your stillness whether you your mind or external sources with forgiveness and empathy in our hearts and a conscious understanding that letting go is the actual exercise so without these distractions coming forward we would have nothing to let go of in the first place so as your thoughts begin to invade the stillness as they always will try to watch them like a cloud as they float in just invite them to leave and as they do without judgment just reground yourself and resettle into the stillness that you're working so effortlessly to cultivate so now find a quiet place with me and let's settle into a few conscious breaths to establish the thread to which we will always return take a deep slow inhale feeling your lungs expand and then hold it just when you have all the air you can for a single moment before steadily releasing the breath through your nostrils with a long exhale only to repeat again slowly over and over finding your natural rhythm of breathing and holding at the peak and then again when completely empty as you breathe try to focus your mind on the air entering and leaving your nostrils and the sensation of your lungs and chest slowly expanding and retracting breathing in slowly holding for that moment and then exhaling out allowing yourself to sink deeper and deeper into this moment as you invite your focused consciousness to reveal itself with each new breath your breath this moment remember whatever arises in you it's perfect because it creates an opportunity for you to release it to let go and find your next breath returning to your focus returning to this moment wherever you are right now knowing that this is exactly where you're supposed to be breathing in slowly perfectly and then holding just for that moment before action and reaction finding that peak feeling exactly how exhilarating it can be and releasing slowly until your lungs are completely empty and pausing there again just long enough to revel in that emptiness that right there is your moment of pure conscious bliss [Music] breathing in deeply slowly perfectly hold and exhale out slowly again allowing it to naturally unfold emptying the lungs and hold then repeat now i'd like to invite you if it makes sense to your practice to add in this mantra for the remainder of our time here today simply whisper these words for the first time after me and then continue in your mind i open myself to today and all that will unfold i open myself to today and all that will unfold i open myself to today and all that will unfold if and when you fall away from this mantra remember that is the exercise so without judgment simply let go of it and return back to your breathing or to this mantra itself [Music] i open myself to today and all that will unfold i open myself to today and all that will unfold i open myself to today and all that will unfold now quietly in your mind [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now slowly coming back to your consciousness to your awareness to you being exactly where you are which is exactly where you need to be i invite you if it feels right and you have the time to pause this video and continue to meditate to sit with your conscious breath or your mantra and be for as long as you see fit but if not slowly and carefully bringing movement back into your fingers and toes you can open your eyes with a smile and let it deep exhale out today you've done something for you you have set the intention consciously to make today the perfect day that you deserve and that is no small feat so thank yourself and i'd like to thank you as well for spending this time with me may today be the best day of your life because that's exactly what you deserve namaste you

0 [Music] welcome to our meditation practice today's intention for our time together is to help the mind find peace and balance especially to help ourselves cope with the uncertainty of our world at this time let us begin today by finding a comfortable seated position you can sit on your bed against the wall or on a comfortable cushion if you have one let's begin by closing our eyes and taking both our hands and placing them upon our heart take a deep breath in and listen to your own heart beating in your chest what each beat may it remind you of this beautiful energy life prana that is within you with each beat may take you deeper within at this time into the internal experience of your own being take a deep breath in through your nose no long exhalation out allowing yourself to find this presence comfort and grounding within you slowly release your hands onto your lap let's take the chin hand mudra where we place the thumb and index finger together allowing the palm of the hand to face upward creating a seal of energy within your body close your eyes and allow yourself to go even deeper focusing your awareness to the space between your eyebrows your third eye simply focus and notice if you begin to see any shapes or colors or perhaps just complete emptiness and blackness no judgment here just simply observe [Music] breathing and let it go allow your body to let go of any tension in your face relaxing your forehead allowing your eyes to feel heavy and clenching your jaw complete relaxation of the face then move this relaxation downward towards your shoulders your arms and then down towards your hips and your legs just let it go simply stay present noticing the movement of your breath as you breathe in and out begin to notice any sensations in your body feeling the coolness of the air coming into your nostrils as you breathe in and then the warmth of the air leaving your nostrils as you breathe out [Music] notice if you begin to feel any tingling sensations in your fingers or your toes whatever you are experiencing right now just simply notice it be the watcher of the experience itself allow yourself to find peace enjoy in this simple moment of silence and disconnection you deserve it [Music] this is a time where it's very normal for our minds to begin to want to cling to something a specific thought a memory a daydream or perhaps even fear or the future it will go in many directions and that's okay simply remember to use your breath whenever you feel yourself drifting away from this present moment use your breath to come back to yourself to this moment right here right now wherever you are take a deep breath in and a long and soft exhale of breathing exhale out in this moment it's okay to realize that you may be feeling uncertainty stress or anxiety in your life but remember it is simply a reaction to the circumstances around you which is creating a future that has not happened yet and won't necessarily happen either even though we may not be able to control what life brings our way at this time what we do have control over is how we react to the challenges or any situations that are brought forward to us so breathe in and in this moment choose to let all that negative energy go release it out of you into the ground into the earth choose to find peace enjoy in the simplicity of this very moment simply being here with yourself giving yourself permission to feel to be to let go breathe in and exhale out [Music] as you begin to take your deep breaths I want you to see and visualize a beautiful radiant white light around you it can be crystal white or with a tint of any color that comes to you see this beautiful light of love entering your body with each breath welcome this light through the crown of your head and downward into every fiber and cell of your body visualize this radiant light healing your body in all the ways that you need healing at this moment making you stronger grounded and healthy with your exhalation begin to visualize this darker gray murky color leaving your body so inhale beautiful radiant white light and exhale dark gray energy out of your body create this beautiful intention to let go of all that no longer serves you and emotions unnecessary thoughts exhale them out of your body your mind and your inner being inhale radiant light exhale all the weight off your shoulders inhale next sale [Music] now as we continue to go deeper and dive further into our inner exploration let's come back to that third eye chakra or the center between your two eyebrows notice how you feel right now don't let your mind win the ego may get in the way making you doubt yourself make you want to stop but simply pay no attention to that energy notice it be aware of it and then take a breath and confirm to yourself that you are in control of your peace your happiness and your well-being take another deep breath in exhale as you let it go as you're allowing yourself to

A welcome reprieve from¬†¬† the many thoughts and decisions running¬† through your mind throughout each day. It is good to remember that we are¬† often more than the roadblocks that¬†¬† sometimes come up in our minds. And we¬† can break through them. You got this. To get us settled into focusing on our breath,¬† I encourage you to continue taking comfortable¬†¬† and natural breaths. Let it¬† flow comfortably and naturally¬†¬† again focusing on your breath in and out.¬†¬† I invite you to take this opportunity¬† to calm your mind and relax your body. Just repeat these short¬† affirmation phrases in your head. With this next breath cycle... I relax my eyes. With this next breath cycle... I relax my shoulders. With this next breath cycle... I relax my arms. With this next breath cycle... I relax my legs. And with this next breath cycle... I relax my entire body. As you remain here in this comfortable space,¬†¬† continue that awareness of your breath,¬† your body, the space that you are in. You can focus your gaze gently on a space¬† across the room... or allow your eyes to close.¬†¬† Just remaining alert yet¬† content throughout this time. Feeling that breath flow through your nostrils...¬† muscles relaxed... present and at peace. We all face challenges day in and day out.¬†¬† And you are ambitions. Driven. You¬† have high expectations for yourself.¬†¬† And sometimes, maybe even subconsciously¬† in your mind... you may doubt yourself. Something may seem too¬† challenging... too difficult.¬†¬† You come across a roadblock and feel¬† as though you just can't get past it. This is when we remind ourselves of the simple¬† phrase that brings us back to the present moment.¬†¬† That helps us to remember¬† what we are truly capable of. I. Got. This. I. GOT THIS. And the challenge that we face¬†¬† is how we take on these ambitious tasks and¬† goals that we have laid out in front of us.¬†¬† And yet, be at peace moment to moment and¬† see a clear path laid out for ourselves. We will now do an affirmation¬† exercise to reshape our thought cycle¬†¬† and begin to more clearly define the path forward. So, in this exercise, repeat after¬† me, either out loud or in your head.¬†¬† And we will use visualization techniques to shape¬† our thoughts... to take us to another place.¬†¬† We begin now: A clear blue lake. A warm sun overhead. Birds in the sky. A sandy beach. I take a step.. Enjoying the process. One foot in front of the next. All in a row. No worry. No fear. Just each. next. step. Just each... next... step. Great. Isn't it wonderful how we¬† can reshape our patterns of thought?¬†¬† We can so easily get lost in the stresses and¬† anxiety. And yet, we realize that we can so¬†¬† quickly bring it back. We can learn to think in¬† steps just like on the sandy and sunny beach. Placing one foot in front of the¬† other and enjoying each step. And if we sometimes forget...¬†¬† we remember that there is always a next step,¬† and it can be a peaceful, enjoyable step. We can learn to love and enjoy the process and¬† remind ourselves of this whenever we become lost. And so, for one last very short affirmation¬† cycle... in a moment you will repeat after me¬†¬† and remember that you are brilliant.¬† You are kind. You are capable. And anytime you need to remind yourself of this,¬†¬† just return back to the beach. The¬† waves. The warm sun. And take a step. So now... Just repeat these short phrases: I am strong. I am enough. I can do this. I... got this.

friend or family member if they are doing okay do we ask for help when we need it this session will help us to bring ourselves into the present moment and understand the power of meaningful communication with those we love and care about it is about listening in a real and true way it's letting our own mind step out of the way in learning to understand the ones we care about more deeply

0 This is a guided mindfulness meditation about caring for yourself and going easy on yourself. The focus of this session is to bring attention to the amount of pressure that we often put on ourselves. We will come to realize that although it can be healthy to hold ourselves to a high standard, we can raise awareness that unnecessarily beating ourselves up can deteriorate our mental state. Allow yourself to sit comfortably, yet alert. Take this time to bring an awareness to your body and to your breathing. Just take calming and gentle breaths, in and out. And begin to enjoy being in the present moment. You can let go of any ruminations about the past and any worries about the future. Continuing to breathe gently and naturally, feel that air movement in and out of your nostrils. And that gentle movement of your chest, as you relax all throughout your body. Especially relaxing your neck and shoulders. Letting the tension out of your arms and legs. Just letting your body sink into the surface that you are in. As you find this place of peace and comfort, I am going to pose several questions. That will give you about 30 seconds to think about that question and see what answers come to your mind. These are questions and suggestions that you can ask yourself throughout each day. The first is: "Is there something in particular that you are currently challenging yourself with, that may be causing your anxiety or stress?" "What thoughts or emotions arise when you become stressed about challenging situations? Are there any mental cycles that you hope to break?" And as the third question, "Are there any certain symptoms that you notice when you think about having stress and anxiety? Do you catch certain thoughts that cause that anxiety and stress?" Great. And again, take these thoughts with you and take the time to occasionally as yourself them during each day. This will help you recognize the source of anxiety and stress and will help you to better manage it as you face those challenges throughout each day. Now, we will take the time to repeat some short mantras. With each short phrase, feel free to repeat it either out loud or just in your head. As a reminder, continuing to sit comfortably, stay grounded in the present moment, just focused on your breath and my voice. Breath and voice. As your body stays loose and comfortable. And we will begin these mantras now. "I am a strong person." "I am thoughtful and kind." "I deserve to love myself." "I deserve to forgive myself." "I deserve joy." "I deserve peace." "I deserve a still and contented mind." Let these ideas sink in deeply, and enjoy them. We will go through them just once more. And again, feel them deeply. Feel them even more profoundly. Let these mantras be at the forefront of your mind as you go into the coming days. I will begin a modified version of these mantras now. "Remembering my strength." "Remembering my thoughtfulness and kindness." "Remembering to love myself." "Remembering to forgive myself." "Remembering to feel joy." "Remembering to feel at peace." "Remembering to keep a still and contented mind." Awesome. Take this with you today and throughout the weeks to come. There will be just a few more minutes of ambient music, so allow yourself to either end this meditation now, or gently feel yourself come back and be ready for the next step in your day or night. Thank you for spending this time with me. That will end the spoken portion of this meditation, now.
0 [Music] [Music] [Music] guided mindfulness meditation unacceptance been letting go allow yourself this time to find a comforting balance and centeredness within yourself find a comfortable spot where you can bring focus to your attention for these few minutes began breathing gently in and out as you start to take notice of your pattern of breathing just allow your arms and legs to release any tension just let gravity hold them gently downward feel that gentle breath in endowed [Music] you're just moving up and down slowly and comfortably and on the next slope breath just let your limbs relax even further releasing any of that remaining tension during this time you may become especially aware of your senses the feeling of the surfaces you're touching against the amount of light in the room and you will hear detailed sounds that may have otherwise gone unnoticed and all of these are fine just allow yourself to experience these sensations and accept them without judgement breathing gently in and out sitting comfortably just take a moment to find the centered feeling of the present moment [Music] and as you become increasingly aware and increasingly centered you are now open to contemplate the topic of this meditation you continuing to gently breathe to raise your awareness to feel the space around you you'll focus on this concept of accepting and letting go take a moment and imagine an incident long in the past that gives you regret something that pops into your minds fairly often maybe you said something wrong maybe you hurt somebody's feelings maybe you felt embarrassed by something you did whatever it was think about the amount of time that you have spent thinking back on that time when you look at it in this context doesn't it seem like a waste of our energy doesn't it seem unnecessary what does it accomplish for us to relive these moments in the past the answer is often nothing of course it is always good to be conscious of our mistakes and make situations right when we must but what we also must learn is how to recognize the beneficial awareness while discarding the useless regret and anxiety that only serves to make us feel bad without resolving anything as you remain focused on this skull let us continue to deepen our understanding by maintaining our awareness on my voice and your breath and the space around you slowly gently in and out we can learn to accept by living in the present moment we can learn to let go by living in there now you can also take this knowledge as it pertains to someone who may have done you wrong in the same way as you think about how your mind reacts to your own mistakes use this presence and centeredness to see a clearer picture of those who you feel have wronged you [Music] and this will help you to forge a clearer path of how to resolve the situation and again mitigate the thoughts that provide no solution and take your mental energy away from peace [Music] and as we continue to focus gently breathing we will do a slow countdown and I'll ask you to repeat these phrases after me either out loud or in your mind gently and easily starting with five awareness of my thoughts for awareness of the present moment three letting go of regret two forgiving others one acceptance [Music] continue to remain focused and deeply peaceful as we count to home once more five awareness of my thoughts for awareness of the present moment three letting go of regrets [Music] to forgiving others [Music] one acceptance [Music] being aware that the past is the past in the future is only an idea of what is to come we can take problems step by step resolving them with a calm and focused approach [Music] focus on the present moment and learn acceptance and letting go [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
0 This is a guided mindfulness¬† meditation on living for today. Feel free to find a comfortable place to sit, and just find your own calming¬† space to be in for a little while. And as you get comfortable, just bring your focus to your breathing, in and out. Just gently and naturally. Allow yourself to feel a¬† sense of calm wash over you. Right here in your place. Here in your time. And I'll just do a slow countdown now, continuing to focus on that gentle natural and relaxed breath. Counting now: Five. Four Three. Two. One. And as you deeply feel this calm and presence, I invite you to imagine your childhood. Think of a feeling like when you would play outside with friends. Fun, free, excited. As we grow up, we know that¬† our lives become busier, more responsibilities, more expectations. More stress to weigh us down. We may long for that¬† childhood-like wonder of youth. As we can so often fall into the¬† trap of worrying about the future and dwelling on the past. With so much to do, we may feel that there is no time¬† to live in the present moment. But of course, this is the trick of the mind that¬† so easily allows us to get lost. But knowing the path back to the present moment can allow us to become found again. We have within each of us¬† the ability to live for today right here and now. Enjoying and taking in each moment. Grateful and willing to embrace¬† this time in this place. And, in learning this, we can realize that this¬† moment, right here and now, is truly all we ever have. And it is truly beautiful to¬† be right here, each moment. And therefore, we can practice and learn the¬† true meaning of living for today. It is the ability to maintain a¬† balance of our responsibilities, while still always recognizing¬† and living right here in the now. It's also reminding ourselves to bring ourselves back, should we get¬† lost, distracted, fearful, or overwhelmed. And so, now, we will deepen our thoughts¬† of presence and mindfulness of living for today by doing some short affirmations. And so if you like, you can repeat these, either out loud or in your head. As I remind you to continue sitting comfortably, breathing naturally with that breath focus. We will start now. "In this moment." "I feel presence and peace." "In this moment." "I feel childlike wonder." "In this moment." "Content and grateful." "In this moment." "Living for each day." Great. And now we will do the same exercise, but this time, focusing on the days to come. So we will start again, now. "Each day, I will remember." "Presence and peace." "Each day, I will embrace." "Childlike wonder." "Each day, I will be. "Content and grateful." "Each day, I will live." "A rich and joyful life." Very nice. Even through challenges, we can embrace and live a rich and joyful life. Keep this in your mind and in your heart. Remember to be present and free, just as you would as a child, running outside, without a care in the world. As a child, you didn't need to strive for it. The process of letting go of all of¬† that baggage of the mind just happened. And it can happen to you again. Feel this deeply within you, and come back to these ideas¬† any day or time that you like. Whenever you need a reminder. Remembering each moment. Present, peaceful, grateful, joyful. Living for today. Now you can continue with¬† silent meditation if you wish, for a while longer. So now, I'll just count down with you once more, starting with: Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
0 This is a guided mindfulness meditation on making a fresh start. There are times in all of our lives when we could use a reset button. ...A way to help ourselves¬† move beyond mental barriers and move forward with a renewed perspective. Starting fresh can allow us to approach challenges with confidence and fearlessness. It allows us to see with¬† clarity, purpose, and positivity. Take a moment to sit comfortably either cross-legged on the ground, or maybe upright in a chair. And wherever you are at, keep¬† your shoulders gently pulled back and your spine straight. Let your gaze soften or allow your eyes to close. Take a few deep breaths in... and out. Allow yourself to fully relax and let go of any tension in your body. As you breathe gently, feel the relaxation flow from your head... downward through your body.... and all the way to your toes. Just remain alert, focused, yet very relaxed. And continuing to breathe¬† naturally and comfortably, on your next breath, as you exhale, imagine that you are releasing¬† any negative feelings or thoughts that are weighing you down. This is a time to let go of the past and become fully present. Embracing what is right here... right now. Remembering that we are always here in the now. In this present moment. So, as you continue that¬† comfortable and natural breathing, and remain focused in this presence, Imagine yourself filling up with a¬† sense of possibility and potential. With each exhale, let go of any doubts¬† or worries that may be holding you back. Think about what a fresh start means to you. Maybe it's a chance to set new goals... To try something new.... to challenge yourself... to let go of the past or to start fresh in a new environment. Whatever it is, allow yourself¬† to fully embrace this opportunity to find ways to start fresh. Imagine that you are standing¬† at the edge of a new beginning. The past is behind you and the¬† future is open and full of potential. What do you want to achieve or accomplish? How do you want to feel as you¬† embark on this new journey? For¬†¬† the next 30 seconds or so,¬†¬† take a moment to visualize what¬† this fresh start looks like for you. and if you can't see it clearly yet,¬† simply enjoy being here in the present and maintaining that clarity and focus. Starting that little bit of time.... now. Fantastic. Allow yourself to feel that sense¬† of excitement and possibility. Know that you have the power¬† to create the life you want... and that a fresh start is always possible. Remember that no matter what¬† challenges may come your way, You have the strength and¬† resilience to overcome them. Trust in yourself and your ability¬† to create the life you desire. Breathe easy, allowing yourself to let¬† go of any remaining doubts or fears. Remember that YOU are in control of your journey. Feeling grounded and energized¬† for this fresh start. Thank you for joining me today. I will now leave you with several¬† minutes of ambient background music to finish up for today.

0 This is a guided mindfulness meditation on being thankful every day. No matter what is happening in life that we may qualify as good or bad... lucky or unlucky... one thing we can know for sure is that we are here and able to experience each day with a fresh new vision each morning that we wake up. This session will remind us of this an emphasize that having a¬† thankful and appreciative heart will allow us to find a renewed¬† peace and stillness within our minds. It will also help us to send¬† positive feelings outward creating an added grace and¬† deeper understanding of others throughout our interactions each day. As we begin, allow yourself to¬† settle into a comfortable position keeping the back straight and the spine extended Envision your body as being¬† relaxed, yet alert and aware not allowing yourself to slouch or drift off. This is a time for a renewing focus of energy bringing yourself here into the present and enjoying the clarity and¬† openness of the mind that it brings. And so, just breathe gently and naturally just as you were before I drew¬† your focus to your breath. You can use the air movement¬† in and out of your nostrils so naturally... as a point of focus. Reminding you of the constant¬† cycle of your breath movement. Again, just remain comfortable and alert. Tuned in to your breath. Your body.¬† And, the words of this session. As you comfortably settle into this¬† presence, we will do a short countdown. Feel free to repeat these short phrases after me. Either out loud or in your head,¬† if you feel comfortable doing so. Starting now: 5: Peace and presence 4: Becoming the watcher 3: Energy in this space 2: Energy into the universe 1: Here and now Here... and now. Wonderful job. And what do I mean by... becoming the watcher? Well, you may enjoy imagining¬† yourself where you are within the space of your room. And when you become the watcher, you see yourself from another perspective at another point in space. And as you visualize yourself within that space, you feel the energy of your body and you can even imagine a warm glow¬† start to form all around you as you watch. You are the life and energy within this space. And that energy extends out of the room... out into the sky... into space... and out into the entire universe. Continue to enjoy those thoughts and this presence keeping that relaxing breath focus and presence. Just take it in, enjoy it. Remind yourself that this is your time. Your perfect place. And now... we bring our¬† attention to being thankful. With all the possibilities that each day brings, the challenges... the problems... It can become easy to feel out of¬† balance with the world around us. and feel as if we are a victim of¬† our circumstances, however small. If we're not careful, we can unconsciously¬† let our minds drift in to loops of negativity. And yet, thankfulness can be a reminder. Waking up each day with a thankful heart can remind us that our obstacles are minor compared to the knowledge that¬† each day is a new opportunity a renewed purpose. Each day is filled with possibility. Mistakes can be mended and new relationships can be built. And even in the most challenging of times... thankfulness allows us to remind ourselves that we are strong. that we can get though. that this, too, shall pass. Being thankful each day can lift us up and put a sense of love into our hearts. We become grateful without¬† the need to pay mind to it. Our appreciation simply begins to exist underneath the surface. An undercurrent of joy, rather¬† than anxiety or negativity. And so, with this in mind... I invite you to open your heart and mind as we repeat a series of affirmations. I remind you that you remain here in the now. In your comfortable space... In your time... Breath and body in rhythm. Ready to welcome these thoughts. And so again, I invite you¬† to repeat each affirmation either out loud or in your head, if you wish. And we will begin... now. Here and now... I remember to be thankful. Here and now... I greet each day with possibility. Here and now... I send love outward. With each day... A renewed strength of mind. With each day... A peaceful presence. With each day... A thankful heart. Great. Just take a moment to reflect on these ideas. Enjoying this space... and enjoying this time. And when my talking ends, and there's just background music... You can reflect and further¬† meditate on these ideas of the possibility of each day. Sending love outward remembering your strength of mind, your peaceful presence, and your thankful heart. You can use this to go forward¬† into each and every day... allowing you to wake up each¬† morning with that thankful heart and a focused mind. You will be ready for positivity and productivity. Taking in and enjoying each moment... even during challenging times. Or having the knowledge that you¬† have the strength to make it through. Remember that thankfulness helps¬† us to see a clear path forward and truly cherish all that we have. And we remember that waking up to each day, in itself, is a blessing and a chance for new possibility. And so now... if you wish to continue on with reflective¬† meditation and the background music I will just count you down. Starting with... 5... 4.... 3.... 2... 1... Thankful every day.

0 allow yourself this time to find a comforting¬† balance and centeredness within yourself find a comfortable spot where you can¬† bring focus and attention for this time begin by breathing gently in and out as you start to take notice¬† of your pattern of breathing just allow your arms and legs to release any¬† tension let gravity pull them gently downward continue to feel that gentle breath in and out¬†¬† and again bring your focus and attention to it your chest moving up and down slowly and comfortably and on your next breath as you breathe out just let¬† your limbs relax even further releasing any of that remaining tension during this time you may become¬† especially aware of your senses.¬†¬† the feeling of the surfaces you're touching¬† against the amount of light in the room you may hear detailed sounds that may have¬† otherwise gone unnoticed and all of these are fine just allow yourself to experience¬† these and accept them without judgment just take that time to find the¬† centered feeling of the present moment as you become increasingly¬† aware and increasingly centered you will become open to contemplate our¬† topic of focus for today being the boundless finding acceptance and being your best self What does it mean to become the boundless? It¬† means to unlock what we already have within us¬†¬† it is to find acceptance within¬† ourself and with our surroundings¬†¬† and ultimately it is to make way¬† for our best self to shine through. we will now do five short affirmations or¬† short phrases which you can repeat after me¬†¬† either out loud or in your head and then we'll¬† take a moment of silent contemplation to reflect¬†¬† let's try this now repeating after me and¬† allowing yourself to become more and more present¬†¬† here in this moment as we count Five: I welcome this moment Four: I become present Three: I open my heart and mind Two: becoming my best self One: becoming the boundless when we talk about being present, it does not mean¬† that we cannot actively learn from our past and¬†¬† future it means that we avoid the unconscious¬† clutter and noise that fogs our true path looking forward actually means being present¬† but with a purpose just as when we are walking¬†¬† we understand that each foot is placed one in¬† front of the other with a clarity of purpose¬†¬† of being successful through that clarity of mind¬† cutting through the noise of our unconscious mind. And so, with these ideas present we once again¬† count using our affirmations starting now.

0 make sure that you're sitting comfortably in whatever position suits you you may wish to close your eyes right now or leave them focused on something for a bit before you allow them to close in these next few minutes of meditation this is your time to simply be to be reminded of the radiant energy of life in you and in all things there is great joy in life there is deep profound joy in simply being as you allow your mind to focus on my voice turn your attention to your breathing you don't have to change how you breathe just focus on it as it happens feel the air gently enter through your nostrils and calmly escape as you exhale for every moment in every day of your life you are continuously breathing in and out this cycle this ritual is one of the purest essences of your life yet how rarely you think on it now feel your belly gently rise and fall and the air continues to flow ever so gently and endowed becoming increasingly present in this moment as you do this you may notice a thought into your mind perhaps it's about something that happened to you recently or maybe a reminder about something you must do before the end of the day whenever you sense one of these thoughts it's okay recognize it but don't follow it any further once you gently process the thought let your attention calmly return to your breathing don't get frustrated with yourself when thoughts keep popping up in your mind simply let them be as they are and continue to calmly redirect your attention as you let yourself become relaxed and comfortable as you continue this enjoyable process the air gently moving through your lungs turn your attention to your body think about where your fingertips are right now even if you do not move them you can sense them in space now envision your toes you may feel a slight tingle as you direct your attention to them now focus on your eyelids they may feel heavy relaxed realize how good it feels to let your eyes sit ever so gently closed as your breath continues to calmly flow in and out now the next time you take a breath when you exhale imagine a warm wave of relaxation flowing from the top of your head down to the tips of your toes did you notice that tingling sensation throughout your body isn't it an amazing sense to bring to your own being without even a single movement every few breaths when it feels right to you try the same process slowly exhaling and feeling a warm gentle wave of relaxation flow slowly from your head to your toes have you noticed any tension that you weren't previously aware of maybe you're holding some in your shoulders but your jaw the next time you send that calming wave through your body let any tense muscles just let go then relax and each time you think of this imagine a doubling of your relaxation as the wave slowly moves down your body you can do it you maybe realizing just how simple this process is yet how greatly it's calming your nerves to realize yourself is the most profound thing you can do yet we so often forget to pay attention but not now now is your time to be in the moment now is your time to be Joey you are capable of feeling intense wonderful profound joy right now you may feel joy in thinking about certain moments in the past but there is no joy in the past because the past is not real it's merely a memory but you are experiencing it in the present there is also no joy in the future because the future is not real it is only anticipation which can itself be joy but you are experiencing it in the present there can only be joy in this moment right now and it can't be yours feel the present joy that exists within you it is a joy to breathe take a breath to focus on this thought in that one breath say it to yourself it is a joy to breathe with subsequent breaths repeat these mantras to yourself I am alive it is a joy to be alive I have a beating heart it is a joy to have a beating heart I can feel the energy in my body it is a joy to feel this energy now fill in more breaths with your own joys take a moment to think on it and then say them to yourself in these next few moments now that you are in the serene state let yourself simply continue to enjoy each moment as you continue to feel the air slowly move through your nostrils and fill your lungs you let go of desire and simply enjoy this moment here and now feel the joy within you in the space you're in in the ones you love feel the joy in all things let yourself be here now you you
0 [Music] it's been an incredible day a mixture you know and I think in many ways that sums up most of our days right it's um it's always a mixture of things but I thought be a nice way to end the day just with with a meditation a short meditation by the fire and whether you choose to keep your eyes open or eyes closed the thing I'd really like you to focus on then I'm gonna focus on is the sound of the fire so we're gonna use that sound as our as our object of meditation if that feels too abstract feels too strange you can always come back to the to the breath but we're gonna just rest our attention in that crackling sound with the fire something really relaxing about it there's nothing to do the fire does the job for us all we have to do is just realize when the minds wandered off and come back and rest in that crackle of the fire so just take a moment make sure you're is sitting comfortably in join me for a little meditation by the campfire so once you're sitting comfortably just gonna have the fire as your as your sort of focal focal point if you're watching this but you're still aware of the space either side the rock below the sky above but it's almost as though the dancing flames they they don't allow the mind to be all the attention to be fixed in one place the mind naturally is encouraged to widen to soften to relax and then just taking a deep breath in through the nose breathing in the fresh air and as you breathe out just letting go of the day do that again another couple of times each time just a sense of letting go and with the next out breath you can either gently soften the focus back on the fire or just gently close the eyes perhaps a sense of putting down any baggage from the day is failing the weight of the body I'm just settling into that sound the wind the flames the crackling wood maybe you can hear the water in the lake which is getting comfortable in this space now as you check in with the body this edges a sense of leaving behind any tension from the day Center any thoughts being left behind it's very briefly noticing the breath and then just settling the attention the focus on the fire you can do this is a visual exercise it was softening the focus each time coming back to the dance of the flames or you can use the sound of the wind sound of the flame crackling of the wood is your point of focus and the fires creating the object of focus for us there's nothing for us to do each time we realized the minds wondered of [Music] as you focus on that sound or on the image of the fire maybe even remembering a time when you'd be next to a fire remembering the smell of the wood sensor you're sitting right here we're sitting right here together the sound of the lake behind us and the flames just constantly moving just creating that space in the mind just staying without for a few moments more and then as you resting that sound is you look at that image just letting the mind do whatever it wants to do now just allowing the mind to be completely free maintaining the soft focus if the eyes are open if they're not just gently opening the eyes and coming back to as soft gaze the fire in front coming back to that feeling of white in contact at the body it's a surface beneath you enjoying a sense of relief having let go the body in the mind I'm going to bed hopefully feeling a little more rested a little more at ease and whenever you're ready just blinking a few times just refocusing the eyes going back to fire I throw the space around you and thank you for joining me by the campfire tonight it's I feel like in just in a few minutes that we've been sat here through somehow transitioned from daytime in tonight it's a good way to end the day      
0 [Music] this is a brief guided mindfulness meditation on living each day as i often suggest in these sessions find a comfortable position to sit or lay [Music] keeping alert and present just focusing on the sound of my voice [Music] and taking gentle natural breaths focusing on that airflow in and out how are you are you tired stressed relaxed anxious whatever you feel right now it is okay allow yourself to feel it and not run from it just settle in and continue those natural comfortable breaths keep that focus on the sound of my voice and continue to allow yourself to give in to the present moment right now you have no regrets about the past and no worries about the future [Music] just right here right now hearing the words i am sharing with you breathing in and out present mindful relaxed what does it mean to say live each day i think it means to open your heart and mind to the possibility of each day every time you wake up and catching yourself at various moments throughout each day when you stray away from that peace and joy within the present moment allowing your minds to fight through the daily distractions there will be times in our lives where there will be difficulties and challenges of course and living each day does not mean that you must force yourself to feel a certain way you can and may be sad about a loss or about something larger going on in the world [Music] but the process of living each day [Music] means to seek something deeper a calm stillness deep within you [Music] like a comforting home that you can seek out once you weather each storm we can't always avoid sadness or pain or loss or problems but you can make the conscious choice to keep that place of peace within you always there underneath and you can leave the door open to embrace it a place of stillness and peace always there deep within you [Music] with this in mind we will do a short series of affirmation statements followed by the calming ambient music for a while longer i invite you to repeat these phrases either in your head or say them out loud if you wish [Music] we will begin now [Music] i have strength in mind and body i start each day with positivity i will find a deep sense of peace within me [Music] i will keep a level head through any challenges [Music] i will be mindful in each moment i will live each day [Music] present peaceful and aware that's fantastic so now i'll say each one of these ideas once more but shorter now just to reinforce each one and again feel free to follow along with me starting with strength in mind and body [Music] positivity peace within a level head [Music] mindful in each moment living each day [Music] present peaceful aware [Music] wonderful job let the ambient sound continue and as you do you may wish to think of a favorite memory from your past a favorite vacation destination maybe one you've been to or one you haven't some beautiful part of nature just something that brings you great joy and peace a best friend a pet a loved one just use this as an added point of focus to live with presence to live each day [Music] as you hear the ambient sound allow this message of living each day to permeate deep within you use your chosen thought to feel that sense of peace that will allow you to weather the stormy times in life and you will make your way through with a strong mind thoughtful and aware growing learning and moving forward day by day [Music] moment to moment [Music] the spoken part of this meditation session finishes now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
0 This is a brief meditation on embracing the day. You can use this at the start of your day, or¬† as a reminder at any time throughout your day. I will speak for a bit then we'll let the¬† ambient music slowly bring you back into the day¬†¬† at whatever point you wish. Each day is a new beginning, each day is a reminder of renewal. Each day is a gift and opportunity¬† to be a more fully present person. Make yourself comfortable. You could choose to sit on the¬† ground or upright in a chair or even standing if you like¬†¬† ensure that your back is straight and that¬† you are using good yet relaxed posture. If you like, gently shake¬† out your shoulders and arms¬†¬† as you settle in bring your¬† attention to your breathing. It is that ever-present reminder of¬† being here in the present moment. and right now you can choose to¬† continue breathing gently and naturally¬†¬† but also if you like just take several¬† bigger deep breaths in and out. Feel your muscles relax... Your body releasing tension... Just enjoying this breath focus. And, as you return to natural breathing focus, you may also choose to roll your shoulders a bit. or tilt your head to one side and the other. Of course, always do what feels comfortable and doesn't strain your body. now that we are settled into¬† a state of calming presence I invite you to continue your breath focus, and deeply hear these reminders for your day, whether you're at the start of your day, or somewhere in the middle... Each day is a new beginning. Each day is a reminder of renewal. Each day is a gift and opportunity¬† to be a more fully present person. Any regrets from the past... You can allow them to melt away... like flowing colors leaving your body. And worries about the future if those thoughts are not fully necessary, let them melt away. Let those colors flow, And your energy right here¬† in this place of presence... is like you are a glowing orb¬† full of strength possibility locked into focus Today, and in the days ahead... You will be especially compassionate toward others and especially aware of how you¬† communicate with anyone you encounter. you will be a light upon someone else's day in your daily interactions you¬† will be assertive yet measured you will know the right thing to say¬† or do in most any given situation And continuing to breathe gently... Continuing to stay focused here in the present... I suggest to you that you will show yourself kindness in the same way that you will show it to others. Mistakes may happen, but you will focus on how you recover from them, and not focus on the mistake itself. You will believe in your potential. You will be patient in reaching your goals, but confident in your ability¬† to move closer to them. Embrace the day. Embrace yourself! Give yourself permission to¬† be your biggest supporter. Your own self-care will exude outward... reaching the hearts and minds¬† of all whom you encounter today. And so... be strong. Be well. Stay here in this space and take a¬† few more deep breaths if you like... and then return to your day¬† at whatever point you choose. If you can, take your time. This is your time. this is your space. Live it for a bit longer, and come back¬† whenever you can use this reminder. Embrace the day.

0 [Music] [Music] this is a meditation on controlling negative thoughts we all have times throughout each day that our minds are invaded with negativity whether these thoughts are very upfront or very deep in our subconscious we might feel negatively about small things like a task that's hanging over our heads or larger things like a major life problem there are fears about the future or even the state of our world with all of the potential for stress and worry in our lives it's no wonder that these negative thoughts and emotions can creep in this session will seek to control those intrusive thoughts and bring about a clear and balanced positive outlook on dealing with our daily tasks and seeing a clearer picture of our lives overall you should not attempt to push away and avoid our problems but instead see them with a direct focus in order to deal with them free of burden and over analysis [Music] to begin find a comfortable position wherever you are whether you're seated in a chair on the floor just be sure to find a position that allows you to open up your chest and breathe deeply and comfortably always make sure that you're able to remain fully aware without drifting off to sleep and yet always remain relaxed and at ease you may choose to focus on a point in the room at first or gently let your eyes close begin to consider the rhythm of your breathing as you breathe in now just continue to let it flow naturally and just as you were before your attention turn to it allow yourself to feel your chest and lungs gently rise and fall with each cycle the air moving in and out of your nostrils [Music] and as you continue to do this also just bring your attention to your surroundings evaluate what you sense around you but remain free of any judgement simply observe even if your eyes are closed is it bright or dark in the room are there any extraneous noises the surface that your body is up against hard or soft do you have any aches or pains in your body where do you feel those other any sensations that are especially enjoyable are comfortable at the moment and again as you breathe comfortably and feel your chest rise and fall you are simply bringing awareness to this present moment as you focus your mental energy we realize this moment is really all that exists when a moment is passed this is no longer real and although we do all we can to predict the future that is also not real but just a projection in our anticipation in these moments of focus we can bring more clarity to the realization of the realness of the here and now allow this truth to sink deeply within you continuing to breathe gently in and out aware your sensations and surrounding focused and present now ever so slowly and gently count these five short phrases from 5 to 1 this is repeating after me either out loud or sting your head just repeat them after me starting with 5 I am present for I am aware [Music] three I put the past in the past - I focus on the now [Music] and one I am present [Music] great just feel that wonderful presence something that we so often forget to embrace and enjoy and now let's count down just once more as you do continue to be aware of your surroundings you're just moving in and out any spot that may tingle on your body as it senses the air around it the surfaces that you're up against this is a time that you are given to recognize that you are the one who is fully aware of your thoughts you are in control of your own mind now just count with me eyes I am present Thor I am aware three I put the past in the past [Music] to I focus on the now and one I can present now that you are settled into the state of awareness in control use the following few minutes other shorter or longer to continue to listen to the background music and meditate on your own and practice your recognition of this intrusive thinking just remember that any conjured thought is one that you want to recognize it's not bad or wrong for this to happen when a thought enters your mind but it is good to become immediately aware of the thought and then just brush it aside returning to mental stillness so remember thoughts recognition brush aside and return to stillness [Music] thought Rises you recognize it and you just brush it aside and return back to stillness just continue on as long as you wish till you are ready to finish the session you may want to set a timer or check the color on the video if you so choose or just go as long as it feels comfortable for you or until the music fades out any way you wish to go about it enjoy the remainder of your session and continue unless presence thoughts arise recognition brush the thought aside and return to stillness [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] you

0 Greetings. Namaste friends.¬† I‚Äôm glad to be with you.¬† There was a cartoon that came out right after¬† Christmas. The caption is ‚ÄúTree trauma‚Äù and¬†¬† you see this very disturbed Christmas¬† tree lying on the psychiatrist's couch¬†¬† and the tree is saying, ‚ÄúWell, it turns¬† out that all those gifts weren‚Äôt for me!‚Äù¬†¬† And I loved it. And I thought I‚Äôd share¬† it with you as a bit of a lead in for¬†¬† our theme. We are going to be exploring¬† what‚Äôs called trauma-sensitive mindfulness.¬†¬† And I‚Äôd like to begin by saying that in my¬† early days of meditation practice the uniform¬†¬† mindfulness guidance was ‚ÄúIf something¬† strong comes up, be with it,‚Äù you know,¬†¬† ‚ÄúLean into the fear,‚Äù you know, ‚ÄúBring a gentle,¬† clear, mindful attention to whatever arises.‚Äù¬†¬† And that worked pretty well for me. But I found¬† out later that for people that had a lot of fear,¬†¬† had trauma, it could amplify the fear in ways¬† that sometimes felt overwhelming. And some people¬†¬† experienced panic, some stopped meditating.¬† What we didn‚Äôt understand - what we are¬†¬† calling ‚Äútrauma-sensitive mindfulness - is that¬† mindfulness needs to be adapted with flexibility,¬†¬† with sensitivity, with care to best serve¬† those that are living with PTSD as well as¬†¬† anyone that‚Äôs feeling in the moment potentially¬† overwhelming emotions. So if after this talk¬†¬† you want to deepen your understanding in¬† this territory I‚Äôd like to encourage you¬†¬† to read David Treleaven‚Äôs book ‚ÄúTrauma-sensitive¬† therapy‚Äù and it‚Äôs in my resources on my website.¬† So as we‚Äôll discuss for those with PTSD when¬† strong fear arises there may be times that it¬†¬† really isn‚Äôt wise to lean in. And by way of¬† illustration, Peter Levine who is a leader¬†¬† in responding to trauma uses the Medusa myth to¬† illustrate how, you know, Medusa is this monster¬†¬† with venomous snake hair and anyone who looks in¬† her face will be immobilized, you know, freeze,¬†¬† turn to stone. So Perseus who is the Greek hero¬† is advised by Athena ‚Äì goddess of wisdom - she¬†¬† tells him not to look directly at Medusa, to use¬† his shield as a way to reflect her gaze, and this¬†¬† will allow him to enter her cave and slay the¬† demon. So the point being that sometimes we can¬†¬† directly face and contact suffering but at other¬† times we need to actually shift our attention¬†¬† and in the case of meditation we need to find some¬† ways of soothing our sympathetic nervous system,¬†¬† you know, self-soothing when it‚Äôs activated, in¬† other words we need to learn to nurture ourselves.¬† So we‚Äôre going to return to this. But I want¬† to name that this talk is really for all of us¬†¬† because so many have experienced trauma and most¬† have the experience at times of being emotionally¬†¬† overwhelmed where it just feels like what‚Äôs¬† going on is too much, we need some way to calm¬†¬† ourselves, to come back to balance. So whether¬† we are healing PTSD or a less severe suffering¬†¬† we are wounded in relationship,¬† we need relationship for healing,¬†¬† and a crucial part of relationship¬† is how we relate to our inner life,¬†¬† this is the domain of meditation. Meditation is¬† really essential for all deep, authentic healing.¬† And one of the last times I taught¬† at a weekend retreat, a life retreat,¬†¬† I remember a woman standing up in front of I think¬† there were about three-hundred people and she¬†¬† said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had decades of PTSD and therapy. And¬† it wasn‚Äôt until I was introduced to meditation,¬†¬† and that was eight years ago,‚Äù she said,¬† ‚Äúthat I finally found an inner refuge.‚Äù¬†¬† I‚Äôve heard this from so many people. And¬† the key thing that they share ‚Äì this is the¬†¬† common theme ‚Äì is that the very place of trauma¬† transforms into the gateway for spiritual healing;¬†¬† where the wound is becomes the entry. And some¬† of you might remember Lenard Cohen saying,¬†¬† ‚ÄúIn the broken places the light shines through.‚Äù¬† So trauma as painful as it is also is a place¬† where we can reconnect with a sense of the sacred,¬†¬† soul, spirit, a sense of a fearless heart. So I‚Äôm starting here on purpose with what‚Äôs¬†¬† possible that as much as the painful¬† emotions and when it‚Äôs extreme - full¬†¬† trauma - is something that we don‚Äôt¬† wish for in our lives. That intensity¬†¬† really does become a domain for spiritual¬† awakening when we learn how to pay attention.¬† So what I‚Äôve seen is ‚Äì and this is for all of¬† us ‚Äì that the practice of mindfulness needs to¬†¬† be customized. And we each have different bodies¬† and minds, so we need to - and not just that, on¬†¬† different days - so we need to have a flexibility¬† with how we work with the instructions we‚Äôre¬†¬† given. This is especially true for those with¬† trauma. And the emphasis needs to be with trauma¬†¬† on first creating enough of a sense of safety so¬† that it‚Äôs possible to really have a full presence.¬† So what we‚Äôll cover is we‚Äôll look at some of¬† the background on the suffering of trauma,¬†¬† we‚Äôll look at particular strategies that will help¬† you customize mindfulness and self-resourcing,¬†¬† and really the healing that comes when¬† we can then open to our wholeness.¬† So by way of background on trauma, if we were¬† live, you know, if I could ask you and do a¬†¬† hand raise, ‚ÄúHow many of you either know trauma¬† personally in your own body-mind or know someone¬†¬† close that is dealing with trauma?‚Äù Most¬† everyone would raise their hand because¬†¬† trauma is so widespread and similarly PTSD ‚Äì post¬† traumatic stress disorder ‚Äì it‚Äôs so prevalent¬†¬† in our collective psyche especially admit the¬† global poli crisis‚Äôs that we‚Äôre living through.¬†¬† The writer Carol Patterson describes us as a ‚ÄúPTSD¬† society.‚Äù And the signs of a traumatized society?¬†¬† Disconnection from the earth, from our¬† own bodies, violation of the earth,¬†¬† cruelty and aggression towards fellow beings,¬† the addiction that is so spread through our¬†¬† whole globe, polarization and fragmentation, the¬† breakdown of communication between parts‚Ä¶ These¬†¬† are all signs of trauma. And you can think of¬† it collectively but also in an individual body.¬†¬† And it feels really important to recognize¬† that people in non-dominant groups¬†¬† face ongoing threats and conditions that make¬† them more vulnerable to experiencing trauma¬†¬† including generational trauma, just experiencing¬† that. And these identities ‚Äì non-dominant¬†¬† identities ‚Äì include race, religion, ethnicity,¬† social class, sexual orientation, indigenous¬†¬† heritage, national origin, gender, disability‚Ä¶¬† So many! And if you are in the dominant groups,¬†¬† it‚Äôs very hard to remember and recognize with¬† those with different backgrounds and identities¬†¬† are actually experiencing. And I feel like Resmaa¬† Menakem has been such an important voice for me on¬†¬† this. And he uses the language ‚Äúblack bodies feel¬† endangered and potentially traumatized by whites.‚Äù¬†¬† He describes how through the¬† centuries and currently white bodies¬†¬† are countless times more violent to black bodies¬† than the reverse: killing, lynching, raping.¬†¬† And so as he is sharing white people¬† often forget how much trauma is there.¬†¬† Falkner says it so clearly, he says, ‚ÄúThe¬† past is not dead. It is not even past.‚Äù¬†¬† And what this means is: Situations that white¬† people don‚Äôt register as triggers for trauma¬†¬† actually are. And I think of in my own life the¬† meditation class I used to teach weekly live,¬†¬† largely white attendees, and it was located in¬† a fairly wealthy suburb and my friends of color¬†¬† would come and report they felt intensely¬† uncomfortable, many of them, anxious,¬†¬† you know, and at first I couldn‚Äôt¬† get it, you know, it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúWell,¬†¬† everybody is being really friendly‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs not¬† the deal, I mean, there is the micro aggressions¬†¬† that happen and there is that history of feeling¬† threatened by white people, trauma in the body.¬†¬† They‚Äôre The of course more obvious situation would¬† be being stopped by a police car for speeding:¬†¬† It might be unpleasant for a white person, but¬† for a person of color it can mean life or death.¬†¬† Another whole domain: Those with financial¬† security forget the trauma of poverty,¬†¬† that we are living through these pandemics and¬† how a family when COVID hits a family and you are¬†¬† unable to work and you have several children and¬† that goes on for a bit can put you under the line.¬†¬† Not sure about feeding your family. Paying rent.¬† I think about those in the global north and,¬†¬† you know, we have some climate events that are¬† really disturbing and still don‚Äôt quite recognize¬†¬† that the devastation of climate change really is¬† here now for many countries: Pakistan, one third¬†¬† under water last year Filipinas, Bangladesh;¬† and then I think of the droughts and famine¬†¬† in Africa, Chad, Kenya, Somalia. This¬† is not just livelihood, it‚Äôs life.¬† So I took a little time with that because there¬† is such huge trauma in non-dominant populations¬†¬† and just to realize how much that is around¬† the globe can be staggering to the mind. And¬†¬† then of course in addition to the collective¬† causes of trauma many if not all of us go¬†¬† through traumatic events in our personal¬† life: in the womb, upbringing, accidents,¬†¬† sickness, surgeries, abuse, sudden losses‚Ä¶ You¬† know, more than two thirds of children reported at¬†¬† least one traumatic event by the age of sixteen. So the difference between trauma and PTSD ‚Äì and¬†¬† this is simplified ‚Äì but trauma¬† arises in situations where the¬†¬† nervous system is overwhelmed, where¬† normal coping strategies don‚Äôt work,¬†¬† PTSD arises when there is an inability to¬† process and integrate that trauma into the¬†¬† larger body-mind. So some people will have trauma¬† and process it and not have PTSD and others won‚Äôt.¬†¬† And here is an example: Let‚Äôs say someone is¬† sexually abused as a young child and it happens¬†¬† repeatedly and unpredictably. And so there is¬† that severed belonging, there is no safety, no¬†¬† larger container, no trustworthy available adult¬† who could in some way make possible the healing,¬†¬† the processing. So trauma is living in the body,¬† ‚ÄúThe issues are in the tissues‚Äù as they say. And¬†¬† it‚Äôs easily triggered. Any sign of danger, of¬† violation, of abandonment activates acute stress.¬†¬† And what happens? This means that the parts of¬† our brain that have evolved to monitor for danger¬†¬† are over activated chronically, the on-button is¬† jammed and so there is this regular secretion of¬†¬† cortisol which is toxic for neurons. It damages¬† connections needed for parts of the brain to¬†¬† communicate so it‚Äôs easy for executive function¬† to get cut off, for the limbic fear to take over.¬†¬† I find a useful way to illustrate this is some¬† of you may remember from Dan Siegel where he¬†¬† says you know, this is your brain ‚Äì and you¬† might look at your fist right now ‚Äì this is¬†¬† your brain. And if you look at it close in, this¬† is your limbic system, the spine goes up into the¬†¬† brain stem. This area, the thumb and this area¬† here represent the limbic system and the brain¬†¬† stem which is responsible for the arousal of¬† fight-flight-freeze. And these four fingers,¬†¬† this is the frontal cortex, this is executive¬† functioning, it actually has the capacity to¬†¬† send messages down to the limbic system saying,¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù you know, when there is this thread¬†¬† that comes up the frontal cortex says, ‚ÄúOh we‚Äôve¬† experienced this before, we‚Äôre going to be okay.‚Äù¬†¬† But what happens when we‚Äôre chronically stressed¬† and we don‚Äôt have that kind of integration is we¬†¬† get a message of danger and we flip our lid. And¬† when we flip our lid there is a disconnection¬†¬† from empathy, compassion, perspective, we are no¬† longer functioning with the parts of our brain¬†¬† that give us resourcefulness, we lose access to¬† flexibility, to creativity. So this is the hijack¬†¬† by the survival brain. We‚Äôre essentially¬† unsafe. And it‚Äôs interesting to consider¬†¬† to play, to mate, to create, to nurture our¬† young, to nurture others, to receive nurturing¬†¬† we have to feel safe enough to¬† temporarily turn off our vigilance,¬†¬† shut down our defensive systems, we can‚Äôt¬† have a flipped lid. And yet how often are¬†¬† we partially or fully having that flipped lid¬† reaction and cut off from those capacities,¬†¬† caught in a sense of being small,¬† separate, confused, disconnected.¬†¬† Even when we are not caught in a full flipped¬† lid, we know what a partial hijack is like when¬†¬† our mind becomes preoccupied and small¬† and we‚Äôve lost our sense of perspective,¬†¬† we don‚Äôt have access to our full intelligence, we¬† make more mistakes. One of my favorite examples is¬†¬† of a mom who is generally into feeding her¬† children organic foods and good vegetables. But¬†¬† she wasn‚Äôt able to get to the grocery store, she¬† was stressed, she was tired, and she is looking¬†¬† for what to feed her children. And thank goodness¬† she finds a frozen pizza in the freezer. And she¬†¬† feels really guilty, but she announces, ‚ÄúOkay,¬† we‚Äôre having pizza tonight.‚Äù And her son resists,¬†¬† he says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want frozen pizza!‚Äù And she¬† says very calmly ‚Äì tries to be calm ‚Äì ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs¬†¬† what we‚Äôre having.‚Äù Inside she is increasingly¬† feeling upset because she feels like she is¬†¬† failing them and she feels like a bad mother.¬† And her son is getting upset, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it!¬†¬† I don‚Äôt want a frozen pizza!‚Äù Again, she tries¬† to sound calm, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all we have in the house.¬†¬† You‚Äôve had it before.‚Äù And inside she is thinking¬† ‚ÄúHe is spoiled! I failed him! I am not only a bad¬†¬† mother in terms of good dinners, but I spoiled¬† him, he is an entitled brat! I am a bad mom‚Ä¶,‚Äù¬†¬† you know, just really spinning off. Takes a deep¬† breath, says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôre having tonight,¬†¬† sweetie. I‚Äôm tired. And it‚Äôs what we‚Äôre¬† having.‚Äù And he looks with his tear-streaked¬†¬† voice and he says quite calmly, ‚ÄúOkay,¬† mama, but could we at least heat it up?‚Äù¬†¬† We go into a trance. Partial hijack whether it‚Äôs¬† just a partial flipped lid or a full flipped lid¬†¬† we go into a trance. And as I mentioned when we‚Äôre¬† threatened, when we‚Äôre having that reactivity¬†¬† whether it‚Äôs partial or full flipped lid in those¬† times we are cut off, we are not able to play,¬†¬† learn, bond, take in or give love. And¬† this, friends, is a suffering of trauma,¬†¬† that cut off experience, the fear and mistrust¬† because it‚Äôs really a cut off of belonging to¬†¬† our own being and to others and in a deep way¬† we are cut off from wholeness, from spirit.¬†¬† So bringing this to meditation you might consider¬† that when we are triggered in an intense way, when¬†¬† we are in reactive fight-flight-freeze, we are cut¬† off and outside of our window of tolerance, we are¬†¬† not able to tolerate what‚Äôs arising for us, and¬† that term ‚Äúwindow of tolerance‚Äù again is from Dan¬†¬† Siegel ‚Äì psychologist and author, has been on this¬† podcast ‚Äì and, you know, as he describes it when¬†¬† we are in the window of tolerance our brain is¬† integrated, but when we get triggered and we flip¬†¬† our lid we leave the window of tolerance, we‚Äôre¬† either caught in fight-flight which is strong,¬†¬† unpleasant emotions and when the instructions for¬† mindfulness if we are in fight flight are to feel¬†¬† what‚Äôs going on that‚Äôs when we can have that¬† sense of overwhelm. Or we are in freeze - kind¬†¬† of rigidity, a dissociation - still outside the¬† window of tolerance - numbing, can‚Äôt feel things¬†¬† - and often the instructions for mindfulness are¬† ‚ÄúFeel what‚Äôs going on inside your body‚Äù and yet¬†¬† there is a sense of being cut off. So here is the¬† thing: The classical instructions for meditation¬†¬† tell us to feel our feelings and when we are¬† in fight-flight-freeze we are either feeling¬†¬† them too much - it feels overwhelming - or¬† unable to feel them. And either way there¬†¬† is a sense of in some way not being able to¬† feel the meditation, failing the meditation.¬†¬† And when we are outside the window we¬† are really cut off, we are unable to.¬† So I‚Äôd like to take some moments now to¬† look at the primary suffering that happens¬†¬† when we‚Äôre triggered either into dissociation¬† or triggered into that hyper-sensitivity and¬†¬† strong emotion. And the primary suffering¬† is shame, shame about what‚Äôs going on.¬†¬† And I‚Äôd like to share with you a story some of you¬† might remember that I felt really illustrated the¬†¬† power of traumatic experience and the shame that¬† can surround it and how we can work with that.¬†¬† So many years ago, I was working with this¬† woman who was sexually and physically abused¬†¬† by her father. And as an adult she had¬† an eating disorder, she wasn‚Äôt capable¬†¬† of intimate relationships, and she would swing¬† ‚Äìas I‚Äôve described - between being dissociated¬†¬† from her feelings to being flooded. And she hated¬† herself. She hated herself when she was shut down,¬†¬† she hated herself when she was filled with fear,¬† she hated herself for her body and for her eating¬†¬† disorder, she considered herself damaged goods¬† and hated herself for who she was. This is shame.¬†¬† And she did a good deal of therapy and also was¬† working with meditation and we were customizing¬†¬† it. And out of one intense and deep therapy¬† session she wrote a story about her own healing.¬†¬† And in it she was seven years old, hiding in a¬† closet, terrified after an unexpected attack by¬†¬† her drunk and enraged father. And the little girl¬† in story is praying, she is saying, ‚ÄúHelp, I can‚Äôt¬†¬† take it anymore.‚Äù And she opens her eyes and sees¬† a fairy in a haze of blue with a glittering wand.¬†¬† And she lets the fairy know how her father has¬† been beating her and her mother doesn‚Äôt help and¬†¬† how she feels like they both wish she was dead.¬† And the fairy listens with tears in her eyes and¬†¬† then tells her that while she can‚Äôt make all¬† this pain and fear disappear, she can help her¬†¬† get through this time, she can help her forget and¬† then remember later when she is able to handle it.¬†¬† And with the wave of the wand the good fairy¬† says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to send things into different¬†¬† parts of your body. And they‚Äôre going to hold them¬† for you until you feel strong enough to let them¬†¬† move freely again.‚Äù And she explains that she is¬† going to help the little girl tighten and dull her¬†¬† pelvis and her belly and she is going to constrict¬† her heart and throat and protect her from feeling¬†¬† the raw intensity of the hurt and¬† the fear and the broken-heartedness.¬†¬† And I‚Äôll read you the last part of the story.¬† This is the fairy speaking. ‚Äú‚ÄôYou‚Äôll have trouble¬†¬† feeling and being close to people, but it‚Äôll be¬† your way of surviving. At those times that the¬†¬† pain irrupts you‚Äôll find your own ways to control¬† it, ways that may not look good to the world but¬†¬† will be of temporary comfort. And you my darling¬† will be a fairly functional human being in spite¬†¬† of all this because you have a strong mind and¬† you can hold this all in and I‚Äôll be helping you.‚Äô¬†¬† The child looked directly into the fairy‚Äôs eyes¬† and asked, ‚ÄòHow will you help? Will you come back¬†¬† to see me?‚Äô ‚ÄòYou will not forget everything.¬† I will leave a voice inside you that will urge¬†¬† you to reconnect with your whole self. It may be¬† a very long process but in time you‚Äôll feel an¬†¬† urgent calling to step out of imprisoning¬† beliefs, to unwind your body and release¬†¬† what‚Äôs been holding all these years. You‚Äôll learn¬† the art of sacred presence. There will be physical¬†¬† and emotional pain as you open but you‚Äôll have¬† what you need - the compassion and wisdom,¬†¬† the support of loving others ‚Äì to be a whole¬† person, spiritually awake but still the same.¬†¬† This is because your soul has always been there¬† just hidden by the scars of this lifetime.‚Äô¬†¬† The good fairy put the arm around the child‚Äôs¬† shoulders and gently lead her into her bed. She¬†¬† waved her wand and stood by as the little¬† girl finally relaxed into a deep sleep.¬†¬† She gazed tenderly at the small, innocent¬† face and then whispered her goodbye,¬†¬† ‚ÄòWhen you wake up you‚Äôll forget that I was¬† here. You‚Äôll forget you asked for help.¬†¬† You‚Äôll forget the sharpness of your daily pain.¬† This is the only way I know to get you through¬†¬† this. You are a beautiful child. I love you. And¬† in fact your parents love you although they are¬†¬† incapable of showing it to you. You‚Äôll have¬† to love yourself enough to heal so that when¬†¬† you‚Äôre older your life will be powerful, full¬† and free. One day you will know who you really¬†¬† are. You‚Äôll trust your goodness and know your¬† belonging. Until then and for always I love you.‚Äô‚Äù¬† So I shared her story in a talk I gave ‚Äì of course¬† she gave me permission ‚Äì and after that talk so¬†¬† many lined up to talk to me. And their sharings¬† were very similar. One person put it so clearly,¬†¬† she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been so ashamed of the¬† addiction, of the conflictual relationships,¬†¬† the rage, shutting down and listening to this I¬† realized it wasn‚Äôt my fault but I was trying to¬†¬† control the trauma. I didn‚Äôt have a better¬† way.‚Äù And she said again, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have¬†¬† a better way.‚Äù And it was that sense of relief,¬† this glimmering of self-forgiveness. And so many¬†¬† had something similar that if they could just get¬† that it was the best they could do at the time,¬†¬† there was some sense of hope and possibility.¬† But they needed to forgive themselves first.¬†¬† I remember in a similar way a man I worked¬† with a few years ago. Company downsized and he¬†¬† got laid off and he tried for a few years just¬† tried everything to get a job and he couldn‚Äôt¬†¬† and he descended into this panic,¬† depression, sleeplessness, you know,¬†¬† he was taking anxiety medication and he¬† more and more withdrew from other people,¬†¬† really avoided other people, and his marriage was¬† falling apart, he was really filled with shame.¬†¬† And I remember working with him and finally¬† at some point saying, ‚ÄúThis is trauma.¬†¬† And it‚Äôs not your fault.‚Äù And something¬† cracked open. He started weeping.¬†¬† It was the beginning of some self-compassion, the¬† beginning of healing. And he gradually reached¬†¬† out to friends, he joined a men‚Äôs group, he¬† started reengaging, he was on a path of healing.¬† Trauma is a universal response to endangerment¬† - when we are powerless - as are the symptoms¬†¬† of PTSD when trauma hasn‚Äôt been processed. It‚Äôs¬† universal. And what starts to release the shame is¬†¬† a kind of cellular realizing ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault,‚Äù¬† it‚Äôs not our fault that we get traumatized,¬†¬† it‚Äôs not our fault when we‚Äôre unable to process¬† the trauma, it‚Äôs not our fault that our nervous¬†¬† system reacts with anxiety, with depression,¬† it‚Äôs not our fault that then there are the¬†¬† behaviors aimed at controlling pain, coping¬† strategies. And this was the realization the¬†¬† woman who wrote that story about the fairy ‚Äì¬† that it was intelligent to shut down feelings¬†¬† when they were too much to handle ‚Äì and the coping¬† strategies that followed were her way of eating,¬†¬† her way of controlling her body experience,¬† avoiding intimacy, it was the best she could do.¬† So I‚Äôm spending some time with this because where¬† there is trauma there is shame that‚Äôs asking our¬†¬† attention and healing. And I extend this and¬† say: With any deep emotional wounding ‚Äì neglect,¬†¬† criticism, be trail, rejection ‚Äì somewhere deep¬† down we feel it‚Äôs our fault and we‚Äôre ashamed¬†¬† of the way the wounding affects our personality¬† and behaviors, we think we should be different.¬†¬† If you can recognize this shame and dedicate to¬† releasing it ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs possible¬†¬† to then bring healing directly to the place of¬† trauma - to woundedness - and begin to open.¬† Let‚Äôs pause here and reflect for a moment. You¬† might consider where you might be living with¬†¬† generational trauma or with early trauma, wounds¬† from a lack of good nurturing - in other words¬†¬† poor attachment ‚Äì bonding, you know, where¬† might you have some experience of trauma,¬†¬† where have you been outside¬† the window of tolerance¬†¬† and then had to develop coping strategies¬†¬† to work with what‚Äôs going on inside¬† you ‚Äì maybe dissociating from the body,¬†¬† maybe anger, addictive behaviors, avoidance¬† of real intimacy, neediness, co-dependency.¬†¬† So just check and see where that might¬† be in your life, how it‚Äôs presented.¬†¬† Trauma and then the reaction to trauma.¬†¬† And as you do honestly check and sense:¬† Have you felt shame about woundedness?¬†¬† Have you felt shame about the ways you have¬† tried to protect yourself from feeling too much?¬†¬† And as you explore this you¬† might put your hand on your heart¬†¬† and just be aware of what‚Äôs going on inside,¬† the places of self-judgment or shame,¬†¬† and let some of the places of judgment come¬† right to the foreground. And as they do you¬†¬† might explore what happens when you say¬† with kindness, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault.‚Äù And¬†¬† if it helps you might imagine¬† someone you trust our love¬†¬† be the one to say it, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault.‚Äù¬†¬† I invite you to hear it, to let it in, and if it‚Äôs¬† hard to let it in this message pray to let it in.¬†¬† Again from the fairy story, ‚Äú‚ÄôYou‚Äôll¬† have to love yourself enough to heal¬†¬† so that when you‚Äôre older your life¬† will be powerful, full and free.¬†¬† One day you will know who you really are. You¬† will trust your goodness and now your belonging.¬†¬† Until then and for always I love you.‚Äô‚Äù If¬†¬† your eyes are closed, you might open them. In many shamanistic cultures the process¬†¬† of reconnecting ‚Äì of releasing the shame¬† and processing the trauma ‚Äì it‚Äôs called¬†¬† soul retrieval. And it‚Äôs believed that when¬† a person is traumatized the soul leaves the¬†¬† body as a way of protecting it from intolerable¬† pain. And in the process of soul retrieval the¬†¬† traumatized person is held in a love and safety¬† of community as the soul is invited to return.¬†¬† I like this description because I‚Äôve heard many¬† who heal from trauma describe recovering a sense¬†¬† of soul, of spirit, recovering a sense of the¬† dimensions of sacred that live through them and¬†¬† had been cut off. And likewise in other healing¬† contexts the care‚Ä¶ just in this one it‚Äôs the¬†¬† community ‚Äì the care of therapists, friends,¬† teacher might initially provide the safety¬†¬† to reconnect with some degree of authentic¬† presence and well-being inside. We need it.¬†¬† I always think of that little story of it‚Äôs¬† a stormy night and a child calls out for his¬†¬† parents because he is scared of the thunder. And¬† the father goes in and he says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. You¬†¬† can trust that God is with you.‚Äù And he is with¬† the child a little and then he leaves the room and¬†¬† then the child starts whaling again and the father¬† comes back and again reassures him, you know,¬†¬† ‚ÄúGod is with you.‚Äù And he leaves the room. And¬† finally the child is crying and he comes back¬†¬† in and the child says, ‚ÄúYou know, I know God¬† is with me but I want someone with skin on.‚Äù¬†¬† So I love that because we need the interpersonal,¬† we need the relational support in healing from¬†¬† trauma, from that cut off feeling. And as we‚Äôve¬† been talking we also have a relationship with our¬†¬† inner life. And that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre cultivating. I so often think of psychologist Luis¬†¬† Cozolino who says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not survival of¬† the fittest, it‚Äôs survival of the nurtured.‚Äù¬† So this last part of what we‚Äôre exploring is how¬† the self-nurturing that comes with some facets¬†¬† of meditation is exactly what we need, exactly¬† what we need in this process of healing trauma.¬†¬† And we need enough access to safety¬† and care to be able to open mindfully.¬†¬† And partly we build that in a daily meditation¬† that we adapt in a way that allows us to really¬†¬† feel safe enough. There are many instructions¬† that get offered and we think ‚ÄúOh well,¬†¬† meditating means I have to close my eyes.‚Äù You¬† can customize any part of the instructions. Find¬†¬† out for yourself in your daily practice if it¬† is better to have your eyes open or closed.¬†¬† The posture: It‚Äôs always assumed we are sitting¬† but you could be lying down or standing.¬†¬† For some with PTSD movement really helps¬† because sitting still is difficult, too scary.¬†¬† You can spend some time and sense: What is the¬† anchor that really serves you? It might not be¬†¬† the breath because breath is sometimes difficult¬† for people who have PTSD. Find an anchor ‚Äì maybe¬†¬† it‚Äôs sound, certain parts of the body that¬† either are neutral or positive in sensation,¬†¬† begin by grounding yourself,¬† feel the earth beneath you.¬†¬† I have a PDF that is available on how to¬† customize your daily meditation if you have¬†¬† PTSD and it‚Äôs on the homepage on my website¬† and that can give you more guidance in this.¬† So let‚Äôs look at what happens when distressing¬† or strong emotions start taking over. What then?¬†¬† And just to remind you that while you might¬† have enough tolerance to face or lean in,¬†¬† it‚Äôs very wise and compassionate to recognize¬† when you don‚Äôt, that this might be a time like¬†¬† Perseus to not face directly and instead to¬† emphasize self-nurturing. Once you are back¬†¬† in your window of tolerance, you can then return¬† to a more direct contact filled with mindfulness.¬†¬† Okay, so how do we self-nurture?¬† The training is to pre-identify¬†¬† a way of self-resourcing that you can then call on¬† when you are distressed. And there are many types.¬†¬† You could be sending a message to¬† yourself that comforts and soothes you,¬†¬† all types of messages. You could visualize¬† someone you love - imagine they are either¬†¬† hugging you or giving you a message of comfort¬† -, you can visualize a safe space ‚Äì place you‚Äôve¬†¬† been to or a place in your imagination -, you¬† can gently touch your heart as I often teach.¬†¬† All of these if they are familiar to you, you¬† might recognize them as part of the N of RAIN,¬†¬† Nurture. And so the training is to practice this¬† self-nurturing with these resources when you are¬†¬† not activated, when you‚Äôre feeling okay,¬† as part of your daily meditation perhaps¬†¬† so that the pathway to the window of tolerance¬† is more available when you do get triggered,¬†¬† so that you‚Äôre more able to remember the¬† pathway back to your inner resourcefulness.¬†¬† I was working with a woman in DC ‚Äì a Latina¬† woman who is very active in immigration and¬†¬† serving the local community doing social¬† justice work and so on ‚Äì and she had a lot¬†¬† of childhood trauma and was also regularly¬† around people who were traumatized including¬†¬† in her extended family and those who she works¬† with. And she found that when she was activated,¬†¬† she couldn‚Äôt calm herself with self-compassion,¬† she couldn‚Äôt put her hand on her heart and give¬†¬† herself a message, she felt too regressed, too¬† damaged, too flawed. So her pathway ‚Äì what she¬†¬† discovered would work ‚Äì was she brought to mind¬† her grandmother who was very strong and empowered,¬†¬† kind of a spiritual matriarch in the family; and¬† brought also to mind other women in the family;¬†¬† but her grandmother was the key one. And¬† she imagined her grandmother saying to her,¬†¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here with you, you can trust your heart,¬† it‚Äôs okay‚Äù and just kind of touching her cheek.¬†¬† Once she identified this ‚Äì just bringing¬† to mind an image of her grandmother and¬†¬† that touch and that message ‚Äì that became a¬† central part of her daily practice. Every day¬†¬† she would invoke that sense and feel the¬† experience of that comforting presence.¬†¬† And if you‚Äôre doing this, it really helps to¬† start your daily meditation with self-nurturing,¬†¬† to end it, to use it as often as it‚Äôs possible¬† because repetition makes a difference.¬†¬† In neuroscience it‚Äôs described as ‚Äúentraining¬† and installing.‚Äù What‚Äôs happening is there is old¬†¬† pathways in the brain that you‚Äôve been repeating¬† over and over again that are anxious pathways,¬†¬† worry pathways, fear pathways and you‚Äôre¬† creating new pathways; and the more you¬†¬† repeat them ‚Äì the pathways to self-nurturing ‚Äì¬† the more access you‚Äôll have. Once that is there,¬†¬† once that resource is strong, you can do¬† what‚Äôs called ‚Äúpendulating‚Äù and that means¬†¬† you can go from feeling that resourceful place¬† to dipping in a bit to where the fear lives. And¬†¬† each time the fear feels a little too strong you¬† come back to the place of feeling resourced. And¬†¬† gradually what happens is by bringing some¬† of the qualities of feeling resourced to that¬†¬† wounded place it begins to get processed.¬† This is what it means to process, to digest¬†¬† or heal trauma. It‚Äôs to be able to bring¬† an increased sense of presence and care¬†¬† to a place inside you, in your body, feeling¬† it where you‚Äôve been storing the trauma.¬†¬† Just to kind of loop back to the fairy story.¬† This was the process this woman did. She would¬†¬† call on that sense of the good fairy and feel¬† her presence and feel herself held and really¬†¬† nurtured and safe in that presence. And then she‚Äôd¬† go to the parts of the body that had really stored¬†¬† the trauma. And there were stories with them and¬† very strong feelings. Bit by bit over many months.¬†¬† And she found that as she did that she started¬† experiencing this growing freedom, this capacity¬†¬† to, you know, actually be with other people in a¬† more intimate way, her eating disorder lightened.¬†¬† Similarly, with this other woman that I¬† just brought up ‚Äì bringing her grandmother,¬†¬† feeling her grandmother‚Äôs presence ‚Äì she was¬† able to very quickly come back into that window¬†¬† of tolerance. The fears would still come up¬† but she knew how to pause, how to breathe,¬†¬† how to bring that image to her mind and how to¬† find her way back to that more integrated place.¬† So I want to step back here friends and say:¬† This is an archetypal process that like Perseus¬†¬† we first need to redirect our attention and¬† find ‚Äì in this case I am describing the kind¬†¬† of self-nurturing that increases our sense of¬† safety ‚Äì and then once we are back inside the¬†¬† window of tolerance ‚Äì we are not overwhelmed¬† ‚Äì then we can begin to open to old wounds.¬† So what I‚Äôd like to do is close with a¬† practice. And this is a guided meditation¬†¬† that offers a pathway to our own inner¬† resources in the face of intense emotion.¬†¬† I‚Äôd like to invite you to¬† find a comfortable posture,¬†¬† whatever position allows you¬† to feel most safe and present.¬†¬† If it helps to begin to collect your¬† attention with a few full breaths.¬†¬† Feel the earth beneath you,¬† the weight of your body,¬†¬† sense of contact right here. Your¬† eyes could be open or closed.¬†¬† And now scan and see who in your life brings you¬† comfort, brings you a sense of love and safety. It¬†¬† might be a grandparent, child, friend, healer, pet¬† ‚Äì could be living or not -, could be an ancestor¬†¬† or perhaps a spiritual figure you¬† haven‚Äôt personally met, deity,¬†¬† divine mother, Buddha, Allah, Jesus.¬†¬† In other words: Sense who helps you to feel the¬† type of love or safety that you want to access¬†¬† when things are difficult. So take some moments¬† to imagine and visualize that person or being.¬†¬† You might imagine their eyes looking¬† at you with an expression of care.¬†¬† And sense the love, the energy surrounding¬† you when you bring that being to mind. And¬†¬† you might attune to what words of¬† wisdom from this being - from this¬†¬† presence - what reminder might most¬† comfort the fearful part inside you.¬†¬† What does that part most¬† need to remember, to trust?¬†¬† Sense this message being offered and¬† what is it like in your body and in¬†¬† your heart when you let the love¬† and wisdom of a caring being in?¬†¬† And if it‚Äôs hard to let it in just let that be¬† your sincere prayer: ‚ÄúMay I let in this care.¬†¬† May I let in the messages of truth.‚Äù¬†¬† And you can even visualize the loving¬† bathing you, bathing the cells inside you.¬†¬† So it‚Äôs surrounding you and permeating you.¬†¬† And see if you can sense that felt¬† experience of being safe and loved, a¬†¬† belonging to something larger, a¬† larger source, resting in that.¬†¬† Okay, now shifting your attention, please bring to¬† mind a situation that you know can evoke fear in¬†¬† you, not trauma but some level of fear. It might¬† be something that arises in a relationship with¬†¬† somebody, it could be a situation ‚Äì maybe¬† a social kind of setting that scares you -,¬†¬† something related to work, financial¬† security, your own or another‚Äôs health.¬†¬† And let the situation be close in so you can¬† actually sense it like you‚Äôre watching a movie,¬†¬† play it out to get a taste¬† of the fear that it evokes¬†¬† so you‚Äôre noticing where you are,¬†¬† the look on other people‚Äôs faces,¬†¬† whatever is going on, the words that are¬† exchanged, fearful thoughts or beliefs.¬†¬† And let‚Äôs just sense where the fear lives in¬† you, what it‚Äôs like, how you experience it.¬†¬† And then in a very intentional way you might take¬† a full breath and intend to resource yourself,¬†¬† intend self-nurturing. And you might begin by¬† grounding. Just feel yourself sitting right here.¬†¬† Feel the weight of your bottom on the¬† seat, the warmth of your feet on the floor,¬†¬† the gravity that pulls you to this beloved¬† planet, our larger body right here.¬†¬† And again imagine that comforting being.¬†¬† Look at the image and the felt sense¬† of that being and sense close in¬†¬† eyes that are caring, hear the words that are¬† comforting, and feel yourself held by, cared by¬†¬† belonging to a larger source.¬†¬† And you can now bring these resources with¬† you ‚Äì this sense of this loving being ‚Äì as¬†¬† you touch into the fear just a bit knowing that¬† you can touch and then return to a safe space,¬†¬† you can touch in, sense the fear,¬†¬† and feel the support of that¬† space of care, of nurturing.¬†¬† And if at any point the fear feels like¬† too much, go back and again re-imagine and¬†¬† strengthen and vitalize this connection with this¬† being and with the sense of being held and loved.¬†¬† So over the next few moments just sense that¬† back and forth ‚Äì the loving resource space¬†¬† and then touching in, feeling where the fear¬† lives in a very visceral way in your body¬†¬† and then back to the fullness of self-nurturing,¬† of the resource. And as you‚Äôre doing this it¬†¬† might help to slow your breathing down a bit¬† ‚Äì long, slow in-breath, long, slow out-breath.¬†¬† Be aware of your relationship with fear¬† in these moments, increasingly perhaps¬†¬† the possibility of inhabiting a sea of loving¬† presence and including the currants of fear,¬†¬† resting in that vat sea of loving, in¬† the heart-space that has room for fear.¬†¬† This is the true meaning of a fearless heart.¬†¬† For the last few moments, be the sea of loving¬†¬† and include the currants that are here¬† with tenderness, and clarity, and presence.¬†¬† And gently bringing yourself back. If your eyes¬† are closed opening them. A few full breaths.¬† So Rumi points to the same truth that we‚Äôve¬† been exploring really through these two segments¬†¬† on awakening and healing through trauma. And¬† his words are this, that ‚ÄúThe wound is the¬†¬† place where light enters you.‚Äù What if you really¬† trusted that? What if where there is woundedness¬†¬† you sense a real interest or curiosity:¬† How can I deepen this self-nurturing?¬†¬† How can I bring a presence that‚Äôs truly¬† healing to this place of woundedness?¬†¬† Unprocessed wounds can either fester in shame¬† or we can dedicate ourselves to loving ourselves¬†¬† into healing, letting the wounds become¬† a portal for true awakening, for freedom.¬† So we‚Äôll close in a simple¬† way, friends, with some meta.¬†¬† You might just let the attention again go inward.¬†¬† May we all love ourselves into¬† healing. Just sense what that means.¬†¬† Sense your dedication to that.¬†¬† May live from that field of loving presence¬† including all beings everywhere on our planet.¬†¬† May all beings everywhere¬† heal, awaken and be free.¬† Blessings, friends. Sending you much love.
0 so wherever you are right now i'd just like you to just take a moment to get comfortable it doesn't matter whether you're parked in a stationary car sat on a train somewhere maybe you've just arrived home maybe you haven't left work yet whatever it is wherever you are just taking a moment to sit comfortably don't have to be fully upright but at least that in a position which will allow you to find that balance of focus relaxation sense of ease in both the body and the mind and as you sit there just take a couple of nice big deep breaths breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth as you breathe in through the nose sense of taking in fresh air the lungs expanding the body expanding as you breathe out a sense of letting go letting go of whatever has been going on for you today feeling the muscles in the body soften as the body exhales just a couple more times taking deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth and the next time you breathe out if it feels more comfortable [Music] if you're in a place where it's easy and safe to do so you can just gently close your eyes and as you sit there just enjoy that initial sense of having just put everything down having left everything behind and just that feeling of being present again noticing the sensation of the body pressing down against the the seat the chair beneath you it's that feeling being grounded to feet on the floor hands and the arms on the legs and as you sit there just taking a moment without opening the eyes to just notice the environment around you as well maybe it's the sounds different smells maybe it's movement maybe it's stillness maybe it's the temperature maybe it's the wind if you're outside but with the eyes closed just becoming more familiar with the space around you and as you sit there starting to notice how the body feels so very often as we go through the day we accumulate tension just noticing if there are any obvious areas of tension in the body not doing anything to them they they'll unwind on their own if we approach them in the right way but just noticing how the body feels allowing any tension to come to the surface knowing that's a good thing allowing any tiredness any feeling of heaviness to come to the surface knowing that's a good thing so in letting go now at this stage we give the body and the mind space to be more alert more awake after the exercise i'm just starting to notice the the breath now as well the breath is also a good indication of how we're feeling in both body and mind and without trying to change the breath in any way just noticing whether the breaths are long short deep or shallow you can just gently place your hand on your stomach if you find that more comfortable easier to feel that movement and again even though thoughts may still continue to pop in perhaps about what's happened during the day where you've just come from or maybe even jumping ahead to what's to come each time you see the mind wander off just letting go of that and coming back to the present that feeling that sensation the movement of the breath and then mentally now i'm just going to imagine that the body the mind is taking a shower that any tension is being left behind just like you to imagine a warm ray of sunlight just shining down onto the body you can imagine that it shines down on your back your chest on top of your head whatever feels comfortable and it's as though it begins in one place but it expands outward in every direction and as it does so it just melts away any tension you can even kind of work systematically down through the body just watching feeling any tension melt away mentally we leave those thoughts behind physically we let go of whatever's accumulated during the day it expands outward in every direction all the way to the end of our fingers toes so it's as though the entire body is not really separate anymore from that idea of sunlight there's just a sense of ease warmth sense of having reset both the body and the mind for whatever is coming up next and in your own time when you're ready you can just gently open your eyes again you
0 This is a loving-kindness meditation. It will focus on compassion. This means compassion toward those around us... and reflecting the same compassion for ourselves. And it even means directing¬† love and compassion outward. To the earth... to the sky...¬† to the sun and universe. It will help us to appreciate and understand¬† the weight of each day of life that we receive. A free and harmonious life. It will help with the ability to embrace¬† and understand what is within our control... And to let go of that which is not. As always, find a favorite comfortable position. Begin to recognize your body. Any areas of¬† tension, letting your muscles begin to relax. And as you do, bring that¬† attention to your breath. Just notice it. Gently and naturally. In and out. You can use the air moving in and out¬† of your nostrils as a point of focus. You can also notice that gentle movement of your¬† chest as the air flows in and out of your lungs. If it is helpful, you can say to yourself¬† the words "in and out" on each breath. Even just in your head. Again, just as naturally as you always¬† breathe, but bringing your attention to it. And with each breath, letting all¬† your muscles relax just a bit more. And then, a bit more again. Breath by breath. And as you are here in this comforting place, If distracting thoughts try to¬† creep their way into your mind, It is fine. You can always recognize them¬† and just let them drift away. Just bringing your attention¬† back to breath and body. And, to my suggestions. Again and again. Recognizing a small victory each time you¬† notice a stray thought, and gently send it away. And so now, as you just gently¬† continue that breath and body focus... I will share with you some excerpts from¬† Buddhist discourse on loving-kindness. While I do so, you can just continue to relax,¬† focus your thoughts, and take these words in. Feeling them deeply as you¬† remember your breath and body. "May all beings be happy and secure" "May they be happy-minded" "May we not wish anger, no¬† ill-will or suffering of others" "May all beings, without¬† exception, be happy-minded" "Just as a parent would protect a child,¬† cultivate a boundless heart toward all beings" "Keep a strong mind, free¬† of enmity and negativity" "Let the thoughts of boundless loving-kindness,¬† in one true direction, pervade the whole world." As we settle into these thoughts, we understand¬† the universal nature of their themes. We see life and the world as it could be,¬†¬† and we recognize that we are just¬† one grain of that greater whole. And yet, have the ability to move mountains¬† with the strength of our outward love. Our resolve toward the betterment of humanity. And so now, we will move into affirmations¬† to bolster these themes of loving-kindness. And so if you like, just repeat each¬† short affirmation phrase after me¬†¬† in whatever way you see fit. Either out loud, or in your head. And I will leave just a¬† moment to process each one. Just a reminder to continue to focus on¬† your gentle and natural breath, in and out. And body... loose and relaxed muscles. Here in your comfortable space. We begin now. May my life be filled with happiness. May I be well in body and mind. May I give openly and freely. May I be filled with grace and compassion. Awesome. And now in this perfect¬† place that we have built, We will now send these¬† affirmations outward to all beings, And even to the earth, sky, and universe. Embrace and become one with¬† all that is good around you And feel that healing freedom that it brings. Feeling grateful and remembering¬† our breath and our body. We say once more: May all our lives be filled with happiness. May we all be well in body and mind. May we all give openly and freely. May our minds stay at ease¬† through times of challenge. May all the world be filled¬† with grace and compassion. Great. Go forth with confidence and pride. As a compassionate person, you can know that¬† your kindness will be put forth into the world, and passed along through everyone you encounter. Lao Tsu said: "Kindness in¬† words creates confidence." "Kindness in thinking creates profoundness." "Kindness in giving creates love." Let us lastly reinforce these ideas¬†¬† of loving-kindness by once again remembering¬† the lines from the Buddhist texts: May all beings be happy and secure. Cultivating a boundless heart toward all beings. A strong mind, free of negativity. Let thoughts of loving-kindness¬† pervade the whole world. So now the music will continue for just a bit and we will finish this session¬† and just count from 5 to 1. Starting now. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1.
0 Good morning. This is a brief session to help you¬† kickstart your day with a motivated,¬†¬† yet clear and focused mind as an¬† essential part of your morning routine. Let's get started. Find a meditation position¬† that works well for you. For this session, avoid laying down and instead,¬†¬† try sitting on the floor or¬† on the front edge of a chair. Keep your spine straight and¬† shoulders comfortably back. Staying relaxed yet alert. Feel free to roll your shoulders back a few times¬† or tilt your neck back and forth to loosen up. And as you find your spot, take¬† comfortable breaths, naturally in and out. Not forcing anything, but¬† bringing your attention to it. Feeling the air moving in¬† and out of your nostrils. And moving your chest up and down. If you like, add in a deeper¬† breath every little while,¬†¬† just to cleanse and refresh your whole body. Deeply in and out. And now, as you are settling into¬† this place of presence and energy,¬†¬† we will focus on going into¬† the day with a clear mind. As a part of your morning routine, it¬† is a great time to declutter your mind. Through this process, you will¬† be mindful of your own self-care. Keeping hold of feelings of love toward yourself. This will ultimately exude love and care outward¬† to others that you encounter during your day. And so, just listen to each following suggestion. And as you do, on the next¬† breath you take in and out, just¬†¬† deeply focus on that suggestion, as we begin now. I see the clutter in my mind. I let the thoughts float away. Making clear and open space. Beautiful, cleansed, and free. Letting go of what thoughts remain. Falling away like a waterfall. Then calm, still, and clear. A focused mind, a free mind. Fantastic job. We will perform this brief exercise once more. And this time, feel it twice¬† as deeply. Twice as clearly. Knowing that you only have a¬† bit of clutter yet to clear. We'll start again now. And remember, just¬† a breath in and out to bring focus to it. I see the remaining clutter in my mind. I let the thoughts float away. Making clear and open space. Beautiful, cleansed, and free. Letting go completely. Falling away like a waterfall. Then calm, still, clear. A focused mind, a free mind. Okay. Remember these key phrases throughout your day. And when an intrusive and non-helpful thought¬† tries to force its way into your thought patterns,¬†¬† you can be reminded of your reassuring breath. Just as you have a clear mind now,¬† you can let that thought drop away. At any point in your day, you can return¬† to a calm, clear, focused, and free mind. Welcome to your day. Embrace¬† it. Enjoy it. Love it. There won't be another day like today.

0 Take this time to center yourself, become present, and deepen the connection between mind and body. You can build a fire of motivation and energy. You can spread goodness and positivity. You are full of possibility. Just become aware of your natural breathing. You can use this as your anchor. Just as with your heartbeat, these are our reminders of the continual flow of life. Through this, we can recognize that there will always be a past -- always be a future. But as of right now, this moment, you are hearing my voice and staying present wherever you are. Right now there is only here and now. And you can embrace this and enjoy this. And as you do so, you can also recognize and embrace that sense of positivity. A feeling of forward momentum. To help with this, I will¬† count down from five to one, and will give some short phrases. These are reminders that you¬† can use throughout each day. So feel free to repeat after me either out loud or in your head, Starting now: Five: "Embracing the energy of life." Four: "Enjoying this moment." Three: "Finding the energy within me." Two: "Being a positive force." One: "Out into the world." And just once more, I will repeat "Being a positive force out into the world." Wonderful. Deeply feel this simple yet¬† powerful message within you. Your body and mind acting as one. Right now, take just a¬† minute of comfortable silence to reflect on these ideas and feel them everywhere. Not in just your mind but¬† throughout your entire body, and even in the aura around you. Peace, positivity, energy, love. Reflect on this now. Great. And now, if you like, just allow a deep rejuvenating breath or two. Just deeply in, and out, and in, and out. You can do more at your own pace if you like. And when you like, return once again to that¬† calming and relaxing state of presence and natural breath. And as you are feeling so at peace yet motivated for whatever next steps are ahead of you, we will embrace that energy, embrace that forward momentum, and we'll count once more. First with our phrases, and then, as we ready ourselves¬† to finish this session, just with numbers. Reflecting and feeling this again, deeply within and around us. Starting now. Five: "Embracing the energy of life." Four: "Enjoying this moment." Three: "Finding the energy within me." Two: "Being a positive force." One: "Out into the world." Keep this forward momentum, spread it by means of your centeredness, your calm, your goodness. And still feel the fire of¬† motivation and energy within you. You can remind yourself at any time. There is no limit to your positivity and goodness. There's no limit to your possibility. And so, we prepare to finish our session today with this last countdown. And we'll start it with: Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
0 You are invited to take this¬† time to center yourself, improve your connection with yourself, and, if necessary, forgive yourself. You are worthy. To get us started, find a position that¬† is comfortable for you for this session. It could be seated in a chair¬† with hands resting on your legs, or cross-legged on a pillow or bed. Begin to prepare your body¬† by relaxing your muscles, yet remembering to remain focused¬† and present throughout our time. Relax your jaw, your shoulders, your arms. Bring that relaxing energy down through your body, into your legs. All the way down out the tips of your toes. Just relaxing every muscle a bit more. And as you do, begin to focus on your breath. Just letting it move in and out. Just as naturally as you had been breathing¬† before you were thinking about it. Notice that gentle chest movement, the airflow in and out of your nostrils. Just so comfortable and present. Continuing to relax, bring yourself further and¬† further into this present moment, and become ready to hear the¬† words of today's session. Each day presents us with many challenges, and through all of it, we are often the harshest critics of ourselves. Our minds can lead us down paths of¬† unnecessary stress and dissatisfaction. It can become a weight and a burden on us. A heaviness pressing us slowly down. But the wonderful part of this process is that we are capable of reminding¬† ourselves that we are worthy. We are worthy of peace. Worthy of a still mind. Worthy of self-love. We can let go of the mental baggage¬†¬† so that we can freely deal with the¬† challenges that are truly in front of us. And throughout this process¬† forgiving ourselves for mistakes and recognizing how to improve as we move forward. Always looking forward. So as you continue to get settled in, take one or two deep and¬† comfortable breaths, if you like. Feeling your chest fill and release. Relaxing more and more each time, but also remembering to stay present. Try this for several cycles,¬† if it feels comfortable. Those deep breaths in and out. And slowly allow your breath just¬† to settle into a natural pattern, but always keeping your¬† attention on that continual flow: in and out. You can use this time to remind¬† yourself of the constant cycle of life. Your breath, your heartbeat, your blood flow. All the tiny miraculous processes that make¬† it possible for you to be here in this space. Feeling the sensations of the room. You are focused and present, yet still relaxed. Just enjoying each moment here and now. So now, I invite you to take one minute to silently remind yourself to remain centered and enjoy this calm and peace. Remembering that this, right now, is your time. Remembering that you are worthy of this. Recognizing each breath in and out, we start now. Great. And now, I invite you to bring¬† focus to this idea of self-worth by repeating a few of these short affirmations. You can say them out loud or in your head. Just slowly repeating them after¬† me or just listening to them. Starting now: "I am worthy." "I am worthy of love." "I am worthy of being forgiven." "I am worthy of joy." "I am worthy of peace." "I am worthy of stillness." "I am worthy." Excellent. And so, now, as you are here in this¬† calm, focused, and present space, we can remind ourselves that negativity,¬† doubt, belittling self-thought: all of this is not useful or¬† beneficial to our self-improvement. By keeping a daily awareness of our thoughts, we can recognize these intrusive thoughts. Catch them as they happen. And then, with the next gentle breath outward, can just allow them to float away and give no time or energy to them. Through this process, we recognize our worth and then become free to¬† pursue our real challenges. Our goals and our aspirations. And so, now, I share with¬† you a few last affirmations that I once again invite you to¬† repeat after me, if you so choose. Beginning now: "With this next breath, I release negativity." "With this next breath, I embrace this moment." "With this next breath, I see my worth." "With this next breath, I am at peace." Fantastic job. You are capable of being at peace. You are capable of being connected¬† to each and every moment. Remember this as you go forth into each day, each hour, each breath. So now, if you like, spend a few more minutes here in¬† this place of peace and presence. As you reflect on them, allow yourself to feel them twice as deeply, twice as true. Let these ideas comfort you twice as much. And know that you are worthy of being forgiven. You are worthy of joy. You are worthy of peace. You are worthy of stillness of the mind. You are worthy.
0 [Music] hi and welcome to the Himalayas we're in the Himalayas we are just at the road from the monastery where I ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist monk so we're in northern India we're in the de Langella mountain range and we're a little bit below the snow line and we know an incredibly beautiful forest by day this forest is magic by night's terrifying it's leopards as monkeys the whole thing but by day is very peaceful and the Sun sort of just comes in through the trees and create a very particular atmosphere and there's a very particular smell in the forest as well you just create a very particular atmosphere and the sounds as if you can hear a tea right now there's today actually is Tibet a new year it's it's Losar so you might hear some some music and some celebrations in in the background you might hear the stream at the bottom of the bottom of the hillside here and there's a pretty good chance of during the meditation today you're gonna hear a lot of sounds of different birds as well so it's a really magical place is a place that means a huge amount to me personally and a place where I really wanted to bring you so that we could have meditate together so find a spot get comfortable and we'll begin [Applause] so just take a moment to settle into the forest here I'm gonna start with our eyes open looking out towards the mountainside the snow-capped peaks in the distance and the trees all around and just maintaining that very soft focus has taken a cup a nice big deep breath breathing in through the nose and out through me [Applause] there's your breathing just imagining your breathing in that fresh mountain air as you breathe out just letting go of any tension in the body well them all just one more time breathing in through the nose and that's for the man and throughout this meditation you can either have your eyes open eyes closed whatever feels most comfortable but either way just take a moment just to enjoy the view the sounds just enjoying that feeling of having taken some time out for yourself and just feel the weight of the body the price is down notice how the body feels today when your game just take a moment mr.

0 This is a guided meditation on being fearless. As you begin to get settled in, find a comfortable position And bring your attention to taking comfortable and natural breaths. Becoming aware of the air movement And the movement in your chest. Allowing your body to be relaxed, yet alert. Bringing awareness to every part of it. Your eyes. Hands. Feet. The surface you are sitting or laying on. Every detail clear and present. And as you find this place of presence, I will share with you our theme of being fearless. In such a complex and unpredictable world, Fear can find its way into our mind in many ways. Fear about making the wrong decision. Fear about the future. Fear of the unknown. Healthy fear, or caution, as we will call it, Allows us to make informed decisions To protect and shield against harm. But less healthy fears could be those that Might not have clear resolutions. They could be situations or unknowns That we are unable to change. They are the kinds of fears that won‚Äôt immediately bring about proaction But instead, take our mind away from presence and peace. Instead of pushing away those less healthy fears when they arise, It is good and right for us to acknowledge them, But then we allow ourselves to set them aside. To remind ourselves that these fears do not have control over us Or our contentment. And so, as you bring your attention to these ideas, Recognizing the differences between Healthy caution and less healthy fear‚Ä¶ Just continue to focus on that natural breath In‚Ä¶ and out. Just allowing your body to become a bit more relaxed And your mind to be a bit more present With each and every breath in‚Ä¶ and out. And just again, remembering to bring focus and relaxation To every part of your body. Like a gentle wave You can feel it move from the top of your head All the way down and out the very tips of your toes. With that gentle breath and air movement, Recognizing your heartbeat Allow yourself to find this place of stillness. And as you do so, I invite you to join in on some short phrases That will serve as reminders. Whether out loud or in your head, You can just repeat after me After each phrase Feeling each word and phrase deeply As you hear them Starting now: In every moment Aware of fearful thoughts. Welcoming this fear. Recognizing this fear. Then setting my fear aside. Just for now. Setting my fear aside. Great job. It is our instinct to run from our fear when such thoughts arise. A thought of a fear that we cannot control‚Ä¶ Or a fear of something of much greater consequence than ourselves But what are running from? We run from a thought, and not the real fear. And therefore, we become stuck in a loop with no exit. We let it linger, chase us, cloud our vision Build our anxiety. This process and action of setting our fears aside, Is a useful tool. And we can also use this with anxiety that can arise from fear. Welcoming it, recognizing it, But not allowing it to overcome us Or eat away at us. Only allowing ourselves to process it When such thoughts will cause useful action in the present time Rather than useless strain on our mind and body. And so, I invite you to repeat these phrases, once again. But this time, focusing on the anxiety that stems from fear. Breathing gently, Continuing to sit comfortably. Beginning now. In every moment‚Ä¶ Aware of anxious thoughts. Welcoming this anxiety. Recognizing this anxiety. Then, setting my anxiety aside. Just for now. Setting my anxiety aside. Excellent again. Sometimes, setting aside our fear and anxiety Is more easily said than done. You an use these techniques to serve as a daily, Or even minute by minute reminder That there are so many of those useless and unhelpful thoughts Floating around within our minds. We can practice being proactive Rather than reactive with our mind. We can find such peace When we allow ourselves to pull our mind along Rather than let our minds unconsciously pull us. And so now, as you are here in this place of presence, Recognizing your fears, Recognizing your anxiety, If you like, stay here with this background music For the next little while. And in these last few spoken moments of this session. I encourage you to just continue to connect deeply With your mind and body. Continue to sense yourself in this place, Enjoy becoming the watcher of your thoughts And practice that relationship with your fear and anxiety. And again, not pushing away or running away, But welcoming, recognizing, And then just setting aside. Know that you CAN make this better for yourself. You can be strong. You can be present and aware. You practice and know that you can do this. And so, you WILL do this Fearless.

their energetic restrictions in our life there are seven chakras and each stacked in a perfect Divine ladder along the column of our own spines and each day we will Ascend up this energetic ladder from the bottom to the top in order to balance and recharge each one in order that they are located today we'll begin with the first one the root chakra which is located at the base of our spine and is responsible for your sense of Safety and Security on this journey on Earth it consists of everything that grounds us to stability in our life by working on opening and balancing a root chakra would give ourselves the opportunity to feel more connected to ourselves to our mind and body and to the Earth so let's take this moment again and just connect to our breath and let it Let It Go Mother

arm that the leg is extended up to the sky so if your right leg is extended the right arm reaches up and again if you're halfway down with your hands on the mat that's perfectly fine as well and then from here transitioning into our wide legged forward fold by extending the bent knee and slightly pigeon toe your toes towards each other to protect the knees as you release into your wide legged

middle of your mat as you bend that back knee and once again in your skandasana you may want to stop here or maybe you want to go down even lower again my friends I just always want to remind you to listen to your body and adjust to what feels right if you're down low and like to add movement go ahead and bring your forehead down and up to the fluidity of your breath inhale and exhale inhale

0 This is a brief guided mindfulness¬† meditation on recognizing your emotions. Breathe naturally and comfortably.¬†¬† Welcoming a relaxation of your eyes,¬† neck, and shoulders, arms, hands, legs. Begin to get a sense of the state of your¬† mind and body in the space that you are in. Allow yourself to settle into¬† a comforting state of presence. Enjoy a new sense of awareness in these moments. And as you bring your focus to my voice, and¬† to your place here in the present moment,¬†¬† we focus and reflect on our emotions. What may seem simple on the surface,¬†¬† such as a feeling of "happy" or¬† "sad", is so often much more complex. Feelings can arise seemingly out of our control,¬†¬† and come from places that we¬† may not immediately understand. Continue just to relax, breathe¬† comfortably, have awareness in the present. Negative emotions can sneak up on us,¬†¬† causing us not to recognize them until¬† they have already deeply affected us. Feelings of contentment sometimes pass¬† us by without us even realizing it. What is important is to recognize when both¬† positive or negative emotions arise within us. Once we have that recognition, we¬† can choose to act on those feelings,¬†¬† but we don't necessarily need to. Simply being¬† aware is a form of process; of self-improvement. It is not wrong or bad to feel negative emotions.¬† These can happen naturally and could be an¬†¬† important part of working through difficulty¬† or grieving. But it is important to recognize¬†¬† where these negative emotions come from¬† and when they start to overtake us. Anger, fear, guilt, whatever difficult feeling¬† arises, we must continuously listen to our minds. Sometimes it may feel like a¬† constant storm brewing within us.¬†¬† Watching and understanding can be¬† our key to feeling more in control,¬†¬† more present, more at peace. And so, following this spoken¬† portion of the meditation,¬†¬† feel free to take a few minutes to¬† silently meditate on your emotions. Remembering to keep a¬† watchful eye on your emotions. Work to understand them and how¬† they are affecting each of us. Decide if the emotion necessitates action. Relax and stay in the presence of your emotions. And if the feeling is right, just¬† let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Recognizing our emotions.

0 there will be times in all of our lives when we will inevitably experience suffering and loss you may be going through this right now or you may have gone through it in the past in these situations you may feel overwhelmed detached fearful or full of anxiety confusion helplessness or profound sadness to a certain extent these feelings are human and normal however they can be magnified even more if a tragic event strikes whether as a close personal situation [Music] or as a difficult event on a larger scale many we are seeing on a daily basis this meditation session is intended to help us understand our feelings and connect more deeply with the present moment it will help us to see the underlying beauty despite the challenging circumstances to begin as i so often suggest find a comfortable position either seated in a chair or cross-legged on the ground sitting on carpet or having a pillow beneath you can help aim to have your body in a position that keeps you at ease but does not cause you to drift off to sleep be relaxed yet alert take a few deep and gentle breaths in and out begin to draw your attention to the movement of your chest into the airflow of your breath in and out [Music] raise your awareness of your own body arms legs head that gentle movement of the chest finding presence and awareness and as you settle in now we bring ourselves to a point of focus what is it that is weighing heaviest on your mind suffering and grief can be overwhelming and you may struggle to know exactly how you should be feeling think about this question and take a moment to recognize those scenarios and those specific feelings that are taking over your thoughts in the next minute or so try to mentally narrow down your biggest points of trouble or struggle to the top three some may be obvious or others less so so take a minute and try to imagine those top three now [Music] [Music] [Music] as you continue to breathe so gently and be aware of your body in the space that you are in we will attempt to dissect these thoughts and dissolve unnecessary pain and suffering something that can help us is to recognize what we can and cannot do about it when you think of these top three items weighing on your mind consider what are the things that you can personally control for example you can't take away someone's sickness but you can be compassionate toward them and toward their friends and family or although you cannot bring a loved one back that has passed away you can honor their memory and continue to spread love on their behalf [Music] sit and breathe in comfortable awareness and take a few moments to consider this for each thought which part is out of your control and which part can you control think about this now [Music] [Music] as you keep these thoughts in mind think about what these actions would mean to you if you were the one who suffered or was feeling lost this practice helps us to realize that there is a lot we often cannot control if we allow those things to weigh heaviest on our minds it can take away from our positive energy we can make a large impact by transferring that energy into an area of action that can make a difference now it is time to let go continue to breathe ever so calmly and gently feeling that awareness of your breath and of your body allow yourself to feel this present moment and realize that you are here sitting with your thoughts just you right now and as we start to let go think again of those things that you cannot change and realize how those intrusive thoughts will only weigh you down take another calm and gentle breath and say to yourself i let them go imagine those intrusive thoughts as a light balloon floating away rather than a heavy anvil on your mind say to yourself again i let them go each time imagine a small weight being lifted off your chest like these ocean waves drifting away each breath allowing you to feel lighter and free allow your mind to become open accepting of thought but aware of each thought that comes about if a negative thought arises catch that thought and imagine a positive thought or action to counteract and let go of the bad for just a bit longer as you continue to breathe gently and draw focus to your breath body and mind spend these last few minutes catching your thoughts as they arise and imagining positivity and strength [Music] [Music] [Music] well done now as you slowly prepare to go about your day choose an action small or large to implement and put into action today spreading joy and compassion are some of our best ways to combat the struggles and challenges that we all face find a connection to those around you near and far young and old suffering and healthy send and share your love and kindness even in small ways now as you prepare to go out and spread positive energy and feel positive energy for yourself let's take five last deep and rejuvenating breaths counting down from five four three two one [Music] wonderful job go about your day feeling uplifted and free of negative energy the beautiful ocean imagery in this meditation was provided by tank think you can learn more at tankthink.org mindful peace journey you

0 this is a meditation on love peace and happiness for the next little while find a comfortable position you can be sitting cross-legged on the floor seized in a chair or lying down whatever is best for you so long as you can allow yourself to remain focused and present in just a moment we will start by taking three deep rejuvenating breaths in and out as we do feel the air flow through your nostrils see your chest open up and then gently release breathing normally in between take the first breath in now and slowly relays allow your mind and body to feel free it's beginning to release any unwanted stress and tension [Music] now take another deep breath feeling that same release stress in tension [Music] and then once more deep breath feeling it to your nostrils filling your chest and then let the air release and then just continue to maintain calm relaxed the normal pattern of breathing as you settle in we recognize the present moment and gain focus on the here and now we realize that the past is only our memory in the future is just our projected thoughts but the ever passing present moment to moment it's where we are and where we want to be right now [Music] and as you continue to maintain that relaxed and natural breathing pattern just allow your mind to gently focus on either that gentle airflow in and out of your nose or that gentle movement of your chest up and down our breath into heartbeat are ever-present reminders of the methodical continuation of time not in a way that should make you anxious but just in realizing that we are a small piece of a vast universe we recognize ourselves as our own separate being and yet are one in the same as all other living things in all of nature and amongst the stars and planets and galaxies [Music] realize that beauty and the beauty around you and continuing to breathe comfortably begin to feel the entirety of yourself within your space you may notice certain slight tingling sensations throughout your body every nerve ending may become especially sensitive to your surroundings each detail such as a small extraneous noise with a light within the room the surfaces you're touching or the position of your body will all be a part of your awareness but you have no need to become attached to them simply remain aware of each detail and then continue to embrace the presence of this moment and down breathing gently and calmly ever present ever aware [Music] No we will draw our focus onto this feeling of love and peace by taking a few moments just allowing you to mentally recite few simple words and we will count down from five to one just slowly repeat these words in your mind you retain that awareness that complete and full awareness your surroundings without any attachment five love and peace [Music] mentally repeating after me for presence and contentment and again three love and peace [Music] to presence and contentment and finally what love and peace great now you may feel twice as calm twice as comfortable twice as aware and you'll feel that love for all things deep within you almost like a fire burning in the center of your being now we will do the same thing once more and this time with each number just allow yourself to become twice as focused twice as realized with every single number five I feel love and peace [Music] tor I feel presence and contentment 3 I feel love and peace - I feel presence and contentment choices relaxed with each number and finally one I feel love and peace although we often use the word happiness as a state of mind for which we ultimately wish to strive you may instead wish to think of the word contentment of the definition behind the word happiness a feeling of what we often consider overwhelming happiness's so very often fleeting unexpected this is an emotion for which we may strive for in vain and thus only end up with greater frustration yet a constant awareness can bring a lasting contentment a deep and profound yet subtle inner joy that persists through all of life's experiences it can keep us grounded through the times of great success or fortunate and also keep us afloat through tragedy and pain this deep awareness and ultimately love can be had for not only other people but for yourself and for all of existence we as human beings are uniquely capable of love and what an incredible gift to be aware of and express to others even an expression of love within ourselves is a positive step toward peace within such a constantly disruptive world and as you continue to listen to these thoughts and ideas with this full awareness of the present moment an awareness of a halt that is around you in the here and now embrace this now and mentally repeat after me once more this time with several shortening phrases to take with you once you finish I embrace love I embrace love I embrace peace [Music] I embrace peace I embrace contentment [Music] I embrace contentment I grace joy I embrace joy I embrace the here and now I embrace the here and now very good this will soon conclude the spoken portion of this session and so now you may choose to continue to meditate for several more minutes as the background music continues or prepare to come back and continue on throughout your day or perhaps fall asleep if you're at that point but now just hear these words one last time as we conclude love peace contentment joy here and now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music      
0 This is a guided mindfulness meditation¬† on calming the voice inside your head. As we begin, relax into a comfortable position but keep your mind and body alert, focused on my voice, and ready to hear these words and suggestions. Enjoy this time, and begin by focusing your energy on your¬† natural and gentle breaths in and out. Breathe effortlessly and recognize your body in this space. Feeling your limbs resting gently. You feel life flow through you. Welcome yourself into this¬† time of presence and peace, ready to allow yourself these moments. Feeling the tension in your muscles¬† melting away with each breath outward. Continuing that gentle breath, we will take a journey of self-understanding. And we'll begin with a short countdown, starting from five, four, three, two, one. Each of us has a voice that we carry with us. The one that creates a narrative in our mind. We might feel as though we are in full¬† control of these thoughts in our head, yet, if we reflect on the times¬† when we become lost in thought, allowing our mind to follow¬† all of its various pathways, we might realize that many of these thoughts¬† happen outside of our control and you may notice that you have¬† these thoughts each and every day. Every hour or even every minute. It might feel exhausting to have this¬† continual narrative happening in your mind, particularly if it brings you¬† anxious or worrisome thoughts. In this meditation and mindfulness session, we can send you down the road of separating¬† the anxiety-inducing and harmful thoughts and allow you to catch them before they take hold. It helps us to become the¬† constant watcher of our thoughts. In control and comfortably aware. Continuing now to focus on¬† that natural and gentle breath, body feeling oh so comfortable and calm, feeling these ideas deeply and on the next breath allow yourself to feel the presence¬† of your body twice as deeply. You may feel some tingles in your arms or legs. Enjoy being here and now, present and aware. Take a few moments to continue to center yourself and deepen your understanding of this¬† relationship with your thoughts. ¬† And in this moment, I invite you to share five short phrases. You can repeat them after me either out loud or in your head. And as you do so, just continue to enjoy this time. Starting now. Five: "Here in this moment." Four: "The watcher of my thoughts." Three: "Present and peaceful." Two: "Awareness in every breath." One: "Learning to know myself deeply." Great... Now, we will do a different count. And this time remembering the¬† kinds of unconscious thoughts we want to make ourselves aware of. And so continuing that comfortable breath, that present body, we start again. Five: "Aware of anxious thoughts." Four: "Aware of fearful thoughts." Three: "Aware of thoughts of painful memories." Two: "Aware of thoughts about the future." One: "Aware of myself here and now." And just once more. "Aware of myself here and now." You can use these phrases at¬† any time throughout the day when you find those unconscious¬† thoughts creeping in. You will begin to notice them more and will mentally praise yourself¬† when you let those thoughts melt away. Freeing yourself from the burden¬† of constant anxiety or fear. Lifting the weight that you have¬† carried in your mind for so long. So freeing like balloons floating up into the air. Allow yourself to let go and become aware in a way that you never imagined or even considered before. And so, as you're enjoying this time, we'll revisit our first countdown once more, feeling each word with weight and importance and knowing that you have a¬† healthier mindset ready for you that you can carry forward¬† into each moment of every day. And we'll start once more, now. Five: "Here in this moment." Four: "The watcher of my thoughts." Three: "Present and peaceful." Two: "Awareness in every breath." And one: "I will know myself deeply." Great job. If you like, take a few moments in¬† this place of peace and presence, then the session will conclude. Remembering that awareness in each moment, calming that voice in your head day by day, hour by hour, moment by moment. Freeing yourself of that burden. A weight you no longer need to carry. You have a beautiful future that awaits. My speaking portion concludes now.
0 [Music] it is so easy to allow our mind to let us get lost in thought this can lead to fear negativity or unnecessary pain imagine if all of our thoughts would stay focused on either what is happening in the present moment or on those thoughts that are truly helpful and beneficial to what is real imagine if all of our thoughts would stay positive and helpful in nature and we'd have the ability to separate out all of that useless baggage that our mind carries like a heavy weight [Music] imagine stepping back and watching your thoughts arise but staying disconnected almost laughing at them as you let them float away recognizing that they are just distractions and burdens or better yet imagine that you become fully present if unwanted thoughts or unhelpful thoughts do arise you are able to just let them float away before you can even process them maybe even subconsciously without even doing any work wouldn't that be freeing wouldn't that make for a better life every single day when you allow yourself to see this you can deal with any real challenges head on with greater clarity and you can appreciate those moments of presence more often more fully let's focus on that as we do our positive affirmation meditation so now as i always do i ask you to sit comfortably [Music] stretch a bit if you wish loosening up your neck and shoulders and gently bring your attention to your breathing focus on the air movement in and out of your nostrils or you may choose to direct your attention to your chest gently rising and falling and if you like take a few deep and rejuvenating breaths as you settle in [Music] you may choose to leave your eyes open yet relaxed allowing your gaze to settle on an object across the room or in the distance [Music] or you may instead allow your eyes to gently close yet keeping yourself alert and focused [Music] and now keeping that attention on your breath and body allow yourself to feel a deep sense of the present moment your head your arms legs hands and feet allow yourself to be here now and finally as you breathe so gently to get ourselves fully into this moment just count slowly either out loud or in your head from five to one five four [Music] three [Music] two one and with gentle breathing [Music] we'll do that once again and just a touch slower this time starting from five [Music] four three two [Music] one and now we move into the positive affirmation phase as with the counting feel free to repeat after me in your mind or say these phrases out loud directly after me i'll be sure to leave you enough space in between so now we begin [Music] i recognize my breath i recognize my body i am strong in mind and spirit [Music] i am the watcher of my thoughts [Music] i am here in the present moment i am free of judgment of myself [Music] i am free of judgment of others [Music] i love and accept myself i focus on what brings me contentment i am capable of deep joy i am thankful for all that i have i accept that which i cannot change [Music] i am grateful for my past present and future i can let go of negativity [Music] this moment is enough [Music] i am here now [Music] free of fear full of joy [Music] excellent job thus far that finishes up this first set of affirmations [Music] and now we will go through them once again and now that you're familiar with them as you say each phrase feel each one very deeply let every word hit with great force and feeling as we begin again [Music] i recognize my breath i recognize my body [Music] i am strong in mind and spirit [Music] i am the watcher of my thoughts [Music] i am here in the present moment [Music] i am free of judgment of myself i am free of judgment of others [Music] i love and accept myself i focus on what brings me contentment [Music] i am capable of deep joy i am thankful for all that i have i accept that which i cannot change [Music] i am grateful for my past present and future [Music] i can let go of negativity this moment is enough i am here now free of fear full of [Music] and joy those words sink deeply just taking a few more gentle relaxed breaths being here in this moment just enjoying this moment [Music] and now if you like you can stay here in this moment for as long as you wish or you can go on with the rest of your day or allow yourself to drift off to sleep [Music] as we just do a short count once again from five to one to become fully here and present counting now five [Music] four three two [Music] one positive affirmations [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you

0 [Music] this is a guided mindfulness meditation and finding contentment and inner peace as I so often ask you to do if you have been a part of my other sessions find a comfortable position either seated in a chair cross-legged on the ground or even lying in bed if you can remain focused and present you can choose to close your eyes or allow them to remain open until you find it helpful to close them throughout this session all that you need to worry about is hearing the sound of my voice if a distraction arises just acknowledge it briefly then return back to my voice remain in Pleasant stillness and hearing the sound of my voice as we begin just continue to take natural no comfortable breaths through your nostrils but drawing your attention to that air movement and the gentle movement of your chest notice how beautiful it is that we are constantly in the cycle of breathing and yet rarely take notice of it just as we breathe subconsciously so too can we find ourselves bringing about unnecessary worry and suffering in yet conversely can train ourselves to recognize the moments that our mind tries to create a struggle and subsequently realize the beauty of a still mind and body throughout our lives we know that change is inevitable and constant and yet we often try to fight this tide of change rejecting something that forces us into the unknown or brings about a circumstance that causes us suffering although change especially that which causes us pain can be difficult or unwelcome there is a means of finding beauty in our ever present state of change and retain an inner stillness even when the world around us is less than ideal [Music] continue to allow your mind to focus on this breathing exercise retaining that focus on the breath and the sound of my voice peace and stillness breath and voice there is a mantra that I will ask you to focus on throughout this session the mantra is this too shall pass why are these four words so important the phrase is so simple it can be intensely profound in your understanding of it perhaps there is a time in your life when a circumstance caused you great struggle you may have said to yourself this is terrible I don't want this I wanted to go away in those situations it can be so important and beneficial to recognize the beauty of the passage of time in the healing the time can bring this too shall pass at other times in life we may have moments that bring us profound joy and happiness in these situations we must also tell ourselves this too shall pass you may wonder why we should think this in the happiest times as well as sad won't that make me sad to know that the happy times will inevitably end you might ask but this recognition is not about being happy or sad it is about a deep and powerful understanding of the nature of our reality imagine the possibility that instead of struggling to achieve those fleeting moments of joy through the perfect convergence of circumstances that we have a means of finding an underlying contentment throughout all changes suddenly the labels of good or bad have less power over us we find ourselves afloat in a still and clear lake instead of fighting against of rough and inevitable tide you see this too shall pass means that we find true contentment in the ever-changing present and so with this in mind let's now allow ourselves to deeply focus on this concept continue to comfortably breathe and also recognize you're just moving gently in and out very naturally very calmly remember that stray thoughts or distractions are perfectly normal and all apart of this constant change therefore we do not fight against it but recognize it and brush it away and as we settle deeper into the state of contentment an acceptance of ever-present change let's retain those thoughts as we count slowly down starting at the number 5 by this too shall pass [Music] for clarity presence and stillness three this too shall pass to clarity peace and stillness [Music] one this too shall pass allow yourself to sit in this stillness for as long as you wish to continue taking a few moments just for you gentle relaxing breath the movement of the chest remembering the ever-present change of all things this too shall pass [Music] [Music] [Music]
0 [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is a meditation session on coping with physical pain our pain comes in many forms whether a temporary injury or a chronic condition it may be something that comes and goes or may be virtually continuous it also may be spread throughout a large area of our bodies or may be very focused and acute whatever the situation you can use this meditation to shape the experience to fit the kind of pain that you are experiencing also keep in mind that meditation should serve as just one of a number of approaches to dealing with pain including the possibility of physical therapy and natural remedies and dr. approved medication as we begin find as comfortable of a position as you can while also remaining alert and present in both body and mind you may choose to sit cross-legged on the floor and if that is a bit uncomfortable you can lean back on a wall or sit in a chair or even lie down if you are able to retain your focus and to begin just start to bring focus to your breathing and to your body start to take gentle and comfortable breaths inward and outward not forcing anything but just breathing naturally focusing on that breath calmly speaking to yourself each time in and end out bring awareness to the flow of the energy throughout your body [Music] realize just how rare it is that we focus on certain parts of ourselves unless we're feeling some kind of pain in that area yet we can bring attention to ourselves and our bodies at any time try bringing focus to the nerve endings of your toes and now feel that move up down your arms and into your fingertips may just feel that slight tingling sensation as you bring your focus there you can feel the surface of where you're sitting or leaning [Music] and since the feeling of the clothes that you're wearing can notice whether there's a presence of light in the room and where that's coming from and what it feels like you can feel your eyes or eyelids whether they're open or closed just becoming aware of yourself and everything around you [Music] and if you begin to focus enough you might even get the sense that you are not yourself apart from the rest of the world and the universe but you're just merging with it becoming one becoming one with it just being able to observe it and right now if your eyes remain open as you continue a calm pattern of breathing in and out you may wish to find a point of focus in the room again if your eyes are still open don't don't let them strain just softly focus and allow yourself to feel the weight of your eyelids start to grow not a weight like you're falling asleep but just a weight of heaviness of focus of being present in this moment feel that weight grow as you become more and more focused more and more aware and as you continue settling in you may be feeling your pain condition right now or be able to imagine how it feels when it happens your pain may cause you to become frustrated or angry or sad her pain for many people and many different ways a part of our life and it's in our nature to want nothing more than to avoid that pain and run away from it make it go away right now but for now let's just try something a bit different [Music] let's dive further into focus by having you repeat these short phrases after me whether out louder in your head just repeating slow breath so breath [Music] Kahn focused [Music] calm focused [Music] so breath [Music] calm focused calm focused [Music] calm focused aware now continue to allow yourself to sink in to that deep state of comfort yes we can maintain that until comfort even through the physical pain and retain that strong and welcoming focusing energy [Music] and now at this time I want you to bring your focus again to your pain if you're feeling it now or the feeling that arises when the pain becomes strong think of the part or parts of your body that feel that pain most intensely imagine the emotional feelings that it brings up in you when the pain is happening keep this in mind our goal is not to eliminate the pain completely but to bring ourselves to a better understanding of our pain to find a relationship with that vein [Music] and as we do so now allow for one number for each breath and count down count down with me just repeat there in your head or out loud [Music] slowly breathing and on your next breath five I recognize my pain five I recognize my pain for I am learning to understand my pain for I am learning to understand my pain [Music] three I recognize the emotions that arise from my pain three I recognize the emotions that arise from my pain [Music] - I acknowledge my pain [Music] - I acknowledge my pain one I am learning to understand my pain [Music] one I'm learning to understand my pain [Music] great job now as you continue to find even stronger focus and awareness than before you have not done so already I just want you to gently close your eyes you might have a long time ago now in the center of where you would be looking if your eyes were open imagine your pain in front of you see it and visualize it in any way that comes to mind for some it might be a fiery glowing orb or maybe a mass of thorns it might look angry or bright intimidating uninviting whatever you see bring all your focus and attention to that object [Music] bring that attention [Music] get very clear right in front of you and now again their attention focused repeat after me continuing to acutely see that ball of pain before you and follow the suggestions slowly breathing and counting and focusing five I see my pain [Music] or I see my pain shrinking away [Music] three I observe myself controlling my pain too I see my pain and one I see my pain shrinking away [Music] and let it shrink way away away [Music] excellent job right now your pain if you are presently feeling it maybe slightly better or it may be just the same either way it's fine what you are accomplishing is very important which is raising your awareness of your pain rather than letting your frustration sadness or anger take over in times that your pain worsens even might feel unbearable just return yourself to these thoughts I see my pain [Music] I see my pain I recognize my pain I recognize my pain I understand my pain I understand my pain [Music] now if you like just take another few moments slowly gently focusing on your breathing just allow yourself to gently come back out of this meditation remember you can bring yourself back whenever you feel the need to regain focus and give yourself a reminder relaxed awake endo air [Music] [Music] you

0 [Music] this is a guided mindfulness meditation on embracing happiness [Music] begin with your breath your constant gently in and out [Music] bring your presence into this moment arms relaxed gaze focused in the distance or eyes closed just allowing your body to be comfortable yet alert wherever you may be [Music] again focusing on natural gentle breaths in and out feeling the movement of air through your nostrils or your chest moving gently up and down [Music] if we open ourselves to being available for each passing moment and maximizing contentment in what we call the here and now we also open ourselves to the acceptance of happiness and contentment through this practice of being present being mindful and understanding the way that our mind works we recognize how often our thoughts and stresses can lead the mind astray digging into the depths of our subconscious [Music] and possibly with fear and angst the lingering on what is wrong rather than what is right and beautiful a place we can look is to what we can control within ourselves realizing that happiness itself cannot necessarily be forced or planned but if we orient ourselves toward contentment and presence we can find peace in the present moment and awaken to the renewed possibilities of each new day [Music] and so take this brief journey with me [Music] and in bringing ourselves into this place of energy focus continuing to recognize your breathing and your body here in this space just count along with me whether out loud or in your head [Music] reminding ourselves of breath and body each time going from five to one we start now five breath and body [Music] four breath and body [Music] three breath and body two breath and body [Music] and fully relaxed now with one breath and body [Music] as you are here in this peaceful state of awareness i ask you to think of a location that brings you great joy [Music] this could be a vacation destination or a childhood home it could be real or imagined very close by or very far away it could be associated with a joyful memory or simply have a wonderful and positive feeling [Music] take a moment to think about this place what emotions and feelings arise when you bring your focus to this place joy comfort a warm presence a longing perhaps a desire whatever you feel is okay embrace these feelings welcome them and observe them to understand what it might mean to have these thoughts about this place and ponder why those thoughts arose and as you embrace this focus we will repeat some affirmations you can repeat these again either out loud or in your head and just repeat slowly after me [Music] relaxed and present open to joy [Music] embracing comforting thoughts mind calm and free i surrender to this perfect moment [Music] awesome now in our next exercise we will now focus on thoughts of a loved companion it could be a family member or friend it could also be a favorite pet [Music] it could be someone who you see every day there's someone or something who is very far away [Music] just think of that meaningful presence in your life realize what thoughts of them come into your emotions just as with the place that you focused on it may bring joy comfort into warm presence and may even bring up other feelings such as melancholy nostalgia or even sadness [Music] if what you're thinking of happens to be far away or not here anymore these or any other emotions they are all okay because you are recognizing them you are aware of them so remember to embrace them welcome them observe them coming to an understanding of what it means to have these thoughts as you think about this companion [Music] and as you do so bring them into your focus and let's repeat these same affirmations once again again bringing that focus to the companion in your mind repeating after me relaxed and present open to joy embracing comforting thoughts mind calm and free [Music] i surrender to this perfect moment [Music] great take this place you embrace and this companion you embrace and allow them to help bring you into the present moment day by day hour by hour at the end of this session just allow yourself a few minutes [Music] to continue to stay in this presence and [Music] give yourself a bit of time to continue practicing presence and mindfulness remember that our lives are full of forces ups and downs high expectations uncertainty yet if we remain aware of what we most desire to embrace our favorite places our best companions surround yourself with this presence of feeling and you will solely but surely [Music] discover a deep and beautiful subconscious contentment which can lead to the to moment-to-moment happiness that we so desperately crave [Music] that sometimes feels so fleeting [Music] remember this and take it with you into the days and weeks ahead [Music] so again taking these last few moments to deeply understand and recognize these lessons [Music] we count down slowly now from five to one five four [Music] three two one [Music] to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you

0 This is an extended body scan meditation. A body scan is a highly effective technique for bringing a sense of harmony between your mind and body. This session will help to keep¬† you calm, present, and relaxed. Go ahead and find your favorite position in order for us to get started. Just settle in, and maybe even give your arms a quick shake, or gently rotate your neck a few times just to get yourself comfortable. And as we always do, begin to bring your attention to your breathing. Remember: naturally in and out, feeling that gentle movement of your chest. Also remembering to keep your back straight and shoulders just slightly pulled back. And as you bring yourself¬† into this present moment, I invite you to set aside the past and not think about the future. Right now, the only goal is to be right here, right now. The movement of your breath and the sound of my voice. Just repeat these words after me" "Here in this moment." "Peaceful and present." And once more: "Here in this moment." "Peaceful and present." Great. And now we are ready to begin the body scan. As we do this, you may feel various sensations¬† throughout your body. This shows just the kind of powerful¬† connection your mind has with your body. Welcome these and continue to follow along. Begin with a focus at the very top of your head. Bring your attention there and¬† relax the muscles in your eyes. Using each time you breathe out to bring an added release of tension. And as you relax those muscles in your eyes, feel that relaxing energy moves¬† slowly down into your jaw. Notice if you are clenching or tight. And as that energy moves, I like to¬† imagine this flow as a glowing light, or the flow of water as it moves down. Notice any places that you¬† are possibly creating tension0 even where you didn't notice it before. Now feel that slow energy move down¬† through your neck and shoulders. Just releasing all of that tension. Letting go of any remaining tightness. And then it slowly moves down into your arms. Imagine that relaxing energy¬† slowly moving up your arms. And then continuing down¬† through your chest and torso. And with your next breath, just allow all of that tension in your¬† upper body to release even further. Letting go of any of that remaining tightness. Just full focus on your relaxed body and muscles. Let that imagined glow or flow of water feel and remain ever-present. And now we'll continue on down into your legs, ,just the same allowing those muscles to relax, and then relax even further. You are remaining alert, but your body is feeling so¬† free of that remaining tension. And as this happens, finally, let it move into your feet and all the way out the tips of your toes. Now imagining your body bathed in that warm glow, here in the present moment. Just spend a few more moments enjoying this. Remember, this is your time to¬† be here in the present moment. Focused and relaxed here and now. And now, you will prepare to come out of this meditation and back to your day. But you will retain those relaxed muscles and that sense of peace and presence¬† throughout the rest of your day. And this concludes today's session. Have a wonderful day and thank you for¬† listening to Mindful Peace Journey.

And as you relax those muscles in your eyes, feel that relaxing energy moves¬† slowly down into your jaw. Notice if you are clenching or tight. And as that energy moves, I like to¬† imagine this flow as a glowing light, or the flow of water as it moves down. Notice any places that you¬† are possibly creating tension0 even where you didn't notice it before. Now feel that slow energy move down¬† through your neck and shoulders. Just releasing all of that tension. Letting go of any remaining tightness. And then it slowly moves down into your arms. Imagine that relaxing energy¬† slowly moving up your arms. And then continuing down¬† through your chest and torso. And with your next breath, just allow all of that tension in your¬† upper body to release even further. Letting go of any of that remaining tightness. Just full focus on your relaxed body and muscles. Let that imagined glow or flow of water feel and remain ever-present. And now we'll continue on down into your legs, ,just the same allowing those muscles to relax, and then relax even further. You are remaining alert, but your body is feeling so¬† free of that remaining tension. And as this happens, finally, let it move into your feet and all the way out the tips of your toes. Now imagining your body bathed in that warm glow, here in the present moment. Just spend a few more moments enjoying this. Remember, this is your time to¬† be here in the present moment. Focused and relaxed here and now. And now, as I count down slowly from five to one, you will prepare to come out of this meditation and back to your day. But you will retain those relaxed muscles and that sense of peace and presence¬† throughout the rest of your day. Counting down now: Five. Four Three. Two. One. And now, if you like, spend just a few more minutes in¬† this place of peace and comfort listening to the ambient sound. And this concludes today's session. Have a wonderful day and thank you for¬† listening to Mindful Peace Journey.
0 - [John] Hi, I'm John and I'm so glad you're joining me for this meditation to help you start your day. (gentle relaxed music) Our subconscious mind is most active and, some say, most impressionable right after we wake up. This gives us a tremendous opportunity to impact how the rest of our day plays out. We can set a positively focused intention that's in alignment with and supports the type of day we'd like to have. So to get started, get into a position you can comfortably hold for a bit. If you are doing this meditation shortly after waking up be sure you're not in a position you'd otherwise fall back to sleep in. Gently close your eyes. Begin to take deep, refreshing breaths. Allowing each breath to ease you into a still, focused state. Turning all of your attention inward. Making yourself your first priority in this moment. Your only focus is your wellbeing. As you continue to breathe this way, notice the journey of your breath through your body, how it feels as it weaves in and out of your cells, muscles and joints. Feeling the groundedness and connectedness in these areas. (soft relaxing music) Allowing the breath to ease and release any tightness or tension you may be feeling. Be aware of any judgments that might come up as you do this. It's natural for this to happen, so instead of judging the judgment, simply acknowledge that it's there and then let it drift away. Replacing it with loving thoughts for how your body will support you through this day too. (gentle relaxed music continues) Now that we've grounded physically, let's focus on our internal intention for the day. Most of the time when we think of intention, we think about the thing we want to get or experience. But what's fascinating is that most often we don't actually want the thing, we want the way to think makes us feel. So begin to focus now on how you'd like to feel today. It can be tempting in this process to focus on what you don't want. So if you notice yourself doing that, it's okay. Simply let that pass and then refocus on what you do want. Perhaps you want a day filled with ease, peace, joy, and flow. Tap into the feelings you want to experience today. And as you do, allow yourself time with each one, sitting in that feeling, allow it to fill up your entire body and heart. (gentle relaxed music continues)# (calm music) Now, how do you want to feel when the day is done? Perhaps you want to feel accomplished, productive, energized, or satisfied. Again, focus on what you do want. And as you do, allow yourself time with each one, sitting in each feeling, allowing it to fill your entire body and heart. Now open yourself up to allowing this intention to settle into your unconscious so that your thoughts and actions for the rest of the day today can be in alignment. (relaxed music) Continue breathing with your eyes closed. Just let your attention start to focus back on my voice. Allow yourself to be guided by this intention today. Allow it to show you new possibilities you may not have seen before and guide your actions. Allow it to inspire the journey of your day with curiosity and maybe even a bit of playfulness. Now let's take three more deep breaths together. Take a deep inhale in, holding it for a beat and exhale it out. Again, an even deeper breath than the one before. Feeling it weave in and out of your muscles and cells. And exhale it out. Last time, your deepest breath yet. Sending that oxygen through your entire body and solidifying once again, your intention for the day. And when that breath reaches the top of your head and you're ready, you can open your eyes. Thanks so much for joining me for this meditation. I'm excited for the day you're about to have.
