Namaste
friends
I
‚Äô
glad
There
cartoon
came
right
Christmas
The
caption
‚Äú
Tree
trauma
‚Äù
see
disturbed
Christmas
tree
lying
psychiatrist
's
couch
tree
saying
‚Äú
Well
turns
gifts
‚Äô
‚Äù
And
I
loved
And
I
thought
I
‚Äô
share
bit
lead
theme
We
going
exploring
‚Äô
called
trauma-sensitive
mindfulness
And
I
‚Äô
like
begin
saying
early
days
meditation
practice
uniform
mindfulness
guidance
‚Äú
If
something
strong
comes
‚Äù
know
‚Äú
Lean
fear
‚Äù
know
‚Äú
Bring
gentle
clear
mindful
attention
whatever
arises.
‚Äù
And
worked
pretty
well
But
I
found
later
people
lot
fear
trauma
could
amplify
fear
ways
sometimes
felt
overwhelming
And
people
experienced
panic
stopped
meditating
What
‚Äô
understand
calling
‚Äú
trauma-sensitive
mindfulness
mindfulness
needs
adapted
flexibility
sensitivity
care
best
serve
living
PTSD
well
anyone
‚Äô
feeling
moment
potentially
overwhelming
emotions
So
talk
want
deepen
understanding
territory
I
‚Äô
like
encourage
read
David
Treleaven
‚Äô
book
‚Äú
Trauma-sensitive
therapy
‚Äù
‚Äô
resources
website
So
‚Äô
discuss
PTSD
strong
fear
arises
may
times
really
‚Äô
wise
lean
And
way
illustration
Peter
Levine
leader
responding
trauma
uses
Medusa
myth
illustrate
know
Medusa
monster
venomous
snake
hair
anyone
looks
face
immobilized
know
freeze
turn
stone
So
Perseus
Greek
hero
advised
Athena
‚Äì
goddess
wisdom
tells
look
directly
Medusa
use
shield
way
reflect
gaze
allow
enter
cave
slay
demon
So
point
sometimes
directly
face
contact
suffering
times
need
actually
shift
attention
case
meditation
need
find
ways
soothing
sympathetic
nervous
system
know
self-soothing
‚Äô
activated
words
need
learn
nurture
So
‚Äô
going
return
But
I
want
name
talk
really
us
many
experienced
trauma
experience
times
emotionally
overwhelmed
feels
like
‚Äô
going
much
need
way
calm
come
back
balance
So
whether
healing
PTSD
less
severe
suffering
wounded
relationship
need
relationship
healing
crucial
part
relationship
relate
inner
life
domain
meditation
Meditation
really
essential
deep
authentic
healing
And
one
last
times
I
taught
weekend
retreat
life
retreat
I
remember
woman
standing
front
I
think
three-hundred
people
said
‚Äú
I
‚Äô
decades
PTSD
therapy
And
‚Äô
I
introduced
meditation
eight
years
ago
‚Äù
said
‚Äú
I
finally
found
inner
refuge.
‚Äù
I
‚Äô
heard
many
people
And
key
thing
share
‚Äì
common
theme
‚Äì
place
trauma
transforms
gateway
spiritual
healing
wound
becomes
entry
And
might
remember
Lenard
Cohen
saying
‚Äú
In
broken
places
light
shines
through.
‚Äù
So
trauma
painful
also
place
reconnect
sense
sacred
soul
spirit
sense
fearless
heart
So
I
‚Äô
starting
purpose
‚Äô
possible
much
painful
emotions
‚Äô
extreme
full
trauma
something
‚Äô
wish
lives
That
intensity
really
become
domain
spiritual
awakening
learn
pay
attention
So
I
‚Äô
seen
‚Äì
us
‚Äì
practice
mindfulness
needs
customized
And
different
bodies
minds
need
different
days
need
flexibility
work
instructions
‚Äô
given
This
especially
true
trauma
And
emphasis
needs
trauma
first
creating
enough
sense
safety
‚Äô
possible
really
full
presence
So
‚Äô
cover
‚Äô
look
background
suffering
trauma
‚Äô
look
particular
strategies
help
customize
mindfulness
self-resourcing
really
healing
comes
open
wholeness
So
way
background
trauma
live
know
I
could
ask
hand
raise
‚Äú
How
many
either
know
trauma
personally
body-mind
know
someone
close
dealing
trauma
‚Äù
Most
everyone
would
raise
hand
trauma
widespread
similarly
PTSD
‚Äì
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
‚Äì
‚Äô
prevalent
collective
psyche
especially
admit
global
poli
crisis
‚Äô
‚Äô
living
The
writer
Carol
Patterson
describes
us
‚Äú
PTSD
society.
‚Äù
And
signs
traumatized
society
Disconnection
earth
bodies
violation
earth
cruelty
aggression
towards
fellow
beings
addiction
spread
whole
globe
polarization
fragmentation
breakdown
communication
parts‚Ä¶
These
signs
trauma
And
think
collectively
also
individual
body
And
feels
really
important
recognize
people
non-dominant
groups
face
ongoing
threats
conditions
make
vulnerable
experiencing
trauma
including
generational
trauma
experiencing
And
identities
‚Äì
non-dominant
identities
‚Äì
include
race
religion
ethnicity
social
class
sexual
orientation
indigenous
heritage
national
origin
gender
disability‚Ä¶
So
many
And
dominant
groups
‚Äô
hard
remember
recognize
different
backgrounds
identities
actually
experiencing
And
I
feel
like
Resmaa
Menakem
important
voice
And
uses
language
‚Äú
black
bodies
feel
endangered
potentially
traumatized
whites.
‚Äù
He
describes
centuries
currently
white
bodies
countless
times
violent
black
bodies
reverse
killing
lynching
raping
And
sharing
white
people
often
forget
much
trauma
Falkner
says
clearly
says
‚Äú
The
past
dead
It
even

‚Äù
And
means
Situations
white
people
‚Äô
register

actually
And
I
think

children
goes
bit
put
line
Not
sure
feeding
family
Paying
rent
I
think
global
north
know
climate
events
really
disturbing
still
‚Äô
quite
recognize
devastation
climate
change
really
many
countries
Pakistan
one
third
water
last
year
Filipinas
Bangladesh
I
think
droughts
famine
Africa
Chad
Kenya
Somalia
This
livelihood
‚Äô
life
So
I
took
little
time
huge
trauma
non-dominant
populations
realize
much
around
globe
staggering
mind
And
course
addition
collective
causes
trauma
many
us
go
traumatic
events
personal
life
womb
upbringing
accidents
sickness
surgeries
abuse
sudden
losses‚Ä¶
You
know
two
thirds
children
reported
least
one
traumatic
event
age
sixteen
So
difference
trauma
PTSD
‚Äì
simplified
‚Äì
trauma
arises
situations
nervous
system
overwhelmed
normal
coping
strategies
‚Äô
work
PTSD
arises
inability
process
integrate
trauma
larger
body-mind
So
people
trauma
process
PTSD
others
‚Äô
And
example
Let
‚Äô
say
someone
sexually
abused
young
child
happens
repeatedly
unpredictably
And
severed
belonging
safety
larger
container
trustworthy
available
adult
could
way
make
possible
healing
processing
So
trauma
living
body
‚Äú
The
issues
tissues
‚Äù
say
And
‚Äô
easily
triggered
Any
sign
danger
violation
abandonment
activates
acute
stress
And
happens
This
means
parts
brain
evolved
monitor
danger
activated
chronically
on-button
jammed
regular
secretion
cortisol
toxic
neurons
It
damages
connections
needed
parts

‚Äô

I
find
useful
way

Dan

This

‚Äù
But
happens
‚Äô
chronically

‚Äô

get

flip

And
flip

So
hijack

We
‚Äô
essentially

And
‚Äô
interesting
consider

others
receive

feel

temporarily
turn

shut
defensive

‚Äô
flipped

And
yet
often
partially

reaction
cut

caught

Even

One
favorite
examples
mom

But
‚Äô
able

And

And
feels
really

announces
‚Äú
Okay

‚Äù
And
son

Inside

Again

And

Takes

sweetie
I

‚Äù
And
looks
tear-streaked
voice
says
quite
calmly
‚Äú
Okay
mama

‚Äù
We
go

Partial

whether
‚Äô

And
I
mentioned
‚Äô
threatened
‚Äô

whether
‚Äô

And
friends
suffering

‚Äô
really

deep

So
bringing
meditation
might
consider
triggered
intense
way
reactive
fight-flight-freeze
cut
outside

tolerance
able
tolerate
‚Äô
arising
us
term
‚Äú
window
tolerance
‚Äù
Dan
Siegel
‚Äì
psychologist
author
podcast
‚Äì
know
describes
window
tolerance
brain
integrated
get
triggered
flip
lid
leave
window
tolerance
‚Äô
either
caught
fight-flight
strong
unpleasant
emotions
instructions
mindfulness
fight

feel
‚Äô
going
‚Äô
sense
overwhelm
Or
freeze
kind
rigidity
dissociation
still
outside
window
tolerance
numbing
‚Äô
feel

often
instructions
mindfulness
‚Äú
Feel
‚Äô
going
inside
body
‚Äù
yet
sense

So
thing
The
classical
instructions
meditation
tell
us
feel
feelings
fight-flight-freeze
either
feeling
much
feels
overwhelming
unable
feel
And
either
way
sense
way
able
feel
meditation
failing
meditation
And
outside
window
really
cut
unable
So
I
‚Äô
like
take
moments
look
primary
suffering
happens
‚Äô
triggered
either
dissociation
triggered
hyper-sensitivity
strong

And
primary
suffering
shame
shame
‚Äô
going
And
I
‚Äô
like
share

might
remember
I
felt
really
illustrated
power
traumatic

surround
work
So
many
years
ago
I
working
woman
sexually
physically

‚Äô
‚Äò
You

‚Äô
The

She
waved

‚Äô
‚Äù
So
I
shared
story
talk
I
gave
‚Äì
course
gave
permission
‚Äì
talk
many
lined
talk
And
sharings
similar
One
person
put
clearly
said
‚Äú
I
‚Äô
always
ashamed
addiction
conflictual
relationships
rage
shutting
listening
I
realized
‚Äô
fault
I
trying
control
trauma
I
‚Äô
better
way.
‚Äù
And
said
‚Äú
I
‚Äô
better
way.
‚Äù
And
sense
relief
glimmering
self-forgiveness
And
many
something
similar
could
get
best
could
time
sense
hope
possibility
But
needed
forgive
first
I
remember
similar
way
man
I
worked
years
ago
Company
downsized
got
laid
tried
years
tried
everything
get
job
‚Äô
descended
panic
depression
sleeplessness
know
taking
anxiety
medication
withdrew
people
really
avoided
people
marriage
falling
apart
really
filled
shame
And
I
remember
working
finally
point
saying
‚Äú
This
trauma
And
‚Äô
fault.
‚Äù
And
something
cracked
open
He
started
weeping
It
beginning
self-compassion
beginning
healing
And
gradually
reached
friends
joined
men
‚Äô
group
started
reengaging
path
healing
Trauma
universal
response
endangerment
powerless
symptoms
PTSD
trauma
‚Äô
processed
It
‚Äô
universal
And
starts
release
shame
kind
cellular
realizing
‚Äú
It
‚Äô
fault
‚Äù
‚Äô
fault
get
traumatized
‚Äô

‚Äô
unable
process
trauma
‚Äô
fault
nervous
system
reacts
anxiety
depression
‚Äô
fault
behaviors
aimed
controlling

coping

And
realization
woman
wrote
story
fairy
‚Äì
intelligent
shut
feelings
much
handle
‚Äì
coping
strategies
followed
way
eating
way
controlling
body
experience
avoiding

best
could
So
I
‚Äô
spending
time
trauma
shame
‚Äô
asking
attention
healing
And
I
extend
say
With
deep
emotional
wounding
‚Äì
neglect
criticism
trail
rejection
‚Äì
somewhere
deep
feel
‚Äô
fault
‚Äô
ashamed
way
wounding
affects
personality
behaviors
think
different
If
recognize
shame
dedicate
releasing
‚Äì
‚Äú
It
‚Äô
fault
‚Äù
‚Äì
‚Äô
possible
bring
healing
directly
place
trauma
woundedness
begin
open
Let
‚Äô
pause
reflect
moment
You
might
consider
might
living
generational
trauma
early
trauma
wounds
lack
good
nurturing
words
poor
attachment
‚Äì
bonding
know
might
experience
trauma
outside
window
tolerance
develop
coping
strategies
work
‚Äô
going
inside
‚Äì
maybe
dissociating
body
maybe
anger
addictive
behaviors
avoidance
real
intimacy
neediness
co-dependency
So
check
see
might
life
‚Äô
presented
Trauma
reaction
trauma
And
honestly
check
sense
Have
felt
shame
woundedness
Have
felt
shame
ways
tried
protect
feeling
much
And
explore
might
put
hand
heart
aware
‚Äô
going
inside
places
self-judgment
shame
let
places
judgment
come
right
foreground
And
might
explore
happens
say
kindness
‚Äú
It
‚Äô
fault.
‚Äù
And
helps
might
imagine
someone
trust
love
one
say
‚Äú
It
‚Äô
fault.
‚Äù
I
invite
hear
let
‚Äô
hard
let
message
pray
let
Again
fairy
story
‚Äú
‚Äô
You
‚Äô
love
enough
heal
‚Äô
older
life
powerful
full

One
day
know
really
You
trust
goodness
belonging
Until
always
I
love
you.
‚Äô
‚Äù
If
eyes
closed
might
open
In
many
shamanistic
cultures
process
reconnecting
‚Äì
releasing
shame
processing
trauma
‚Äì
‚Äô
called
soul
retrieval
And
‚Äô
believed
person
traumatized
soul
leaves
body
way
protecting
intolerable
pain
And
process
soul
retrieval
traumatized
person
held
love
safety
community
soul
invited
return
I
like
description
I
‚Äô
heard
many
heal
trauma
describe
recovering
sense
soul
spirit
recovering
sense
dimensions
sacred
live
cut
And
likewise
healing
contexts
care‚Ä¶
one
‚Äô
community
‚Äì
care
therapists
friends
teacher
might
initially
provide
safety
reconnect
degree
authentic
presence
well-being
inside
We
need
I
always
think
little
story
‚Äô
stormy
night
child
calls
parents
scared
thunder
And
father
goes
says
‚Äú
It
‚Äô
okay
You
trust
God
you.
‚Äù
And
child
little
leaves
room
child
starts
whaling
father
comes
back
reassures
know
‚Äú
God
you.
‚Äù
And
leaves
room
And
finally
child
crying
comes
back
child
says
‚Äú
You
know
I
know
God
I
want
someone
skin
on.
‚Äù
So
I
love
need
interpersonal
need
relational
support
healing
trauma
cut
feeling
And
‚Äô
talking
also
relationship
inner
life
And
‚Äô
‚Äô
cultivating
I
often
think
psychologist
Luis
Cozolino
says
‚Äú
It
‚Äô
survival

‚Äô
survival
nurtured.
‚Äù
So
last
part
‚Äô
exploring
self-nurturing
comes
facets
meditation
exactly
need
exactly
need
process
healing
trauma
And
need
enough
access

partly

Every

And
‚Äô

In

Once

And

This

‚Äô
able

Just
kind
loop

This

woman
She
would
call

And
‚Äô
go

And

Bit

And
found

Similarly
woman
I
brought
‚Äì
bringing

‚Äì
able
quickly
come

The
fears

So
I
want
step
back
friends
say
This
archetypal
process
like
Perseus
first
need
redirect
attention
find
‚Äì
case
I
describing
kind
self-nurturing
increases
sense
safety
‚Äì
back
inside
window
tolerance
‚Äì
overwhelmed
‚Äì
begin
open
old

So
I
‚Äô
like
close
practice
And
guided
meditation
offers
pathway
inner
resources
face
intense
emotion
I
‚Äô
like
invite
find
comfortable

whatever
position
allows
feel
safe

If
helps
begin
collect

Feel
earth

Your

could
open

And
scan
see
life
brings

brings

‚Äì
could

In

So
take

Allows

Might

Great
