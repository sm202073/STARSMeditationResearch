Hey
welcome
meditation
help
reduce
anxiety
First
I
'd
like
invite
gently
close
eyes
take
nice
slow
deep
breath
deeper
've
taken
day
far
And
exhale
concentrate
sound
voice
allowing
ground
present
moment
giving
permission
right
focus
making
first
priority
There
nowhere
else
need
There
nothing
else
need
For
next
several
minutes
wellbeing
focus
Continue
take
slow
deep
breaths
allowing
inhale
bit
deeper
one
Feeling
lungs
expand
inhale
holding
beat
contracting
back
exhale
And
continue
breathe
way
feel
journey
breath
body
notice
places
may
holding
stress
anxiety
body
Unfurl
brow
unclench
jaw
Let
shoulders
drop
ears
Open
palms
And
allow
breath
return
normal
rhythm
pattern
keep
focus
allow
anchor
meditation
If
get
distracted
thought
sound
simply
acknowledge
occurred
gently
let
go
return
attention
breath
When
're
stressed
anxious
something
's
often
n't
feel
control
sense
control
make
us
feel
less
safe
emotions
heighten
An
understandable
reaction
try
control
situation
even
We
also
tend
judge
situation
even
feelings
Those
judgments
stories
tell
often
become
bigger
situation
adds
even
stress
cycle
repeats
So
right
I
invite
call
mind
situation
feel
causing
anxiety
What
judgments
holding
As
name
judgment
acknowledge
presence
Now
give
judgment
permission
drop
away
You
n't
need
anymore
Let
go
And
's
story
've
telling
situation
As
recognize
acknowledge
presence
give
story
permission
drop
away
well
You
may
notice
mind
pushing
even
harder
hold
onto
judgments
stories
Recognize
acknowledge
thoughts
allow
drop
away
well
Continue
use
breath
anchor
back
present
moment
get
distracted
Now
let
's
look
situation
without
judgment
story
telling
How
feel
different
Has
level
anxiety
stress
changed
Instead
I
invite
look
situation
total
curiosity
Now
move
silent
part
meditation
give
permission
open
clarity
direction
next
step
take
Not
next
five
10
steps
steps
end
next
step
And
continue
breathing
eyes
closed
Just
let
attention
start
focus
back
voice
Our
judgments
stories
tell
situation
tend
exaggerate
feelings
unease
anxiety
stress
They
skew
's
actually
going
proportion
block
us
seeing
truth
situation
allowing
ease
comfort
desire
So
next
time
're
feeling
anxious
remember
breathe
notice
acknowledge
judgements
story
behind
And
let
drop
away
notice
anxiousness
eases
Focus
truth

You
everything
need
right
Now
let

Again

Last
