hello
welcome
to
today
's
gentle
movement
practice
for
relieving
stress
and
anxiety
i
'm
sarah
raymond
with
the
mindful
movement
so
just
a
quick
overview
of
what
we
're
going
to
be
doing
today
primarily
it
's
going
to
be
seated
so
you
can
be
seated
in
a
chair
or
on
the
floor
even
on
a
couch
whatever
is
comfortable
for
you
and
then
the
second
half
will
be
a
little
bit
on
the
floor
so
if
you're
comfortable
coming
down
onto
the
floor
with
me
you
'll
join
me
if
not
then
you
just
participate
in
the
front
first
half
of
the
practice
so
we
'll
start
with
a
little
bit
of
breathing
and
then
some
gentle
self-massage
techniques
to
bring
some
awareness
to
different
body
parts
when
you
might
be
feeling
anxious
and
need
a
little
bit
of
grounding
and
then
some
gentle
stretches
to
open
up
the
area
that
allows
you
to
deepen
your
breath
and
find
a
little
bit
more
ease
if
you
are
experiencing
stress
or
anxiety
so
let
's
get
right
to
it
so
come
to
any
comfortable
seated
position
and
we
'll
start
with
a
four
seven
eight
breath
so
it
's
an
inhale
through
your
nose
for
four
counts
a
hold
for
up
to
seven
if
you
do
n't
feel
comfortable
with
seven
then
you
can
do
a
shorter
hold
and
then
it
's
a
slow
exhale
through
your
nose
for
eight
counts
and
i
'll
count
you
through
the
first
two
and
then
we
'll
practice
a
little
bit
on
our
own
so
again
finding
any
comfortable
seated
posture
tall
lifted
spine
shoulders
relaxed
and
down
maybe
close
your
eyes
if
you
'd
like
and
then
exhale
fully
as
a
preparation
breathe
in
two
three
four
hold
two
three
four
five
six
seven
breathe
out
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
again
breathe
in
two
three
four
hold
two
three
four
five
six
seven
breathe
out
two
three
four
five
6
7
8
now
continue
on
your
own
so
finish
one
more
cycle
on
your
own
and
then
allow
your
breath
to
return
to
its
normal
rhythm
normal
depth
and
flow
and
then
next
we
'll
take
three
deep
inhales
through
the
nose
and
this
time
as
you
exhale
create
an
audible
sigh
so
do
that
two
more
times
let
your
body
soften
and
relax
with
each
exhale
blink
your
eyes
open
if
they
were
closed
okay
so
next
we
're
going
to
move
on
to
as
i
said
some
self
massage
techniques
i
'll
take
my
glasses
off
here
so
we
'll
start
with
the
facial
massage
and
you
're
just
putting
a
gentle
pressure
does
n't
have
to
be
significant
you
can
use
your
fingers
or
if
you
have
a
tiny
little
ball
that
might
work
too
but
you
're
basically
finding
the
bones
in
your
face
and
pressing
on
the
bones
and
you
might
just
press
along
the
bones
or
you
can
press
and
gently
pull
either
outward
downward
upward
whatever
feels
like
it
's
the
most
effective
for
you
we
're
not
going
to
spend
a
ton
of
time
here
you
can
again
close
your
eyes
if
you
like
and
go
against
your
nose
at
the
cheekbone
above
your
eye
eyebrow
i
should
say
above
your
eyebrow
your
forehead
and
then
i
like
to
spend
a
good
bit
of
time
right
at
around
the
jaw
so
it
's
pretty
much
in
line
with
where
your
ear
is
so
you
can
find
them
there
's
a
bone
on
the
top
and
a
bone
on
the
bottom
and
then
there
's
a
little
indentation
and
you
can
press
there
and
open
and
close
your
jaw
and
then
go
around
the
jaw
and
then
you
would
just
of
course
do
the
same
on
the
other
side
and
if
there
's
any
areas
that
feel
particularly
sore
you
might
just
stay
there
and
take
a
few
deep
breaths
and
like
we
practiced
earlier
when
your
exhale
is
longer
than
your
inhale
it
can
have
a
little
bit
of
a
relaxing
effect
relaxing
effect
for
you
you
'll
start
to
find
the
areas
that
feel
like
you
need
to
spend
the
most
time
there
and
you
can
always
just
explore
there
so
again
find
the
jaw
hinge
of
the
jaw
open
and
close
okay
and
if
there
's
anywhere
that
you
feel
like
you
need
to
spend
a
little
bit
more
time
you
can
do
that
otherwise
we
'll
move
on
to
our
neck
so
you
can
use
both
hands
or
one
at
a
time
your
choice
you
'll
feel
just
behind
the
ears
the
bone
start
there
and
then
start
to
work
your
way
down
and
you
can
even
go
to
this
upper
trapezius
area
so
the
top
of
your
neck
and
shoulders
and
then
let
me
show
you
from
the
back
you
're
going
to
take
one
hand
on
either
side
of
your
neck
so
on
either
side
of
your
spine
i
should
say
and
then
think
of
pulling
outward
and
as
you
do
gently
let
your
head
drop
back
and
then
come
back
up
again
so
you
'll
go
through
that
a
few
times
right
starting
right
at
the
base
of
the
skull
and
then
working
your
way
down
and
then
after
you
do
that
a
few
times
you
can
um
i
like
actually
do
this
with
the
opposite
hand
so
the
muscle
right
at
the
top
of
your
shoulder
you
'll
grab
with
your
opposite
hand
squeeze
up
draw
your
shoulder
up
towards
your
ear
and
then
just
release
down
squeeze
up
and
release
down
one
more
time
on
the
side
and
then
we
can
switch
sides
so
as
you
squeeze
that
muscle
lift
your
shoulder
up
and
release
and
all
the
time
continuing
to
breathe
fluidly
good
okay
and
then
last
bit
of
self
massage
will
be
the
area
of
your
chest
so
if
you
can
find
your
collarbone
at
the
top
of
your
chest
you
're
going
to
go
just
below
the
collarbone
and
you
'll
just
give
a
little
bit
of
pressure
you
can
push
in
and
then
pull
down
gently
and
as
you
pull
down
you
might
explore
turning
your
head
in
the
opposite
direction
so
you
feel
a
little
bit
of
stretch
through
maybe
the
neck
at
least
so
my
my
left
side
is
always
a
little
bit
tighter
especially
at
the
neck
here
so
i
know
i
need
that
and
then
you
might
go
down
a
little
bit
below
the
collarbone
if
that
feels
okay
for
you
and
we
'll
do
the
other
side
so
finding
the
collarbone
right
below
press
in
and
feel
free
to
either
tip
your
head
towards
the
opposite
shoulder
or
turn
your
head
towards
the
opposite
shoulder
maybe
again
go
down
a
little
bit
below
the
collarbone
okay
and
that
will
be
all
of
our
self
massage
today
so
next
we
'll
start
to
do
some
very
gentle
stretches
so
again
you
can
remain
in
any
comfortable
seated
position
arms
by
your
sides
and
then
we
'll
stretch
through
our
neck
here
so
you
can
begin
by
tipping
your
right
ear
towards
your
right
shoulder
i
'll
mirror
you
here
and
as
you
're
tipping
your
head
to
your
right
think
about
drawing
your
left
shoulder
down
away
from
your
ear
and
then
you
'll
draw
your
chin
towards
your
right
collarbone
and
then
you
can
either
stay
here
with
your
chin
towards
your
collarbone
or
go
back
to
chin
forward
whatever
feels
comfortable
and
then
take
your
left
arm
out
just
um
above
the
height
of
your
hip
i
would
say
turn
your
palm
forward
and
then
you
're
moving
from
your
wrist
so
you
'll
draw
your
fingers
backwards
and
forwards
a
few
times
be
gentle
here
there
's
no
need
to
be
aggressive
with
these
stretches
and
then
just
allow
your
arm
to
relax
down
draw
your
chin
toward
your
chest
slowly
and
then
your
head
comes
back
up
and
we
'll
do
the
same
on
the
other
side
so
nice
and
gentle
tip
your
left
ear
towards
your
left
shoulder
encouraging
your
right
shoulder
to
stay
down
and
then
turn
your
chin
you
can
see
i
'm
moving
very
slowly
to
make
sure
i
do
n't
go
too
far
too
fast
chin
towards
the
left
collarbone
and
then
as
we
start
to
add
the
movement
from
the
arm
you
can
again
either
keep
your
chin
down
or
tip
it
forward
but
you
're
still
bringing
your
ear
towards
your
shoulder
and
then
we
lift
uh
let
's
see
this
is
your
right
arm
out
to
the
side
just
a
little
higher
than
your
hip
and
then
palm
facing
forward
as
you
move
from
the
wrist
fingers
go
back
and
fingers
forward
and
you
might
start
to
notice
if
you're
tensing
up
through
the
neck
this
might
be
too
high
so
bring
your
arm
down
or
make
the
movement
from
your
wrist
a
little
smaller
and
then
relax
your
hand
down
slowly
draw
your
chin
toward
your
chest
and
just
letting
your
head
hang
here
for
a
moment
take
a
breath
in
and
out
and
then
slowly
bringing
your
head
back
up
all
right
and
then
from
here
a
couple
spine
stretches
so
we
'll
lift
your
left
arm
drawing
your
shoulder
down
and
think
about
lifting
up
tall
and
at
the
same
time
grounding
down
and
then
gently
side
bending
over
to
your
right
and
now
we
'll
start
to
add
some
movement
but
i
want
you
to
try
to
focus
on
keeping
your
left
sit
bone
heavy
on
the
ground
so
as
you
turn
your
shoulders
forward
towards
the
floor
you
're
not
lifting
that
right
uh
the
right
side
of
your
butt
up
and
then
come
back
to
center
and
turn
your
chest
towards
the
ceiling
and
center
now
we
'll
keep
doing
that
movement
you
're
going
to
bring
your
eyes
to
focus
on
your
top
hand
and
then
we'll
follow
the
hand
so
you
're
looking
forward
as
your
shoulders
rotate
forward
looking
back
towards
the
ceiling
and
then
behind
you
one
more
time
rotating
forward
looking
forward
rotating
back
and
come
through
center
and
back
up
again
all
right
maybe
roll
your
shoulders
around
a
few
times
and
we
'll
do
the
other
side
so
lift
your
right
arm
again
lift
tall
first
and
root
down
through
the
pelvis
and
then
we
side
bend
over
so
as
i
said
my
left
side
is
always
a
little
tighter
so
i
have
to
remind
myself
to
draw
that
shoulder
down
easy
in
the
neck
and
then
begin
to
rotate
shoulders
forward
and
back
and
now
adding
the
eyes
so
looking
up
at
your
top
hand
rotating
forward
just
keep
that
top
hand
as
your
focal
point
one
more
time
forward
and
back
and
center
and
up
again
okay
so
um
this
next
part
if
you
are
comfortable
lying
down
on
your
back
i
would
recommend
doing
that
if
you
prefer
to
be
seated
you
can
definitely
do
this
seated
so
i
'm
going
to
take
it
down
onto
the
floor
and
once
you
lay
down
you
're
going
to
interlace
your
hands
and
place
your
hands
right
at
the
base
of
the
head
now
again
you
could
do
the
same
exact
thing
as
seated
if
you
prefer
now
if
you
have
any
shoulder
issues
uh
if
just
one
shoulder
is
not
comfortable
in
this
position
you
can
just
do
this
with
one
hand
or
if
neither
of
your
shoulders
are
comfortable
uh
overhead
you
can
use
a
pillow
under
your
head
is
fine
so
we
're
finding
this
sense
of
almost
traction
so
my
hands
are
at
the
base
of
the
skull
where
there
's
two
little
bony
points
and
i
'm
gently
lengthening
those
two
bony
points
away
from
my
shoulder
so
that
my
neck
is
nice
and
long
and
then
i
'll
relax
my
arms
by
my
side
so
my
head
's
heavy
neck
is
relaxed
and
then
i
'm
actually
gon
na
do
this
without
my
glasses
with
your
eyes
only
look
as
far
to
your
right
as
you
can
and
you
'll
just
allow
your
eyes
to
stay
in
that
position
so
eyes
are
looking
as
far
to
the
right
as
you
can
without
moving
your
head
and
then
come
back
to
your
breath
and
we
'll
stay
here
for
a
few
breaths
if
you
feel
a
sense
of
release
or
relaxation
response
like
a
sigh
or
a
yawn
you
can
bring
your
eyes
back
to
center
if
you
do
n't
quite
get
there
then
you
'll
just
stay
for
a
few
more
breaths
and
then
bring
your
eyes
back
to
center
if
they
're
not
already
and
just
blink
your
eyes
a
couple
times
you
may
have
to
repossession
reposition
your
head
and
neck
and
then
we
'll
do
the
same
thing
to
the
left
so
you
're
keeping
your
head
still
and
moving
only
your
eyes
looking
as
far
to
the
left
as
possible
and
then
once
you
do
that
you
'll
keep
your
eyes
left
back
to
your
breath
and
then
just
allow
your
body
to
relax
so
maybe
scanning
through
physical
sensations
of
your
body
to
see
if
there
's
anywhere
you
could
soften
you
know
i
tend
to
grip
through
my
hips
a
little
bit
so
it
's
helpful
to
relax
there
[
Music
]
or
maybe
you
could
find
a
little
more
ease
in
your
shoulders
take
one
more
breath
looking
left
come
back
to
center
again
blink
your
eyes
and
then
you
can
close
your
eyes
and
take
your
hands
out
from
behind
your
head
relax
them
by
your
sides
and
then
if
you
are
uh
laying
on
your
back
just
bring
your
knees
in
toward
your
chest
you
're
still
seated
you
might
fold
forward
over
your
legs
just
in
essence
giving
yourself
a
gentle
hug
and
take
a
few
breaths
there
checking
in
to
see
how
you
're
feeling
okay
and
then
releasing
your
feet
back
down
or
coming
back
to
seated
and
then
we're
going
to
move
on
to
laying
on
our
belly
so
you
'll
roll
over
if
you
're
on
the
floor
come
down
onto
the
floor
if
you
were
seated
and
then
you
're
going
to
be
propped
up
on
your
forearms
so
elbows
under
shoulders
if
you
can
if
this
feels
like
it
's
too
much
on
your
lower
back
then
you
can
take
your
elbows
wider
and
if
that
still
feels
like
too
much
you
might
go
still
a
little
wider
or
other
option
would
be
to
be
all
the
way
down
okay
so
we
do
want
to
be
working
to
open
the
chest
as
much
as
possible
so
again
you
can
take
nice
deep
breaths
okay
so
if
you
're
on
your
forearms
you
're
pressing
down
into
the
forearm
to
lift
the
crown
of
your
head
as
tall
towards
the
ceiling
as
you
can
and
then
you
might
allow
your
butt
muscles
and
your
legs
to
relax
and
then
start
to
breathe
into
your
belly
expanding
side
to
side
front
to
back
and
as
you
're
breathing
out
do
your
best
to
avoid
sinking
down
into
the
shoulders
okay
so
you
can
stay
here
or
we
're
going
to
add
a
side
bend
so
leading
with
your
eyes
look
left
side
bend
left
so
that
means
your
left
shoulder
will
go
towards
your
left
hip
and
you
're
looking
with
your
eyes
to
see
how
far
behind
you
can
see
maybe
you
could
see
one
foot
maybe
you
can
see
both
and
then
come
back
to
center
and
then
to
the
other
side
so
eyes
first
then
the
shoulders
and
then
the
waist
and
center
now
coordinating
that
with
your
breath
so
you
can
really
breathe
in
either
either
pattern
but
i
like
to
inhale
as
i
side
bend
and
exhale
back
to
center
keep
thinking
about
the
crown
of
the
head
lifting
away
from
the
floor
and
then
last
little
addition
here
if
you
're
comfortable
with
it
is
to
add
a
bend
of
the
opposite
knee
so
as
you
side
bend
the
left
you
're
bending
your
right
knee
and
center
and
as
you
side
bend
right
you
're
bending
your
left
knee
so
remember
eyes
are
leading
the
way
we
'll
do
one
more
in
each
direction
and
then
come
down
stack
one
hand
over
the
other
and
you
can
rest
either
your
cheek
or
your
forehead
on
your
hand
and
then
take
a
nice
deep
breath
into
your
belly
and
let
it
out
we
'll
do
one
more
belly
breath
here
i
like
to
do
the
belly
breath
on
the
floor
like
this
because
you
can
feel
your
belly
expand
against
the
floor
okay
and
if
you
're
comfortable
on
your
knees
in
a
child
's
pose
position
you
can
go
there
so
you
can
either
have
your
knees
apart
and
your
big
toes
together
with
your
knees
together
and
your
big
toes
together
hips
back
and
then
chest
comes
down
now
if
your
knees
and
or
hips
are
not
happy
here
just
roll
onto
your
back
and
hug
your
knees
into
your
chest
a
few
breaths
again
soften
and
relax
the
body
okay
and
then
we
're
going
to
add
a
side
bend
here
so
taking
your
hands
over
to
your
left
ribs
over
to
your
left
and
then
settling
into
that
child
's
pose
position
again
you
might
encourage
your
right
hip
to
draw
back
your
right
fingers
to
crawl
forward
and
then
now
as
you
breathe
send
your
breath
into
the
right
side
of
your
body
from
the
armpit
down
to
the
ribs
down
to
the
waist
and
then
take
your
time
coming
over
to
the
other
side
so
again
drawing
now
left
hip
back
left
fingers
forward
using
your
breath
into
the
left
side
of
your
body
to
create
expansion
to
increase
mobility
of
the
ribs
and
the
muscles
that
assist
in
breathing
and
then
come
back
to
center
and
back
up
again
okay
so
we
are
going
to
do
one
more
stretch
to
continue
to
open
up
the
rib
cage
area
again
the
muscles
in
between
the
ribs
help
to
breathe
or
allow
for
a
deeper
breath
so
you
come
on
to
your
side
with
your
knees
bent
so
they
're
going
to
line
up
with
your
hips
and
then
your
bottom
arm
can
go
out
in
front
and
if
your
neck
is
okay
with
it
your
head
can
come
down
if
you
feel
like
you
need
a
little
bit
of
a
support
just
grab
a
pillow
or
a
blanket
or
a
towel
and
roll
it
up
and
then
we
'll
start
to
lift
the
top
hand
towards
the
ceiling
so
right
up
over
your
shoulder
again
use
your
eyes
to
facilitate
this
so
you
're
looking
at
your
hand
just
above
your
shoulders
and
then
start
to
bring
your
top
shoulder
towards
the
floor
and
that
will
allow
your
arm
to
go
back
keep
following
your
hand
with
your
eyes
as
far
as
you
can
and
then
eventually
maybe
your
arm
reaches
the
ground
and
if
it
does
n't
that
's
okay
but
if
it
feels
like
it
's
strain
on
the
elbow
you
can
bend
your
elbow
and
just
rest
your
hand
on
your
shoulder
so
more
importantly
is
that
we
're
twisting
through
the
rib
cage
here
and
the
chest
stretch
is
sort
of
a
bonus
there
if
you
do
feel
comfortable
with
your
hand
on
the
floor
all
right
once
we
have
arrived
in
our
twist
you
're
welcome
to
close
your
eyes
and
begin
to
breathe
into
the
area
that
feels
like
it
's
stretching
the
most
for
you
so
perhaps
it
's
the
rib
cage
or
maybe
it
's
your
hip
or
your
inner
thighs
whatever
you
're
feeling
is
fine
just
send
your
breath
there
and
encourage
relaxation
to
come
to
you
and
then
take
your
time
as
you
start
to
unwind
yourself
back
and
then
we
are
going
to
turn
over
and
do
the
other
side
so
you
make
your
way
onto
your
second
side
again
knees
are
bent
out
in
line
with
your
hips
bottom
arm
out
in
front
head
comes
down
and
then
you
'll
lift
your
top
arm
up
towards
the
ceiling
find
the
hand
as
your
focal
point
and
then
your
shoulder
is
the
first
to
move
so
as
if
you
're
trying
to
get
that
top
shoulder
to
touch
the
floor
behind
you
which
first
folks
it
wo
n't
quite
get
there
and
that
's
okay
so
once
you
twist
as
far
as
you
can
you
can
always
bend
the
back
elbow
and
put
your
hand
on
your
chest
if
that
feels
more
supportive
or
you
can
let
your
hand
rest
on
the
floor
closing
your
eyes
if
you
wish
and
taking
a
few
deep
breaths
scanning
through
your
body
noticing
where
you
feel
any
restriction
or
gripping
and
sending
your
breath
there
okay
take
your
time
as
you
untwist
and
then
you
can
use
your
top
hand
to
press
you
up
to
seated
and
then
as
you
come
to
seed
it
again
let
's
uh
do
a
quick
check-in
so
you'll
close
your
eyes
let
your
arms
relax
by
your
sides
first
notice
your
natural
breath
after
spending
some
time
in
self-care
you
might
notice
your
emotional
state
after
this
short
practice
to
help
reset
your
nervous
system
and
decrease
stress
and
anxiety
you
might
check
in
with
your
physical
state
notice
the
muscles
around
your
eyes
your
jaw
your
neck
see
if
there
's
a
little
bit
more
softening
available
softening
the
outer
layer
connect
with
this
calm
peaceful
feeling
know
that
is
always
within
you
within
reach
when
you
're
ready
gently
blinking
your
eyes
open
so
any
of
that
can
be
separated
out
and
used
on
its
own
so

four
seven
eight
breath
pattern
the
self
massage
techniques
or

of

're
feeling

moments
of
stress
or
anxiety

up

to
this
practice
anytime
you
need
it
thanks
for
joining
metake
a
load
off
right
now
set
yourself
down
and
relax
as
best
you
can
in
this
moment
to
fully
appreciate
what
your
mind
is
capable
of
changing
[
Music
]
through
visualizing
the
sights
sounds
smells
and
feelings
described
you
can
alter
how
your
mind
perceives
any
anxious
thoughts
and
sensations
it
may
take
some
time
and
patience
to
see
results
but
with
perseverance
in
listening
to
this
soothing
meditation
track
on
a
regular
basis
your
subconscious
will
realize
that
those
situations
that
bring
high
energy
and
nervousness
can
be
alleviated
[
Music
]
please
make
this
time
for
yourself
by
setting
aside
an
area
where
you
can
fully
absorb
this
experience
safely
being
comfortable
and
reassured
that
only
good
things
will
come
take
a
moment
to
set
the
volume
of
this
audio
to
a
setting
where
you
wo
n't
have
to
move
and
is
not
too
loud
to
appreciate
any
lighting
the
need
adjusting
to
create
a
calmer
atmosphere
and
taking
care
of
any
otherwise
distracting
elements
can
be
done
there
[
Music
]
now
is
it
time
to
be
gentle
with
yourself
you
owe
it
to
yourself
your
mind
and
body
when
tension
builds
and
can
be
felt
it
can
cause
a
chain
reaction
a
snowball
effect
anxious
feelings
of
a
stirring
and
somersaulting
stomach
can
lead
to
tension
in
the
shoulders
and
other
areas
this
then
can
lead
to
negative
way
of
thinking
and
so
the
vicious
cycle
of
these
effects
continue
to
drown
out
any
positive
vibes
that
you
should
be
experiencing
over
time
the
confusion
of
what
causes
all
these
sensations
and
downward
where
your
thinking
gets
a
little
fuzzy
and
trying
to
understand
why
you
feel
the
way
you
do
becomes
lost
[
Music
]
as
this
meditation
continues
and
you
absorb
yourself
more
you
will
begin
to
open
up
seeing
understanding
and
realizing
that
perhaps
you
have
become
too
hard
on
yourself
[
Music
]
there
are
a
few
possibilities
of
my
anxiety
sneaks
up
when
you
least
expect
it
this
can
be
from
being
too
strong
for
too
long
guilt
from
the
past
or
simply
being
in
new
circumstances
there
are
many
many
more
these
are
just
examples
you
know
help
this
quiet
time
to
let
thoughts
feelings
and
sensations
be
shown
in
a
safe
and
calm
way
where
you
are
fully
in
control
in
a
moment
let
the
imaginative
side
of
your
mind
take
over
as
you
begin
to
relax
underneath
your
subconscious
will
be
making
notes
readjusting
things
and
compensating
you
with
a
more
positive
way
of
thinking
gifting
you
with
a
karma
mood
whilst
deeply
relaxing
your
body
[
Music

now
as
she
lays
still
and
relaxed
as
best
you
can
let
your
imagination
begin
to
take
over
see
in
front
of
you
a
corridor
and
at
the
end
of
just
a
few
steps
forward
is
light
take
a
break
from
your
mind
right
now
forwards
and
away
from
yourself
into
the
light
[
Music

the
dark
corridor
can
be
seen
as
the
confusion
that
surrounds
the
mystery
of
your
anxious
feelings
and
where
the
light
is
projected
from
will
perhaps
provide
you
with
answers
to
take
back
with
you
when
you
do
return
you
can
give
yourself
permission
to
bring
back
as
much
of
this
experience
as
you
wish
[

in
the
distance
you
see
blues
yellows
and
greens
mixed
in
with
a
subtle
warm
overturn
the
shapes
you
see
are
moving
slowly

very
easy
on
your
eyes
as
you
get
closer

becomes

now

at

the

comforting

the
sight
of
an
aqua
and

ocean
washes
the

white

as
they
spill
onto
the

walk
from

onto

your

soften

synchronizing
with
this
calm
atmosphere
feeling
the
soothing
effects
of

turn
and
close

just
dissolve

you
fully

atmosphere
of
bliss
nothing
matters

nobody
needs

around

misplaced
by
sleight

now
knowing
that
in

part

those
feelings
are

an
illusion
by
changing
your

focusing
on
more
positive
ideas

images
those

just
dispersed

very
much
like
doing
something
you
know
will
take
a

of
time
energy
and
hard
work
you
have
to
change
the
way
your

focuses
[

in

see
a
beautiful
scene
of
sand
sea
and
wolf
filling
your

with
such
an
image
as
a
positive
effect
which
transcends
to
your
body
in
relaxation
as
you
walk
closer
to
the
water

edge
you
feel
the
very
relaxing
fine
sand
under
and
around

drifts
off

pressed

calm

cycle
back

forth
the
warm
water
glides
over
your
ankles
instantly
taking
away
any
leftover
attention
in
all
areas
of
your
body
[

every
muscle
is
now
fully
relaxed
softer
and
resting
gently
as
you
are
hypnotically
massaged
by
every
soft
spill
of
warm
white
water
[

looking
outwards
you
notice
the
blue
ocean
glistening
as
a
million
ripples
shimmer
in
the
daytime
Sun
[
Music

on
the
sand
are
a
few
pebbles
within
reach
they
are
round
and
smooth
laying
under
the
water
you
pick
up
three
of
them
and
look
help
to
see
again
you
wonder
how
well
these
pebbles
were
skinned
on
the
calm
surface
of
the
warm
water
[
Music
]
as
you
slowly
pull
your
arm
back
with
the
first
pebble
you
place
a
thought
that
you
would
like
to
go
with
the
stone
[
Music

when
you
already
the
pebble
and
thought
go
as
one
across
the
air
[
Music

smoothly
skimming
the
top
of
the
water
eventually
making
a
satisfying
plunk
as
they
drift
to
the
ocean
floor
[
Music
]
as
the
pebble
and
food
disappear
from
sight
you
feel
slightly
more
clear-minded
relaxed
and
a
piece
[
Music
]
with
your
mind
now
being
more
serene
you
begin
to
notice
more
around
you
where
you
have
been
standing
soaking
up
the
gentle
white
water
wash
you
can
see
small
golden
fish
have
been
swimming
nearby
in
this
clear
blue
sea
crabs
tickling
the
water
with
their
pincers
and
a
reflection
of
the
water
when
your
legs
are
another
indication
of
how
relaxed
you
are
feeling
right
now
[
Music
]
when
you
think
more
clearly
and
more
positively
things
around
you
can
be
seen
more
obviously
it
only
takes
a
shift
in
focus
and
perception
to
realize
this
now
these
may
only
be
small
things
to
notice
but
they
help
to
create
a
fuller
picture
outside
in
life
this
can
also
be
practiced
where
there
may
be
stressful
or
anxious
situations
a
shift
in
focus
can
change
how
you
feel
and
more
importantly
help
you
follow
through
of
a
more
positive
outcome
the
more
this
is
practiced
consciously
the
easier
it
will
become
and
the
stronger
more
calm
you
will
be
in
these
situations

walking
along

shore
at

edge
brings
a
sense
of
freedom

look
around
at

beauty
that
surrounds
you
from
the
lull
of
each
wave

step
through

having
this
time
to

along

slides
along

is
a
reminder

begins
with
noticing
your

yourself
with

rest
your

descend

I
count
ten
you

melting
away

you
may
need
to
do

that
you
can
focus
on

to
completely
relax

allow
the

be
tuned
out

this
step
takes

even
deeper

you
are
committed
to
moving
your

to
the
next
level

as
you
descend
you
feel
the
familiar
state
of
freedom
in
your
body
and
clarity
in
your

it
comes
with
this
relaxation
for
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
comfort
as
you
relax
further
you
see
a
light
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs

almost
to
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
almost
to
the
light
shining
up
at
you
two
you
continue
deep
deep
into
relaxation
and
one
all
the
way
into
your
deepest

where
you
arrive
at

the

now
that
you
have
reached
the

beautiful
staircase
you
are
completely
relaxed
and
comfortable
take
a
moment
to
look
at
your
surroundings
in
this
dream
state
here
you
can
see
more
clearly
now
that
the
light
you
see
is
shining
out
from
behind
a
partially
closed
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
this
light
is
seeping
out
from
the
edges
of
the
door
expanding
its
light
outward
yet
being
partially
blocked
by
the
door
you
have
a
sense
that
behind
this
door
lies
all
that
you
are
capable
of
and
all
of
your
inner
potential
this
light
is
shining
out
only
a
little
bit
allowing
only
some
of
your
potential
to
be
seen
the
door
is
essentially
blocking
the
light
of
your
potential
to
be
fully
seen
you
know
that
before
this
door
can
be
opened
all
the
way
there
are
things
that
you
must
let
go
of
there
are
blocks
that
must
be
removed
recognizing
that
there
are

that
need

go
of

the
first
step
take
a
moment
and
first
let
go
of
any
negativity
you
may
be
holding
on
to
this
negativity
does
n't
have
to
be
named
specifically
just
let
it
go
let
the
energy
of
negativity
go
let
the
weight
of
limiting
beliefs
go
see
these
beliefs
floating
away
like
a
feather
being
blown
by
the
wind
only
to
be
replaced
with
new
positive
beliefs
these
limitations
we
put
on
ourselves
can
be
holding
us
back
from
moving
forwards
towards
our
ideal
life
and
towards
contentment
let
it
all
go
let
go
of
any
expectations
you
have
of

to

powerful
idea
that
you
are

All
people

I
used
to
feel

about
some
of
my
mistakes
because
I
am
a
good
person
and
want
to
do
the
best
that
I
can
,
and
now

I
have
learned
and
moved
on

errors

drift

busy
over
scheduled
world
where
we
often
think

need

do
it

be
at

of

can
cause
you

rest
heavy
on

follows
and
softens

and
allowing
your

to
return
to

that

can
begin
this
inquiry
process
by
checking
in
with
what
is
true
for
you
what
you
are
actually
feeling
without
judgment
and
without
trying
to
change
anything
[

make
space
for
the
truth
to
surface
and
whatever
form
it
comes
simply
allow
it
to
surface
[

consider
the
situation
or
feeling
that
has
you
overwhelmed

the

because
this
may
be
a

challenging
emotion
let
down
your
guard
and
your
armor
to
this
emotion
make
space
for
awareness
and
acceptance
without

we
often
have
the
unconscious
impulse
to
push
away
suppress

ignore
difficult
emotions

to
this
simple
meditation
to
relieve
stress
.
Get
into
a
nice
position
where
you
can
be
upright
,
elongating
the
spine
.
It
is
best
to
be
seated
in
the
traditional
meditation
position
with
legs
crossed
,
but
if
you
need
to
have
your
back
supported
,
you
may
sit
in
a
chair
.
Gaze
around
with
your
eyes
,
taking
note
of
your
surroundings
.
See
the
colors
clearly
.
Notice
things
that
are
completely
still
around
you
,
like
the
ground
,
furniture
,
and
structures
.
Can
you
become
aware
of
anything
around
you
that
has
movement
?
Look
around
without
putting
labels
on
the
things
you
see
,
just
observe
their
colors
,
textures
and
patterns
.
Notice
how
far
away
things
are
from
you
,
or
how
close
they
are
.
See
how
the
light
lays
upon
things
,
illuminating
them
.
Allow
your
mind
to
naturally
find
a
spot
in
front
of
you
to
fixate
on
.
Begin
to
slowly
blink
your
eyes
,
and
do
not
look
away
.
Feel
the
relaxation
within
the
darkness
each
time
you
blink
.
Repeat
think
until
your
eyes
want
to
naturally
close
.
When
you
close
your
eyes
,
notice
a
gentle
wave
of
relaxation
sweep
over
your
entire
body
.
Bring
your
awareness
to
your
breath
,
what
is
it
like
?
Did
you
take
a
nice
inhale
as
soon
as
you
focused
on
your
breathing
?
Pay
close
attention
to
how
your
lungs
expand
and
contract
with
your
breath
.
It
is
a
very
natural
and
gentle
sensation
.
Noticing
how
your
belly
also
expands
and
contracts
easily
as
you
breathe
.
Allow
the
breath
to
relax
you
.
In
and
out…
..
Expand
and
contract…
.
Refresh
and
relax…
..
Inhale
and
exhale…

one

anxiety
and
stress

often
scheduled
to
the
max
and
we
become
physically
and
emotionally
stressed
out
we
often
find
our
mind
cluttered
and
overthinking
we
worry
about

thought
leaders

the
way
we
do
anything
is
the
way
we
do
everything

if
we

to
declutter
our
mind
we
must
also
declutter
our
physical
world

first
help
yourself
and
love
yourself
before

can
help
or
love
anyone
else
and
when
you
are
ready
close
your
eyes
and
bring
your
full
awareness
to
your
breath
begin
to
count
your
breath
in
then
as
you
breathe
out
encourage
the
exhale
to
be
one
count
longer
than
the
inhale
allow
each
exhale
to
carry
away
with
it
any
physical
and
emotional
stress
and
tension

exhaling
longer
than
you
inhale

breath
will
naturally
slow
and
your

will
calm
down

this
for
a
few
breaths
cycles
then
allow
the
breath
to
return
to
its
natural
rhythm
know
that
your
breath
is
an
anchor
to
the
present
moment
you
know
that
you
can
not
get
back
a
breath
from
your
past
nor
can
you
make
a
future
breath
come
any
sooner
than
the
present
moment
so
you
know
you
are
always
in
the
present
moment
when
you
are
attentive
to
your
breath
as
you
may
still
have
thoughts
going
through
your
mind
notice
them
from
afar
as
if
you
are
an
observer
notice
your
thoughts
and
acknowledge
them
by
saying
in
your
mind
thinking
then
come
back
to
the
breath
and
use
this
breath
as
an
anchor
to
keep
coming
back
to
whenever
your
mind
wanders
this
breath
anchor
is
a
grounding
and
stress
relieving
practice
to
continue
outside
of
the
session
whenever
you
may
experience
a
stressful
situation
at
any
point
in
life
you
can
always
just
come
back
to
your
breath
as
if
you
are
starting
over
this
anchor
will
allow
you
to
relax
and
times
of
stress
as
you
focus
your
attention
on
your
breath
approach
this
meditation
with
the
intention
to
simplify
and
to
slow
down
allow
your
body
to
soften
and
your
breath
to
be
gone
know
that
your
body
responds
to
your
thoughts
so
think
about
relaxing
and
ask
your
body
for
a
release
of
tension
your
mind
is
so
powerful
in
creating
change
in
all
aspects
of
your
life
and
now
as
you
breathe
in
imagine
that
your
breath
has
a
bright
white
color
to
it
and
it
is
filling
you
up
as
you
breathe
out
that
white
light
is
taking
with
it
any
physical
tension
or
feelings
of
anxiety
take
a
long
slow
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
and
now
move
the
breath
all
the
way
down
into
your
abdomen
filling
you
up
with
light
and
making
space
then
allow
your
body
to
just
surrender
as
you
exhale
breathing
out
anything
that
no
longer
serves
you
each
full
breath
clears
out
the
clutter
and
relaxes
your
body
and
mind
even
more
deeply
and
now
invite
your
body
to
relax
each
muscle
completely
begin
with
the
muscles
around
the
eyes
and
the
jaw
by
relaxing
these
muscles
specifically
the
rest
of
the
body
knows
exactly
what
to
do
and
will
relax
in
response
continue
to
unclench
the
jaw
completely
and
soften
the
muscles
around
the
eyes
to
begin
to
feel
that
familiar
heaviness
throughout
the
entire
body
all
you
have
to
do
is
think
about
relaxing
and
releasing
the
tension
in
your
body
and
your
body
will
respond
because
it
listens
to
what
your
mind
tells
it

feel
the
entire
body

go

that
the
tension
in
your
body
has
begun
to
loosen
and
subside

with
your
breath

you
find
your
mind
wandering

with
the
physical
sensations
of
your
body
so
that
your
mind
can
continue
to
clear
the
clutter
of
the
overthinking
tendency
know
that
your
subconscious
mind
will
be
aware
of
anything
that
is
important
to
you
you
are
in
complete
control
but
for
now
your
mind
and
body
know
it
is
time
to
relax
and
let
go
time
to
slow
down
right
now
all
sounds
around
you
are
unimportant
and
they
just
add
to
your
relaxation
all
responsibilities
and
items
on
your
to-do
list
are
unimportant

you
walk
out
into
the
basement
of
your
subconscious
mind
you
take
a
look
around
and
see
that
you
have
stepped
out
into
what
looks
like
a
library
that
stores
all
of
your
memories

well
as
the
possibilities
for
your
future
there
are
rows

of
the
books
are
disorganized
and
there
are
areas
of
clutter
around
the
floor

in

step
into

have
a
strong
sense
that

I

a
wonderful
dayyou
gon
na
sit
with
me
girl
am
i
live
all
right
welcome
welcome
everyone
thanks
for
joining
me
uh
if
you
're
new
here
i
'm
sarah
raymond
with
the
mindful
movement
i'm
really
honored
to
have
you
here
and
if
you
are
joining
me
again
welcome
back
uh
if
you
if
you
have
been
here
you
might
notice
that
this
is
not
my
typical
space
i
am
outside
it
is
cold
in
maryland
so
i
have
my
my
lovely
scarf
that
my
daughter
knitted
for
me
sorry
crocheted
excuse
me
she
will
get
mad
that
i
said
that
and
uh
we
got
a
fire
and
here
i
am
i
'm
glad
to
be
here
and
i
just
want
to
take
a
minute
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
control
so
we
do
n't
really
have
control
right
like
i
do
n't
have
control
over
the
wind
tonight
i
do
n't
have
control
over
the
smoke
that
might
blow
into
my
face
or
the
dog
's
making
noise
or
all
of
the
things
so
we
do
have
choice
so
i
decided
i
wanted
to
go
live
tonight
i
made
the
choice
that
i
was
okay
with
not
having
control
over
the
lighting
and
the
space
and
the
temperature
and
all
the
things
and
i
made
the
choice
to
respond
in
a
way
that
i
could
still
feel
safe
and
i
could
be
okay
with
my
choice
and
that
's
the
lesson
or
the
the
teaching
i
'd
love
to
embody
or
impart
in
today
's
practice
so
if
you
do
hear
the
wind
blowing
then
i
invite
you
to
sit
with
it
recognize
how
your
body
instinctively
responds
you
might
even
acknowledge
that
response
and
see
if
you
can
still
work
to
calm
your
body
calm
your
responses
as
we
go
through
the
practice
so
that
's
my
my
intention
my
invitation
for
you
and
if
you
have
any
other
intention
for
today
's
practice
then
please
honor
that
and
that
being
said
today
's
practice
will
be
very
gentle
not
a
lot
of
movement
per
se
but
self
massage
and
various
exercises
to
help
you
regulate
your
nervous
system
or
calm
the
nervous
system
and
we
're
not
going
to
get
into
a
lot
of
the
science
or
the
what
's
happening
just
to
feel
into
the
experience
but
i
did
leave
a
link
in
the
description
box
below
the
video
to
two
different
books
that
are
great
resources
so
if
you
do
want
to
learn
a
little
bit
more
check
those
out
all
right
so
let
's
jump
right
in
so
make
yourself
comfortable
i
'm
sitting
down
obviously
you
're
welcome
to
sit
in
a
chair
if
that
's
more
comfortable
for
you
i
would
suggest
being
upright
for
at
least
the
first
portion
of
it
as
we
get
into
the
meditation
then
you
can
lie
down
and
i
should
mention
that
les
is
here
with
us
behind
the
camera
and
he
will
be
in
the
chat
so
if
you
have
any
questions
comments
please
feel
free
to
leave
them
i
'm
just
getting
uh
getting
a
signal
we
all
good
less
we
're
all
good
someone
's
saying
please
rotate
if
possible
rotate
and
here
is
the
we
do
n't
have
control
over
everything
i
think
we
just
have
to
go
with
it
and
we
're
going
to
do
the
best
we
can
tonight
am
i
vertical
i
think

from
their
device

ta
go
with
the
flow

can
rotate
it
from
their
device

is
saying
you
can
rotate
from
your
device
i
hope
that
helps
rotate
on
your
device
okay
thank
you
uh
we
're
gon
na
we
're
gon
na
go
with
the
flow
tonight
and
i
apologize
if
there
's
any
glitches
or
tech
technical
issues
but
i
hope
that
you
enjoy
the
practice
okay
so
let
's
start
with
a
belly
breath
as
a
way
to
just
check
in
so
i
like
to
have
hands
on
my
belly
so
i
can
get
a
feel
for
the
movement
there
nothing
forced
nothing
too
strenuous
just
checking
in
so
if
you
feel
like
you
want
to
close
your
eyes
you
are
welcome
to
do
so
and
then
begin
to
breathe
in
through
your
nose
sending
your
breath
down
into
your
belly
and
as
you
breathe
out
you
might
like
to
breathe
out
through
your
mouth
like
a
sigh
so
you
're
making
a
sound
if
that
does
n't
feel
comfortable
any
other
breath
pattern
is
fine
so
taking
a
moment
to
check
in
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
notice
the
state
of
your
body
the
state
of
your
mind
and
you
might
even
notice
the
state
of
your
nervous
system
no
judgment
no
need
to
change
at
this
point
just
noticing
you
might
think
of
taking
like
a
snapshot
in
your
memory
of
how
you're
feeling
in
this
moment
and
then
once
you
have
that
baseline
let
's
blink
our
eyes
open
again
if
they
were
closed
and
then
we
're
going
to
go
into
a
little
bit
of
self
massage
and
everything
that
i
offer
is
just
that
it
's
an
offering
take
it
if
you
like
it
but
listen
to
your
body
and
if
it's
saying
no
this
is
n't
so
so
right
for
me
right
now
just
explore
see
what
your
body
needs
today
all
right
so
we
're
going
to
start
with
a
a
jaw
massage
so
you
can
find
the
indentation
at
the
jaw
so
it
's
about
in
line
with
the
earlobe
and
pardon
my
dogs
you
're
gon
na
press
your
fingers
into
your
jaw
fairly
firmly
going
inward
listen
to
your
body
and
you
decide
how
much
pressure
is
right
for
you
and
then
you
can
explore
maybe
circles
feel
great
maybe
just
holding
the
pressure
feels
good
perhaps
you
want
to
go
up
and
down
side
to
side
you
can
open
and
close
your
jaw
you
might
take
a
nice
deep
breath
in
and
let
it
out
like
a
sigh
relaxing
the
lower
portion
of
your
jaw
all
right
so
if
that
feels
great
and
you
want
to
keep
going
keep
going
otherwise
i
'll
move
on
to
just
um
to
the
side
of
your
nose
so
you
think
of
the
the
lines
that
are
the
crease
of
our
between
our
nose
and
our
mouth
you're
gon
na
go
about
the
top
of
that
crease
and
you
'll
press
in
towards
your
nose
a
bit
and
then
once
you
have
that
pressure
gently
pull
out
so
it
's
almost
like
you
're
opening
your
sinuses
and
then
just
like
we
did
with
the
jaw
maybe
circles
feel
great
or
maybe
up
and
down
i
know
it
looks
a
little
silly
but
we
can
all
be
silly
together
or
maybe
just
hold
the
pressure
and
here
's
a
nice
place
to
gently
pull
out
on
the
skin
out
on
the
muscles
and
take
a
deep
breath
in
you
might
even
feel
you
get
more
air
in
and
let
it
go
again
stay
there
a
little
longer
if
you
'd
like
otherwise
we
're
going
to
go
to
the
corner
inside
corner
of
your
eyebrows
so
press
pressing
in
gently
you
might
just
let
your
head
rest
in
your
hands
and
then
same
options
go
here
you
can
move
around
in
a
circle
it
'll
be
a
pretty
small
circle
or
just
up
and
down
and
side
to
side
and
then
again
feel
free
to
stay
a
little
longer
and
then
lastly
we
're
going
to
go
to
the
ears
so
i
'll
give
you
lots
of
options
and
you
can
choose
what
feels
really
good
leave
what
doesn't
and
we
'll
start
inside
of
the
ear
so
not
in
the
hole
of
your
ear
but
in
the
on
the
cartilage
and
you
're
just
going
to
kind
of
follow
the
line
follow
the
different
parts
of
your
ears
around
kind
of
like
what
you
might
use
a
q-tip
for
although
you
're
not
going
to
go
inside
the
ear
canal
and
then
i
do
n't
know
if
you
can
see
this
but
you
're
going
to
grab
the
earlobes
and
just
gently
you
can
pull
out
you
can
pull
forward
and
then
work
your
way
up
the
side
of
the
ear
and
this
area
for
me
always
feels
really
nourishing
really
relaxing
my
dogs
are
going
a
little
crazy
running
around
okay
and
then
just
relax
your
arms
by
your
sides
if
you
want
to
close
your
eyes
again
you
can
and
let
's
take
one
more
check
in
so
all
we
've
really
done
is
a
little
bit
of
self-massage
so
just
notice
how
that
is
serving
you
and
just
keep
in
mind
everyone
's
different
your
body
is
different
your
nervous
system
is
different
your
personal
history
is
different
from
mine
and
anyone
else
that
's
watching
so
your
experience
in
this
practice
will
also
be
different
so
just
take
what
you
like
and
leave
the
rest
okay
so
a
little
bit
more
nervous
system
resetting
and
then
we'll
move
into
our
meditation
so
you
'll
keep
your
your
eye
gaze
looking
forward
and
then
i
'll
mirror
you
you
can
tip
your
left
shoulder
excuse
me
left
ear
towards
your
left
shoulder
without
lifting
your
your
shoulder
to
meet
your
ear
so
keep
drawing
the
shoulder
down
there
we
go
and
then
with
your
head
still
take
your
eyes
as
far
to
your
right
as
you
can
so
it
's
almost
like
you
're
trying
to
see
your
right
ear
with
your
head
tipped
to
your
left
keep
your
eyes
fixed
right
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
let
it
out
with
a
sigh
again
feel
free
to
come
out
of
this
sooner
if
you
feel
any
need
to
do
so
one
more
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
out
like
a
thigh
take
your
time
bring
your
head
back
to
center
eyes
back
to
looking
straight
ahead
blink
a
couple
times
and
then
we
'll
repeat
in
the
other
direction
so
your
right
ear
towards
your
right
shoulder
and
then
eyes
looking
as
far
to
your
left
as
you
can
breathing
in
and
out
three
breaths
if
you
can
come
out
of
it
sooner
if
you
need
to
ah
and
then
the
head
comes
back
up
eyes
look
forward
blink
a
few
times
and
then
we'll
do
a
variation
of
that
with
a
side
bend
so
i
'm
going
to
offer
the
side
bend
if
it
's
too
much
do
n't
worry
about
adding
it
so
we
'll
go
back
to
left
ear
towards
the
left
shoulder
and
then
you
might
allow
for
a
little
bit
more
of
a
side
bend
so
meaning
you're
you
're
taking
your
spine
over
to
your
left
and
if
you
still
want
a
little
bit
more
your
left
hand
can
gently
uh
gently
gently
tug
on
your
head
and
then
we
'll
take
eyes
now
to
the
left
ear
so
you
're
looking
towards
the
arm
that
's
up
my
glasses
always
seem
to
be
in
the
way
for
this
one
all
right
so
about
three
breaths
there
and
as
you
breathe
out
through
your
mouth
think
of
relaxing
your
jaw
may
even
wiggle
it
side
to
side
and
then
take
your
time
coming
back
through
center
and
then
other
side
so
we
go
right
here
towards
the
right
shoulder
feel
free
to
add
a
little
side
bend
to
your
right
and
then
option
to
take
your
right
hand
gently
very
very
gently
we
're
not
tugging
too
hard
here
and
then
eyes
are
going
to
your
towards
your
right
ear
so
it
's
kind
of
on
a
downward
diagonal
about
three
breaths
uh
and
then
bring
your
head
and
eyes
back
to
center
okay
so
i
feel
a
lot
more
calm
than
i
did
when
we
started
so
i
hope
that
you
do
as
well
although
it
's
not
a
requirement
obviously
if
that
's
not
how
you
feel
that
's
your
experience
but
i
would
love
to
guide
you
now
into
a
meditation
so
if
you
prefer
to
lie
down
you
are
welcome
to
do
so
make
yourself
comfortable
and
if
you
prefer
to
sit
up
that
's
fine
too
so
i
like
to
think
of
posture
as
something
that
we
do
n't
have
to
really
think
about
so
get
yourself
into
a
position
that
does
n't
take
a
lot
of
effort
but
allows
you
to
be
in
a
a
straight
spine
position
and
then
if
you
'd
like
you
are
welcome
to
close
your
eyes
you
do
n't
have
to
we
want
you
to
feel
safe
so
if
you
choose
not
to
close
your
eyes
maybe
just
soften
your
gaze
downward
and
then
just
as
we
started
take
a
moment
to
simply
notice
without
judgment
without
the
need
to
change
you
might
notice
the
state
of
your
physical
body
state
of
your
your
mind
your
thoughts
you
might
become
aware
of
sounds
in
your
environment
sounds
coming
through
the
video
from
my
environment
and
the
practice
that
we
just
finished
we
just
went
through
is
about
inner
resourcing
about
using
your
own
ability
to
come
into
a
calm
state
and
so
when
there
is
a
noise
when
there
is
a
distraction
because
there
will
always
be
distractions
the
practice
is
about
coming
back
to
yourself
coming
home
to
yourself
so
with
that
in
mind
let's
begin
to
move
into
a
box
breathing
pattern
so
we
are
taking
a
little
intention
into
our
breath
so
we
're
breathing
in
for
a
count
holding
for
the
same
count
breathing
out
for
the
same
count
and
holding
once
more
so
you
might
choose
to
start
with
a
count
of
three
or
four
and
just
see
how
that
feels
in
your
body
so
in
your
own
time
breathing
in
holding
breathing
out
holding
continue
on
your
own
for
a
few
breaths
if
you
want
to
increase
the
length
the
count
of
your
breath
that
's
fine
if
you
find
you
get
distracted
or
lose
your
count
simply
start
over
finish
the
breath
cycle
that
you
are
on
and
just
allow
your
breath
to
be
natural
and
see
what
you
notice
are
there
sensations
showing
up
in
your
body
you
might
even
ask
yourself
is
there
a
message
here
as
you
notice
my
dog
's
barking
notice
your
response
can
you
lovingly
start
over
can
you
lovingly
bring
yourself
home
to
your
experience
so
in
this
hopefully
calm
and
reflective
state
you
can
ask
yourself
what
is
it
that
i
need
and
just
listen
no
thinking
no
trying
just
allow
the
answer
to
surface
what
is
it
that
i
need
you
might
notice
how
your
body
your
mind
your
nervous
system
are
all
responding
to
this
question
when
was
the
last
time
someone
asked
you
that
and
how
does
it
feel
to
be
able
to
ask
yourself
to
connect
with
your
inner
resources
so
take
another
moment
to
just
notice
what
's
there
for
you
and
very
gradually
begin
to
let
your
awareness
brought
in
you
might
start
by
noticing
the
support
beneath
you
noticing
the
air
touching
any
exposed
skin
[
Music
]
or
perhaps
you
are
able
to
sense
the
energy
around
you
and
before
you
open
your
eyes
if
they
're
still
closed
see
if
you
can
sense
both
your
inner
experience
and
your
outer
environment
the
same
time
and
as
best
you
can

You
do
n't
even
have
to
listen
or
pay
attention

you
can
simply
relax
while
I
talk

Just
let

drift

and
reflect
upon
these
affirmations
for
self-esteem
in

back

mind

with
your
subconscious

You

take
in
the
affirmations
for
self-esteem

choose
to
and

I
'll
count
back
from

choose
to

drift
off

to
focus
especially
on
any
of
them
.
You
are
a

You

capable
of
achieving
many
things

You

the
problems
that
come
your
way

understanding
that
no

needs
to
be
strong
all
the
time

You
are
an
okay
person

Your
worth
is
not
measured
by
achievements

appearance
,
or

things

You
are

one

to
the
max
and
we
become
physically

the
way

do
anything
is

a
breath
from
your
past
nor
can
you
make
a
future

any
sooner
than
the
present
moment
so
you
know
you
are
always
in
the
present
moment

are
attentive
to
your
breath

may
still
have
thoughts
going

you
are
an
observer
notice
your
thoughts

wanders

breath
anchor
is

times
of
stress

is
so
powerful
in
creating

relaxation

observer
see
yourself
smiling
with
a
positive
calm

competent
mind
feeling
proud

grateful
when
you
awake

will
still
feel
all
of
the
positive
feelings
you
experienced
in
this
meditation
and
you
have
patience
and
persistence
for
the
practice
of
simplifying
and
decluttering
your
mind
and
physical
world
in
just
a
moment
I
will
count
as
the
elevator
slowly
brings
you
back
up

day
This
practice
provides
a
different
lens
through
which
you
can
examine
the
body
.
Give
yourself
space
to
drop
in
and
deeply
investigate
these
elements
in
your
body
.
Try
to
bring
an
open
mind
,
and
see
what
you
can
learn
about
yourself
.
Remember
that
mindfulness
is
about
seeing
clearly
,
and
looking
at
things
from
a
new
perspective
can
often
bring
that
clarity
.
Settle
into
a
relaxed
position
.
Close
the
eyes
,
and
bring
your
awareness
to
the
places
in
the
body
where
you
experience
contact
,
such
as
the
feet
on
the
floor
,
the
hands
in
the
lap
,
or
the
body
sitting
in
the
chair
.
Begin
with
the
element
of
earth
or
solid
form
.
Without
thinking
too
hard
about
what
this
means
,
openly
examine
where
and
how
you
can
feel
solidity
.
This
might
be
the
structure
of
your
skeleton
,
the
chair
you
’
re
sitting
on
,
any
places
of
tension
in
the
body
,
or
the
weight
of
your
muscles
as
they
relax
.
Don
’
t
rush
through
these
sensations
or
try
to
force
them
.
When
you
feel
the
earth
element
in
the
body
,
stay
with
it
for
a
few
deep
breaths
.
Continue
this
seeking
,
recognizing
,
and
feeling
for
a
few
breaths
.
After
five
minutes
,
switch
to
the
element
of
air
or
wind
.
An
obvious
place
to
start
is
in
the
form
of
the
body
breathing
.
Where
can
you
feel
the
air
of
the
breath
?
You
may
also
look
for
places
in
the
body
where
you
can
feel
empty
space—
the
nostrils
,
the
mouth
,
and
the
ears
can
offer
insight
into
the
air
element.Begin
by
getting
comfortable
.
You
may
want
to
sit
or
lie
down
.
Close
your
eyes
,
or
focus
your
gaze
on
one
spot
in
the
room
.
Start
to
relax
your
body
,
beginning
with
your
feet
.
Allow
a
feeling
of
relaxation
to
fill
your
feet
...
feeling
heavy
,
loose
,
and
relaxed
.
Relax
your
ankles
...
lower
legs
...
and
knees
.
Allow
the
relaxation
to
continue
,
relaxing
your
upper
legs
.
Let
the
muscles
of
your
legs
completely
let
go
...
feeling
very
heavy
and
relaxed
.
Relax
your
hips
and
pelvis
,
and
all
the
surrounding
muscles
.
Feel
your
stomach
and
lower
back
relaxing
...
the
muscles
giving
up
their
hold
.
Feel
the
relaxation
in
your
chest
,
back
,
and
sides
...
feeling
very
relaxed
...
very
heavy
.
Let
your
hands
relax
,
all
the
way
from
your
fingertips
to
your
wrists
.
Feel
your
lower
arms
relaxing
...
letting
go
.
Relax
your
elbows
and
upper
arms
...
loose
and
heavy
.
Relax
your
shoulders
,
feeling
them
lowering
slightly
...
finding
a
comfortable
,
relaxed
position
...
free
from
tension
...
Allow
the
muscles
of
your
neck
to
relax
...
letting
go
...
and
relax
your
face
and
head
.
Feel
your
entire
body
relaxing
even
more
deeply
...
becoming
completely
relaxed
...
limp
...
heavy
...
comfortable
.
Now
turn
your
attention
inward
...
even
more
deeply
inside
...
to
find
your
authentic
self
.
Begin
by
reflecting
upon
your
values
.
What
is
the
most
important
to
you
in
life
?
What
do
you
value
?
Where
does
your
sense
of
right
and
wrong
come
from
?
Spend
the
next
few
moments
thinking
about
your
values
.
(
Pause
)
The
values
you
have
been
thinking
of
make
up
part
of
the
core
of
who
you
are
.
If
you
are
being
true
to
your
values
,
these
core
beliefs
will
drive
your
behavior
.
It
feels
good
to
behave
in
ways
that
are
consistent
with
your
values
.
For
example
,
if
honesty
is
something
you
value
,
this
could
be
reflected
in
your
life
by
being
truthful
.
If
you
value
your
family
,
perhaps
your
life
reflects
this
in
the
time
you
spend
with
family
members
.
Think
about
how
your
values
can
be
a
part
of
your
day-to-day
life
.
(
Pause
)
Now
consider
what
else
makes
you
who
you
are
.
Finding
your
authentic
self
involves
learning
who
you
truly
are
.
Your
authentic
self
is
the
real
you
,
the
person
you
are
truly
meant
to
be
.
Your
authentic
self
is
the
person
you
are
the
core
,
the
person
you
can
be
if
nothing
holds
you
back
.
Imagine
the
person
you
believe
yourself
to
be
right
now
.
It
's
okay
if
you
are
n't
quite
sure
who
you
are
...
just
picture
yourself
going
about
the
things
you
usually
do
in
a
typical
day
.
Imagine
that
you
are
watching
yourself
...
observing
yourself
going
about
your
usual
activities
.
See
yourself
getting
up
in
the
morning
...
going
about
your
day
...
imagine
the
things
that
you
do
in
a
typical
day
.
See
yourself
doing
these
activities
.
Picture
this
person
...
you
...
standing
in
an
empty
room
.
Imagine
watching
this
person
...
observe
...
now
imagine
you
could
strip
away
all
the
things
that
hold
you
back
from
your
full
potential
.
Imagine
self-doubt
dissolving
...
being
replaced
with
confidence
and
self-assurance
.
Picture
this
person
before
you
,
and
imagine
all
the
things
that
get
in
the
way
of
success
...
such
as
circumstances
,
lack
of
resources
,
lack
of
forgiveness
,
illness
,
baggage
from
the
past
...
anything
that
is
holding
this
person
back
in
any
way
at
all
...
See
these
problems
dissolving
...
disappearing
...
going
away
...
Now
imagine
this
person
,
standing
in
the
empty
room
.
What
is
left
?
Who
is
this
person
when
all
those
barriers
are
stripped
away
?
This
person
is
you
.
Imagine
who
you
are
at
the
core
...
the
pure
character
that
is
left
when
there
is
nothing
to
get
in
the
way
of
complete
self-expression
.
You
may
only
have
a
vague
picture
in
your
mind
right
now
...
let
's
allow
that
picture
to
come
into
focus
...
becoming
more
clear
...
Think
of
your
motivations
...
what
motivates
you
?
What
drives
your
behavior
?
What
catches
your
interest
...
or
has
caught
your
interest
in
the
past
?
What
propels
you
to
action
?
Think
about
your
personality
and
character
traits
...
the
characteristics
that
are
left
when
all
barriers
are
removed
and
all
fears
have
gone
away
.
At
your
fullest
potential
,
your
simplest
form
...
with
no
fears
...
what
traits
do
you
have
?
Think
about
your
energy
...
are
you
laid
back
and
calm
,
or
are
you
energetic
?
Think
about
your
other
characteristics
...
Are
you
introverted
or
extroverted
?
Quiet
or
talkative
?
Are
you
creative
?
Are
you
practical
?
What
sorts
of
things
do
you
appreciate
?
What
do
you
admire
?
What
do
you
like
?
Imagine
something
that
makes
you
feel
happy
...
what
is
it
?
Think
of
some
things
you
enjoy
...
things
that
you
like
to
do
...
Think
about
all
the
characteristics
of
the
person
who
is
left
when
all
barriers
and
fears
are
removed
.
(
Pause
)
Now
let
's
create
a
different
picture
.
Imagine
yourself
as
a
young
child
,
in
a
happy
moment
.
See
the
potential
in
this
child
.
Who
is
this
young
person
?
What
makes
this
child
who
he
or
she
is
?
(
Pause
)
Think
about
the
characteristics
that
you
share
with
this
child
.
In
what
ways
are
you
similar
?
In
what
ways
does
the
current
you
differ
from
this
child
?
Think
about
how
you
have
learned
and
grown
since
the
time
you
were
a
small
child
.
(
Pause
)
Now
picture
yourself
as
the
child
...
see
the
world
through
your
younger
self
's
eyes
.
What
did
you
want
to
be
when
you
grew
up
?
What
hopes
did
you
have
for
your
future
self
?
What
dreams
did
you
have
as
a
child
?
The
hopes
and
dreams
you
had
as
a
child
were
probably
related
in
some
way
to
your
authentic
self
.
Something
about
your
dreams
was
connected
to
a
part
of
your
true
self
.
What
do
these
aspirations
say
about
who
you
are
?
What
personal
characteristics
of
yours
are
related
to
your
childhood
dreams
?
For
example
,
if
as
a
child
you
dreamed
about
becoming
an
astronaut
,
you
probably
have
some
personality
traits
that
relate
to
this
dream
...
such
as
being
adventurous
,
curious
,
analytical
...
Think
about
your
own
childhood
dreams
,
and
see
what
these
dreams
say
about
who
you
are
.
(
Pause
)
Now
create
one
final
picture
in
your
mind
.
Imagine
,
in
as
much
detail
as
you
can
,
the
person
you
want
to
be
.
Imagine
your
ideal
self
...
How
would
this
person
behave
?
What
does
this
person
,
your
authentic
self
,
value
?
What
motivates
this
ideal
self
?
What
personal
characteristics
are
present
in
this
ideal
version
of
you
?
Imagine
all
the
details
of
the
person
you
most
want
to
be
.
(
Pause
)
The
image
in
your
mind
right
now
,
of
this
ideal
person
,
is
you
.
This
is
your
authentic
self
.
This
is
who
you
are
.
At
the
core
,
beneath
all
of
life
's
getting
in
the
way
...
this
is
you
.
Spend
a
few
moments
with
this
image
of
your
authentic
self
.
Now
allow
yourself
to
step
inside
this
image
,
and
fully
become
this
person
.
Become
who
you
are
.
For
this
moment
,
just
be
...
simply
be
your
authentic
self
.
Feel
a
sense
of
calm
and
serenity
...
secure
in
who
you
are
...
knowing
who
you
are
.
This
is
you
.
Your
authentic
self
.
You
can
take
this
authentic
self
with
you
...
allowing
this
true
essence
of
you
to
shine
through
in
everyday
life
.
Allow
your
values
,
personality
,
and
motivations
to
shine
though
...
to
guide
your
behavior
...
to
make
up
who
you
are
.
You
have
always
been
this
person
...
you
always
will
be
your
authentic
self
...
a
positive
,
confident
person
.
A
person
you
like
and
appreciate
.
Underneath
the
challenges
,
the
baggage
,
the
demands
of
living
life
...
this
is
the
real
you
that
will
always
be
with
you
.
(
Pause
)
It
's
time
to
reawaken
now
...
to
conclude
this
relaxation
exercise
...
Keep
the
image
of
your
authentic
self
with
you
as
you
go
about
the
rest
of
your
day
.
Express
this
true
self
...
and
allow
you
to
simply
be
you
.
Wiggle
your
fingers
,
waking
up
your
hands
and
arms
...
Move
your
toes
,
allowing
your
feet
and
legs
to
wake
up
...
Feel
your
muscles
reawakening
...
and
your
whole
body
filling
with
energy
.
Open
your
eyes
and
sit
quietly
for
a
moment
while
you
reorient
to
your
surroundings
...
When
you
are
completely
awake
and
alert
,
you
can
return
to
your
usual
activities
,
feeling
confident
and
calm
,
in
touch
with
your
authentic
self.when
you
can
route
yourself
in
the
present
moment
it
allows
you
to
let
go
of
the
worry
of
what
's
to
come
in
the
future
and
possible
regrets
about
what
has
happened
in
the
past
create
a
safe
and
tranquil
environment
for
yourself
to
experience
the
stress
relief
of
being
present
this
practice
will
not
only
relieve
the
stress
you
may
be
experiencing
now
but
also
releases
stress
you
may
be
carrying
from
the
past

[

make
any
adjustments
to
your

or
your

so
that
you
can
come
into
a
place
of
effortless
ease
perhaps
close
your
eyes
or
soften
your
gaze
take
in
a
deep
breath
through
your
nose
and
sigh
it
out
through
your
mouth
take
two
more
breaths
just
like
this
to
begin
to
calm
your
body
and
mind
and
now
enjoy
the
easy
flow
of
your
natural
breath
today
we
will
use
our
senses
to
observe
the
present
moment
mindfulness
is
in
essence
the
practice
of
bringing
your
awareness
into
the
present
moment
begin
now
to
use
your
sense
of
hearing
to
broaden
your
field
of
awareness
listen
to
the
sounds
in
your
immediate
surroundings
what
noises
can
you
hear
that
are
close
to
you
are
there
sounds
of
the
heater
or
air-conditioning
running
is
there
a
clock
ticking
do
you
hear
birds
or
animals
are
there
cars
or
other
vehicles
bringing
noise
to
your
awareness
listen
to
the
sound
of
my
voice
to
be
in
a
relaxed
state
in
this
present
moment
what
is
the
subtlest
sound
that
you
can
detect
when
you
listen
even
if
you
have
headphones
on
maybe
you
can
detect
a
quiet
buzz
on
the
recording
or
some
other
sound
in
the
background
what
would
it
be
like
to
let
the
sounds
around
you
come
to
you
rather
than
working
to
search
them
out
are
you
able
to
hear
your
own
sounds
the
sounds
of
your
breathing
this
is
the
practice
of
observation
without
judgment
it
is
not
about
what
you
find
but
that
you
are
looking
let
these
sounds
be
your
teacher
of
the
present
moment
experience
rather
than
a
distraction
begin
to
let
the
intensity
of
your
listening
fade
as
if
the
sounds
blur
into
the
background
of
your
focus
and
then
become
aware
of
what
you
can
see
while
you
likely
have
your
eyes
closed
do
you
see
blackness
on
the
inside
of
your
eyelids
or
do
you
detect
the
smallest
amount
of
light
coming
through
maybe
you
can
see
patches
or
swirls
of
color
take
a
moment
to
notice
all
that
you
can
see
inviting
your
attention
now
to
move
to
your
sense
of
smell
notice
the
most
prevalent
smell
you
can
detect
perhaps
it
is
the
scent
of
your
body
care
products
or
maybe
there
are
flowers
in
the
room
or
maybe
you
are
simply
aware
that
there
seems
to
be
no
specific
smell
around
you
remember
this
is
about
bringing
your
awareness
into
the
present
moment
by
noticing
your
senses
rather
than
judging
or
labeling
good
or
bad
let
your
awareness
move
now
to
anything
you
can
taste
do
you
notice
the
faint
taste
of
toothpaste
or
a
minty
gum
perhaps
you
're
aware
of
the
taste
of
your
last
drink
or
meal
still
lingering
inside
your
mouth
or
you
may
simply
notice
the
wet
sensation
in
your
mouth
allow
your
awareness
to
notice
what
your
physical
body
is
experiencing
now
feel
the
sensation
that
draws
your
attention
most
prominently
again
no
need
to
judge
or
label
good
or
bad
just
notice
[
Music
]
notice
the
areas
where
your
body
meets
the
support
beneath
you
become
aware
of
where
your
clothes
or
your
hair
subtly
brush
your
skin
[
Music
]
since
the
energy
where
one
part
of
your
body
is
touching
another
part
can
you
sense
the
vibrations
of
your
energy
what
do
you
feel
at
the
palms
of
your
hands
is
there
energy
vibrations
or
a
sense
of
buzzing
there
[
Music
]
do
you
feel
a
certain
temperature
in
your
fingertips
often
times
we
can
connect
to
our
own
innate
energy
simply
by
attending
to
the
energy
of
our
hands
what
is
the
volume
of
what
your
body
is
telling
you
are
there
areas
that
are
louder
than
others
asking
for
you
to
listen
are
there
any
subtle
messages
being
offered
within
you
[
Music

as
you
are
attending
to
the
sense
of
touch
in
various
ways
take
a
moment
to
soften
and
release
anywhere
you
can
since
the
shift
in
your
body
[

[

it
is
often
said
there
is
a
sixth
sense
the
sense
is
the
power
of
perception
similar
but
not
one
of
the
five
physical
senses
it
is
a
strong
intuitive
power
by
connecting
with
your
feelings
and
emotions
during
meditation
you
can
develop
this
instinct
or
sixth
sense
listen
inward
for
what
you
are
feeling
right
now
is
there
contentment
or
peace
[
Music

what
are
the
other
qualities
you
are
aware
of
when
you
quietly
observe
look
inward
not
inwards
or
labels
but
in
sensations
and
feelings
without
judgment
these
sensations
and
the
awareness
of
the
sensations
the
listening
inward
it
allows
you
to
connect
with
your
body
and
your
heart
listen
to
your
heart
what
do
you
hear
from
your
heart
right
now
[
Music

it
's
okay
if
it
seems
nothing
is
coming
to
you
now
it
will
this
is
the
practice
of
present
moment
observation
and
opening
to
the
possibilities
of
what
you
may
find
[
Music
]
we
practice
witnessing
the
present
moment
because
stress
is
experienced
when
living
in
the
past
or
the
future
peace
is
found
right
here
right
now
move
towards
peace
take
a
moment
longer
to
notice
your
senses
again
perhaps
you
can
become
aware
of
all
of
your
senses
at
the
same
time
or
choose
to
scan
through
them
each
again
take
another
deep
breath
with
your
eyes
still
closed
as
you
slowly
invite
your
field
of
awareness
to
broaden
outward
once
more
notice
sounds
sights
smells
tastes
and
feelings
as
you
are
beginning
to
open
your
field
of
awareness
and
sense
your
surroundings
see
if
you
can
do
so
while
you
continue
to
stay
connected
with
your
inner
experience
and
when
you
feel
ready
gradually
let
a
little
light
in
through
your
eyes
and
take
in
your
surroundings
once
more
continue
to
practice
using
your
senses
to
come
to
the
present
moment
any
time
throughout
your
day
to
experience
a
sense
of
peace
in
the
now
thank
you
so
much
for
practicing
with
me
today
I
hope
you
have
a
peaceful
and
calm
daywelcome
to
the
daily
calm
let
's
start
today
's
session
by
finding
a
comfortable
position
with
a
tall
straight
back
allow
your
arms
to
rest
gently
when
you
're
ready
close
your
eyes
bring
full
attention
to
this
very
moment
settling
in
and
allowing
the
mind
and
body
to
still
and
with
openness
patience
and
curiosity
bring
your
awareness
to
the
breath
a
deep
breath
in
and
releasing
it
fully
follow
the
breath
as
it
flows
in
and
out
of
your
body
taking
one
last
deep
breath
before
letting
the
breath
settle
allowing
it
to
feel
natural
and
easy
do
n't
try
to
force
the
breath
or
regulate
it
in
any
way
just
allow
it
to
flow
naturally
on
its
own
so
and
we
'll
scan
down
the
body
now
concentrating
our
attention
from
part
to
part
start
by
bringing
your
attention
to
the
top
of
your
head
and
scalp
feeling
whatever
's
happening
in
this
area
you
might
feel
tingling
or
heat
throbbing
or
soft
vibrations
there
may
be
strong
sensation
or
you
might
not
feel
much
at
all
now
lower
your
attention
to
your
forehead
face
and
jaw
allow
the
muscles
here
to
relax
on
your
next
out
breath
let
that
sensation
dissolve
lower
your
focus
to
the
neck
letting
the
throat
and
sides
and
back
of
the
neck
soften
notice
any
sensation
that
arises
on
the
surface
of
the
skin
or
deeper
within
now
bring
your
attention
to
your
shoulders
noticing
if
there
's
any
tension
or
strain
breathe
into
your
shoulders
and
if
any
parts
feel
tight
allow
them
to
relax
extend
your
awareness
down
the
arms
towards
the
wrists
palms
and
fingers
on
the
next
out
breath
allow
them
to
soften
now
come
to
the
chest
observing
the
rise
and
fall
of
each
breath
notice
how
the
lungs
expand
and
contract
direct
your
attention
to
your
upper
and
lower
back
there
may
be
some
intensity
is
this
is
an
area
where
we
commonly
hold
stress
if
you
notice
any
tension
or
warmth
or
discomfort
just
observe
what
's
there
with
each
breath
you
take
soften
just
a
little
bit
more
moving
your
focus
around
your
abdomen
notice
it
expanding
filling
up
with
air
and
slowly
emptying
on
the
exhale
and
bring
your
attention
to
your
pelvis
notice
where
your
body
makes
contact
with
the
ground
or
your
chair
and
direct
your
breath
into
this
area
relaxing
into
stillness
now
scan
your
legs
observing
your
thighs
notice
where
they
make
contact
with
your
cushion
or
chair
lowering
your
attention
to
your
knees
and
your
shins
and
calves
let
your
legs
soften
intentions
release
when
you
're
ready
breathe
into
your
ankles
your
feet
and
toes
let
them
relax
and
become
soft
sinking
into
a
state
of
relaxed
awareness
and
as
we
near
the
end
of
the
session
take
a
moment
to
notice
how
you
feel
you
may
find
that
you
're
more
relaxed
as
this
is
often
a
common
outcome
of
meditation
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
's
so
helpful
to
meditate
during
times
of
stress
when
we
're
experiencing
stress
our
amygdala
fires
up
and
it
's
difficult
to
make
thoughtful
decisions
so
if
we
find
our
mind
is
clouded
due
to
overwhelm
we
can
use
meditation
as
a
tool
to
calm
the
mind
down
ideally
we
want
to
meditate
in
a
preventative
way
so
we
do
n't
get
to
that
point
the
practice
is
here
for
you
whenever
you
need
it
and
as
we
near
the
end
of
the
session
bring
your
attention
back
to
the
room
wiggle
your
fingers
and
toes
and
slowly
open
your
eyes
i
hope
you
enjoyed
today
's
daily
con
i
invite
you
to
bring
this
state
of
peace
with
you
into
the
day
and
we
'll
see
you
back
here
tomorrow
youhey
dear
love
if
you
're
experiencing
negative
thoughts
that
's
okay
allow
yourself
to
be
okay
with
the
not
okayness
and
with
that
energy
around
you
give
yourself
permission
to
get
into
whatever
position
feels
comfortable
for
you
and
when
you
feel
ready
gently
close
your
eyes
turn
your
awareness
towards
your
breath
i
really
want
you
to
focus
on
your
belly
throughout
this
meditation
allow
your
lower
abdomen
to
expand
on
every
inhale
and
contract
on
every
exhale
all
the
while
allowing
your
upper
chest
to
remain
relatively
calm
still
and
neutral
this
helps
signal
to
our
body
that
we
are
safe
it
's
okay
to
slow
down
it
's
also
okay
to
listen
to
whatever
quote
unquote
negative
thoughts
that
are
going
on
within
you
because
truly
the
only
way
to
release
them
is
to
love
them
you
do
n't
need
to
love
the
thoughts
so
much
as
love
yourself
through
the
thoughts
a
simple
example
before
we
begin
the
practice
is
to
not
think
about
the
color
green
[
Music
]
what
happens
when
i
tell
you
to
not
think
about
the
color
green
[
Music
]
very
often
when
we
're
told
not
to
think
of
something
or
we
try
to
not
think
of
something
we
just
think
about
it
more
[
Music
]
when
we
instead
shift
our
focus
[
Music
]
that
's
when
we
can
start
to
change
but
it
all
begins
with
acceptance
and
love
so
whatever
the
key
prominent
negative
message
that
has
been
coming
up
for
you
is
present
simply
let
it
be
as
you
turn
into
your
breath
remember
stomach
expands
on
every
inhale
and
contracts
on
every
exhale
let
yourself
know
that
you
are
not
this
thought
and
it
's
okay
that
it
showed
up
all
of
our
quote
unquote
negative
thoughts
are
actually
just
teachers
in
disguise
so
recognize
if
only
for
a
moment
you
are
separate
from
this
thought
imagine
that
it
is
just
a
scared
wounded
part
of
your
own
child-like
self
and
extend
love
towards
it
for
whatever
piece
of
you
had
this
thought
is
likely
tied
to
some
scared
wound
within
a
frightened
inner
child
show
love
and
compassion
towards
yourself
for
whatever
you
're
feeling
tied
to
these
negative
emotions
let
yourself
know
you
are
here
for
yourself
you
are
here
to
love
and
accept
yourself
no
matter
what
thoughts
come
to
mind
no
matter
what
emotions
are
caused
by
the
thoughts
and
vice
versa
you
've
got
your
back
loving
yourself
in
this
way
may
bring
about
an
emotional
reaction
of
some
kind
simply
allow
whatever
you
experience
if
it
feels
good
to
you
you
may
even
embrace
yourself
wrapping
your
arms
around
yourself

it
may
bring
up
for
you

are

may

keep
them
there

let
them
come
back
down
to
your
sides
trust
whatever
feels
best
to
you
[
Music

and
as
you
let
yourself
be
present
with
both
this
thought
and
emotion
you
allow
yourself
to
get
clear
on
what
its
opposite
would
be
for
example
a
common
negative
thought
i
've
experienced
is
that
i
'm
not
good
enough
[

and
the
emotions
accompanying
our
despair
and
doubt
the
opposite
would
be
that
i
am
good
enough
i
am
more
than
enough

the
emotions
would
be

we
really
care

that
your

to
heal

your
unconscious
mind
is
an
expert
in
healing
and
balancing
in
a
safe
and
natural
way
while
you
can
just
flow
with
the

change
is
a
natural
aspect
of
life
like
a
tree
that
lets
go
of
its
leaves
the
seasons
changing
the
sea
changing
from
liquid
to
air
[

and
become
aware
of
your
breathing
imagine
now
that
you
're
breathing
in
that
life
energy
through
the
soles
of
your
feet
breathing
it
up
through
your
body

out
the

out

out

numb

in

in

there
is
no
right
or
wrong
way
to
flow
with
this
experience
there
is
an
old
story
about
a
buddha
statue
perhaps
your
arms
and
feet
will
get
heavier
as
you
listen
to
this
story
and
you
can
enjoy
that
in
your
own
way
because
people
can
you
know
experience
a
pleasant
deepening
sense
of
comfort
as
they
allow
their
body
to
relax
and
they
relax
deeply
in
the
mid
50s
a
monastery
was
to
be
relocated
to
make
room
for
a
new
highway
the
monks
arranged
for
a
crane
to
come
and
move
a
10
feet
tall
clay
buddha
to
its
new
location
when
the
crane
started
to
lift
the
statue
it
was
much
heavier
than
expected
and
it
began
to
crack
wanting
to
protect
the
priceless
shrine
the
monks
lowered
it
back
down
and
decided
to
wait
until
the
next
day
to
bring
more
powerful
equipment
to
add
insult
to
the
injury
the
rain
came
in
so
the
monks
covered
the
statue
with
tarps
to
keep
the
moisture
away
in
the
dark
of
night
the
head
monk
took
his
flashlight
and
went
out
to
make
sure
the
buddha
was
still
covered
when
the
light
of
the
flashlight
shone
into
the
crack
of
the
clay
he
saw
a
glimmer
a
reflection
of
something
underneath
the
shroud
of
clay
he
immediately
started
to
carefully
chisel
away
shards
of
clay
to
find
that
the
glimmer
grew
brighter
hours
later
when
all
the
clay
had
been
removed
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
buddha
made
of
solid
gold
as
you
continue
to
listen
the
positive
and
valuable
words
i
will
share
with
you
now
have
already
started
to
activate
a
process
of
chiseling
away
old
clay
of
worries
fear
stress
and
anxiety
in
your
subconscious
mind
and
this
will
continue
with
every
second
and
every
minute
with
every
breath
now
i
wonder
if
you
can
imagine
yourself
walking
on
a
warm
beach
this
can
be
any
beach
you
like
either
one
you
imagine
or
a
beach
you
know
you
are
there
by
yourself
imagine
walking
so
close
to
the
sea
that
some
of
the
waves
touch
your
feet
i
do
n't
know
what
you
notice
the
most
if
it
's
the
sound
of
the
waves
maybe
it
's
the
sight
of
the
sea
the
sky
the
sand
or
maybe
it
's
the
warmth
the
feeling
of
sand
and
water
on
your
skin
or
maybe
it
's
that
fresh
clean
and
high
vibrational
air
or
a
combination
suddenly
you
realize
that
there
is
a
thick
rope
tied
around
your
waist
behind
you
at
the
end
of
the
rope
there
is
a
big
old
anchor
that
weighs
heavy
from
accumulated
thoughts
worries
and
fears
from
the
past
and
about
the
future
they
hinder
you
they
have
held
you
back
berated
you
from
inner
peace
and
harmony
from
joy
and
freedom
the
rope
is
going
into
your
skin
with
each
step
in
front
of
you
now
further
ahead
something
glimmering
in
the
sand
catches
your
attention
you
walk
towards
it
dragging
that
heaviness
with
you
when
you
come
closer
to
it
you
realize
that
it
is
a
blade
it
looks
and
feels
like
it
is
from
ancient
times
like
there
is
an
energy
link
between
you
and
that
blade
[
Music

and
suddenly
you
notice
your
name
appears
on
the
handle
of
that
blade
while
a
part
of
you
is
curious
your
higher
self
knows
that
this
blade
is
here
for
a
reason
like
life
has
given
you
an
opportunity
chance
a
choice
to
deliberately
cut
the
rope
and
let
it
all
go
cut
the
rope
now
let
go
of
all
the
worries
and
unwanted
feelings
you
've
been
dragging
with
you
[
Music

maybe
you
feel
a
sense
of
relief
a
sense
of
freedom
lightness
or
something
else
maybe
your
body
is
working
through
this
in
its
own
way
some
people
even
shed
tears
and
shake
a
bit
when
they
finally
let
go
the
way
you
go
through
this
is
the
way
that
is
right
for
you
and
it
is
safe
for
you
to
let
go
now
imagine
the
waves
crashing
into
the
anchor
as
it
starts
to
magically
rust
to
pieces
right
before
your
very
eyes
it
is
safe
for
you
to
let
go
now
the
anchor
disappears
more
and
more
with
each
new
wave
the
rope
dissolves
while
it
floats
further
and
further
from
shore
imagine
the
sun
surrounding
you
with
a
radiant
light

shining
down

all
is
well
lovely
live

and
shine
your
beautiful
lightthanks
for
joining
me
today
for
another
mindful
tip
today
i
want
to
chat
about
stress
a
little
bit
you
probably
at
some
point
in
your
life
have
experienced
stress
anxiety
maybe
panic
maybe
sensations
of
air
hunger
freak
out
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
and
if
you
have
it
you
probably
know
someone
that
has
stress
is
really
important
to
our
physiology
it
's
something
that
we
actually
rely
on
to
survive
in
many
ways
unfortunately
in
today
's
world
the
mechanisms
around
stress
can
can
backfire
in
some
way
so
what
used
to
help
us
stay
alive
can
often
you
know
the
same
elegant
mechanism
designed
for
that
can
backfire
and
kind
of
disregulate
our
nervous
system
so
you
know
acute
stress
is
really
useful
but
over
time
chronic
stress
even
if
it
's
a
low
grade
can
really
disregulate
our
autonomic
nervous
system
and
that
could
influence
our
breathing
patterns
and
what
happens
is
once
our
breathing
pattern
is
affected
negatively
it
could
kind
of
feed
back
into
that
loop
meaning
now
that
you
're
not
breathing
uh
optimally
that
leads
to
more
chronic
stress
because
breathing
poorly
whether
it
's
you
know
your
mechanics
of
breathing
or
like
how
many
breaths
you
take
in
a
minute
or
so
forth
though
that
in
itself
can
be
a
stress
and
can
kind
of
feed
that
loop
now
the
cool
thing
is
is
we
we
could
interact
with
that
mechanism
somewhat
simply
so
today
i
wanted
to
give
like
one
style
of
breathing
that
i
find
really
useful
from
an
application
standpoint
in
everyday
life
now
the
breath
pattern
i
'm
gon
na
talk
about
today
there's
they
're
styles
that
have
been
used
that
tap
into
the
same
mechanism
for
a
really
long
time
so
if
you
study
yogic
breath
patterns
you
know
a
lot
of
them
cultivate
the
same
qualities
that
this
does
but
sometimes
to
really
practice
those
thoroughly
you
want
to
be
in
a
fairly
controlled
environment
you
want
to
be
sitting
still
in
a
room
you
want
to
have
probably
no
responsibilities
on
your
calendar
for
the
next
20-30
minutes
whereas
what
i
'd
like
to
talk
about
today
i
feel
can
be
inserted
into
your
life
a
lot
easier
uh
more
often
for
less
amount
of
time
so
the
application
um
you
know
really
presents
an
opportunity
for
us
when
we
're
trying
to
navigate
the
stresses
especially
acute
stresses
of
our
life
especially
if
you
tend
towards
like
anxiety
panic
and
sometimes
feelings
or
sensations
of
air
hunger
like
you
ca
n't
get
enough
breath
oftentimes
what
happens
when
we
feel
that
way
we
can
make
things
worse
by
breathing
faster
or
deeper
everybody
's
heard
the
term
you
know
relax
take
a
deep
breath
and
in
some
ways
that
could
be
helpful
but
there
's
also
ways
where
that
deep
breath
if
it
's
rapid
can
exacerbate
our
situation
so
this
pattern
probably
falls
under
the
style
of
buteyko
breathing
that
you
might
be
familiar
with
and
if
you
're
not
i
definitely
recommend
a
deep
dive
in
that
realm
and
it
taps
into
one
of
the
qualities
that
i
think
is
important
to
develop
and
kind
of
it
's
important
muscle
to
flex
and
that
would
be
carbon
dioxide
tolerance
so
carbon
dioxide
is
often
thought
of
as
like
a
waste
product
that
's
not
useful
to
us
but
it
's
actually
really
important
when
dealing
with
anxiety
or
stress
and
carbon
dioxide
is
a
excuse
me
i
got
some
critters
behind
me
making
noise
carbon
dioxide
is
a
signaling
molecule
that
our
body
relies
on
it
plays
a
role
in
regulating
the
ph
of
our
body
and
in
doing
so
it
signals
our
body
's
release
of
oxygen
from
hemoglobin
into
our
tissues
so
oftentimes
when
we
're
breathing
poorly
because
we
're
stressed
or
if
we're
stressed
because
we
're
breathing
poorly
we
'll
have
a
sensation
like
we
're
not
getting
enough
air
and
sometimes
that
means
because
our
oxygen
is
low
and
our
carbon
dioxide
is
high
but
in
building
tolerance
to
that
level
of
carbon
dioxide
we
can
shift
those
sensations
so
we
could
shift
the
experience
that
we
have
in
the
moment
to
what
we
feel
like
we
're
not
getting
enough
air
to
a
place
where
we
feel
calm
and
that
our
breathing
is
not
a
problem
it
's
kind
of
a
fascinating
concept
that
seems
contradictory
at
first
until
you
try
it
and
some
folks
will
struggle
when
trying
this
at
least
at
first
but
it
works
it
's
really
great
i
personally
have
relied
on
it
many
times
and
i
think
it
's
an
important
tool
to
have
in
our
tool
kit
when
things
just
arrive
in
our
day-to-day
situation
where
we
notice
that
you
know
our
breathing
is
off
and
we
're
and
we
're
feeling
stressed
and
on
the
edge
of
anxiety
or
panic
the
idea
here
in
general
is
to
slow
down
your
breath
to
take
fewer
breaths
and
the
way
i
like
to
do
this
and
the
way
i
've
taught
many
folks
where
they
could
successfully
integrate
it
is
by
first
focusing
on
the
inhale
so
as
you're
inhaling
to
try
to
take
in
your
breath
slower
so
the
tendency
might
be
to
breathe
more
and
to
breathe
faster
so
that
you
can
breathe
more
but
to
actually
do
the
opposite
which
could
feel
uncomfortable
at
first
and
what
you
're
looking
to
do
is
kind
of
flirt
with
this
edge
of
discomfort
where
it
's
a
little
uncomfortable
but
you
can
do
it
and
if
at
any
point
it
's
too
uncomfortable
you
could
take
a
deep
breath
breathe
naturally
and
kind
of
reset
and
start
over
but
think
of
your
breath
being
like
a
wave
where
you
have
an
inhale
and
an
exhale
and
the
idea
here
is
to
slow
down
that
inhale
maybe
not
take
as
much
air
and
then
let
your
exhale
kind
of
drag
out
and
some
folks
will
even
try
to
create
a
little
breath
hold
at
the
end
of
the
exhale
which
is
useful
but
not
necessary
so
a
good
place
to
start
if
you
want
to
apply
structure
so
you
have
something
to
focus
on
like
a
count
what
i
recommend
would
be
to
breathe
in
for
a
count
of
three
and
out
for
a
count
of
three
and
very
quickly
let
the
exhale
become
longer
so
maybe
your
desire
would
be
to
breathe
in
for
four
or
five
but
like
slow
that
down
do
n't
take
as
much
air
in
and
then
try
to
relax
the
body
on
the
exhale
so
you
're
taking
that
wave
and
you
're
making
it
smaller
in
height
essentially
and
stretching
it
out
so
the
goal
would
be
to
eventually
take
fewer
breaths
over
a
given
amount
of
time
by
slowing
them
down
one
thing
that
also
might
help
focusing
on
this
is
the
sound
that
your
breath
makes
generally
if
you
take
a
deep
or
fast
breath
it
'll
have
an
audible
sound
that
you
could
hear
from
i
do
n't
know
from
the
inside
of
your
head
somewhere
so
think
of
breathing
where
it
doesn't
really
make
a
sound
so
slowing
it
down
where
there
's
not
a
lot
of
wind
your
breath
is
creating
and
not
a
lot
of
sound
that
it
's
generating
so
very
slow
soft
inhale
and
then
on
the
exhale
over
your
breath
cycles
allowing
that
to
drag
out
longer
and
longer
and
what
i
like
to
do
on
that
exhale
is
try
to
relax
my
body
so
maybe
starting
with
the
stomach
somewhere
that
feels
somewhat
central
to
where
the
activity
of
the
breath
is
and
relaxing
it
maybe
relaxing
the
belly
maybe
relaxing
the
neck
or
shoulders
if
there
's
an
area
that
you
know
you
have
a
tendency
of
holding
tension
maybe
focusing
on
relaxing
that
area
on
the
exhale
and
if
you
can
get
to
a
point
where
you
're
in
for
three
and
maybe
out
for
9
or
10
or
12
which
might
take
a
few
sessions
to
to
get
to
what
i
find
happens
is
within
a
fairly
short
period
of
time
the
way
your
nervous
system
feels
like
it
's
being
expressed
it
just
transforms
so
you
can
go
to
a
place
that
you
know
you
're
on
edge
you
're
stressed
right
now
in
this
moment
feeling
sensations
of
anxiety
right
now
and
within
just
a
few
minutes
um
really
coming
out
to
a
different
place
where
that
sensation
has
really
diminished
which
is
an
exciting
thing
it
's
like
another
example
of
what
role
we
could
play
in
our
sense
of
well-being
now
this
could
be
done
really
in
any
position
i
think
because
of
the
nature
of
how
this
is
just
slowly
incorporated
you
can
do
this
while
you
you
're
walking
uh
you
know
you
're
on
a
walk
you
can
do
it
seated
um
i
would
maybe
be
careful
doing
it
when
driving
but
you
know
it
could
be
integrated
in
a
lot
of
different
positions
like
wherever
your
orientation
is
it
could
even
be
played
with
during
light
levels
of
exercise
movement
if
you
're
having
difficulty
doing
it
especially
if
you
have
the
tendency
of
really
breathing
up
here
where
your
sternum
and
your
shoulders
are
lifting
on
your
inhale
and
you
struggle
with
getting
your
breath
to
go
more
south
in
direction
the
thing
the
position
that
i
feel
is
most
useful
would
be
laying
prone
meaning
laying
on
your
belly
and
what
that
does
is
it
allows
gravity
to
the
weight
of
your
body
to
kind
of
hold
your
rib
cage
in
place
a
little
bit
so
that
you
're
there
's
there
's
a
lot
of
movement
in
your
ribs
when
you
breathe
but
ideally
it
's
not
so
much
north
it's
more
east
west
so
when
you
're
laying
on
your
belly
the
weight
of
your
body
can
hold
your
sternum
in
place
a
little
bit
and
it
allows
it
easier
to
direct
your
breath
more
downward
and
expand
more
laterally
so
if
you
find
yourself
having
trouble
with
this
from
a
seated
or
standing
or
walking
position
then
just
just
lay
down
especially
in
the
moment
if
you
're
in
a
moment
where
you're
really
experiencing
anxiety
and
you
want
to
see
what
you
're
capable
of
doing
do
n't
worry
about
trying
to
do
it
in
a
more
i
do
n't
want
to
say
advanced
but
you
know
while
you
're
doing
something
else
just
lay
down
on
your
belly
you
could
just
put
one
hand
on
top
of
the
other
put
your
forehead
on
your
hands
or
maybe
if
it
's
more
comfortable
turn
your
head
to
the
side
and
put
a
cheek
on
your
hands
and
just
focus
on
slowing
your
inhale
and
then
letting
your
exhale
get
longer
and
longer
every
cycle
and
trying
to
relax
your
body
on
that
exhale
it
's
a
very
effective
pattern
i
encourage
you
to
give
it
a
try
practice
it
when
you
're
not
in
a
place
of
anxiety
or
stress
so
that
you
feel
a
little
bit
more
comfortable
and
then
see
if
you
could
remember
in
the
moment
where
you
are
experiencing
uh
increased
stress
or
anxiety
you
know
you
could
say
oh
i
know
what
to
do
now
i
've
practiced
this
and
then
go
for
it
and
then
please
let
the
community
know
what
you
notice
so
maybe
in
the
comments
you
know
give
it
a
try
and
let
us
know
what
what
you
experience
when
you
practice
this
pattern
and
if
you
want
to
learn
more
about
different
styles
that
tap
in
to
these
concepts
the
school
of
book
tako
breathing
is
an
excellent
resource
and
it
's
not
hard
to
find
information
or
videos
about
that
so
i
hope
you
enjoyed
this
uh
this
tip
and
if
you
know
someone
that
experiences
anxiety
and
stress
on
a
regular
basis
especially
if
it
's
like
sensations
of
panic
and
air
hunger
this
is
a
very
useful
strategy
so
please
send
it
their
way
i
hope
you
enjoyed
have
a
great
day-

Hi
,
and
welcome
to
this
meditation
for
self-love
.
(
gentle
meditative
music
)
I
'd
like
to
invite
you
to
gently
close
your
eyes
and
take
a
nice
,
slow
,
deep
breath
in
,
deeper
than
you
've
taken
all
day
so
far
.
And
as
you
exhale
,
concentrate
on
the
sound
of
my
voice
,
allowing
it
to
ground
you
into
the
present
moment
.
And
give
yourself
permission
right
now
to
focus
on
you
,
making
yourself
your
first
priority
.
There
's
nowhere
else
you
need
to
be
.
There
's
nothing
else
you
need
to
be
doing
,
except
giving
yourself
this
time
for
your
own
care
,
for
your
own
well-being
.
Continue
breathing
,
allowing
each
inhale
to
be
a
bit
deeper
than
the
one
before
it
,
feeling
your
lungs
expand
out
as
you
inhale
,
and
feeling
everything
contract
back
in
as
you
exhale
.
Returning
your
breath
now
to
its
normal
pattern
and
its
normal
rhythm
,
but
continue
to
follow
the
journey
of
your
breath
through
your
entire
body
.
Feeling
it
weave
in
and
out
of
your
muscles
and
your
cells
.
Allowing
it
to
still
you
,
and
ease
any
tension
or
tightness
you
may
be
feeling
.
Now
I
'd
like
you
to
turn
your
attention
to
the
bottom
half
of
your
body
,
everything
from
your
hips
all
the
way
down
to
the
tips
of
your
toes
.
Breathing
into
them
.
Noticing
any
judgments
that
come
up
about
any
of
these
areas
.
We
all
have
parts
of
our
body
that
we
wish
were
different
,
but
instead
of
judging
them
,
now
turn
your
focus
to
sending
love
and
appreciation
into
these
areas
.
Shifting
your
focus
now
to
your
upper
body
,
from
your
stomach
to
the
crown
of
your
head
,
feeling
into
these
areas
,
noticing
any
tension
or
tightness
you
may
be
having
,
breathing
into
that
area
to
help
it
release
.
Noticing
any
judgments
that
come
up
in
these
areas
.
And
gently
,
replacing
that
judgment
with
love
and
appreciation
.
And
now
begin
to
call
to
mind
other
parts
of
yourself
that
you
've
held
in
judgment
in
the
past
,
maybe
a
thought
pattern
or
a
behavior
you
exhibited
.
Maybe
it
was
a
choice
you
made
,
or
something
you
said
you
wish
you
could
take
back
.
Maybe
a
time
where
you
felt
you
could
have
handled
something
better
.
Look
at
it
from
a
place
of
total
curiosity
.
Watch
the
judgment
come
up
,
because
it
will
,
and
watch
the
stories
that
you
've
told
yourself
about
the
situation
come
up
,
because
they
will
,
too
.
And
then
gently
let
those
go
,
and
offer
yourself
forgiveness
,
knowing
that
you
were
doing
the
best
you
could
at
that
time
.
And
now
as
we
move
into
the
silent
part
of
the
meditation
,
continue
this
journey
on
your
own
,
calling
to
mind
any
parts
of
yourself
that
you
hold
in
judgment
,
and
giving
them
unconditional
love
,
acceptance
,
and
forgiveness
.
Continue
breathing
with
your
eyes
closed
.
Let
your
attention
start
to
focus
back
on
my
voice
.
When
we
judge
parts
of
ourself
,
we
actually
hold
them
separate
from
us
,
and
if
we
're
holding
parts
of
ourself
separate
,
then
we
ca
n't
feel
whole
.
Real
self
love
is
holding
our
light
with
the
dark
,
of
loving
those
parts
of
ourselves
unconditionally
we
previously
held
in
judgment
.
No
one
else
can
do
this
for
us
.
Give
yourself
all
the
love
that
you
need
.
It
's
inside
you
.
Now
let
's
take
three
more
deep
breaths
together
,
a
deep
inhale
in
,
holding
it
for
a
beat
,
and
exhale
it
out
.
Again
,
an
even
deeper
breath
than
the
one
before
,
feeling
that
breath
weave
in
and
out
of
all
of
your
muscles
and
cells
.
And
exhale
out
.
Last
time
,
your
deepest
breath
yet
,
sending
that
oxygen
all
the
way
down
to
the
tips
of
your
toes
,
and
as
you
exhale
,
feel
it
traveling
back
up
your
body
,
and
when
it
hits
the
top
of
your
head
,
and
you
're
ready
,
you
can
open
your
eyes
.
Thank
you
for
joining
me
for
this
meditation
and
giving
yourself
this
gift.Hello
and
welcome
to
this
healing
session
for
anxiety
.
Get
into
a
comfortable
and
relaxed
position
and
just
let
go
of
all
your
daily
stresses
.
Allow
yourself
to
just
be
here
and
now
,
letting
your
body
just
be
.
You
do
n't
have
to
do
anything
because
our
bodies
naturally
want
to
be
calm
and
relaxed
.
Sometimes
thinking
too
much
or
being
tense
and
being
anxious
doesn
’
t
allow
for
us
to
relax
.
So
naturally
,
we
must
let
go
of
any
need
to
control
the
present
moment
and
future
outcomes
.
We
feel
anxious
because
we
tend
to
over-analyze
what
we
think
will
happen
today
,
tomorrow
or
next
week
.
We
do
this
out
of
habit
because
in
the
past
,
situations
and
outcomes
that
didn
’
t
happen
the
way
we
expected
,
and
we
tend
to
feel
that
we
need
to
be
in
control
and
be
worried
.
In
order
to
change
this
habit
,
we
must
change
our
self-image
and
create
new
beliefs
.
That
's
what
this
session
will
teach
you
,
but
first
,
we
need
to
get
in
a
relaxed
state
and
go
within
,
calming
our
mind
with
some
breathing
.
I
will
count
down
and
with
it
number
I
say
I
want
to
fully
inhale
with
your
belly
out
and
exhale
tightening
your
belly
.
And
with
each
breath
,
you
will
feel
more
and
more
relaxed
,
taking
you
into
a
deep
state
of
peace
.
I
will
count
down
now
.
5
...
Take
a
full
in
breath
and
as
you
exhale
feel
the
tension
loosen
a
little
bit
.
4
...
Take
a
nice
deep
breath
in
and
as
you
exhale
you
feel
even
more
relaxed
and
tensions
let
go
.
3
...
Full
breath
in
...
and
out
.
Your
mind
is
becoming
calm
and
clear
.
2
...
Inhale
deeply
and
when
you
exhale
observe
how
the
need
to
control
subsides
as
you
become
extremely
relaxed
.
1
...
As
you
take
your
last
breath
and
exhale
slowly
you
feel
any
tension
is
gone
,
and
you
are
in
complete
peace
and
tranquility.So
,
to
reduce
anxiety
,
start
by
taking
a
moment
to
relax
your
body
..
soften
any
unnecessary
tension
in
your
belly
and
shoulder
,
and
find
a
posture
that
feels
both
relaxed
and
alert
.
Now
close
your
eyes
or
look
downwards
and
rest
your
hands
in
an
easy
effortless
way
.
Take
a
few
moments
to
scan
your
awareness
through
the
sensations
of
your
body
,
and
wherever
possible
,
soften
and
release
obvious
areas
of
physical
tension
.
Relax
your
breath
,
and
breathe
in
through
your
nose
and
out
through
your
mouth
.
This
may
be
a
little
unfamiliar
,
but
when
done
is
a
natural
,
easy
going
way
,
it
can
be
a
very
relaxing
way
to
breathe
.
In
through
your
nose
and
out
through
your
mouth
.
In
through
your
nose
and
out
through
your
mouth
.
Now
let
your
belly
be
soft
.
If
the
belly
is
soft
,
more
oxygen
goes
to
the
bottom
of
the
lungs
.
There
’
s
better
oxygen
exchange
.
Oxygen
moves
more
easily
into
the
blood
,
and
it
goes
to
all
the
cells
in
the
body
,
including
the
cells
in
the
brain
,
supplying
your
brain
with
the
nourishment
it
needs
.
If
the
belly
is
soft
,
it
helps
to
activate
the
vagus
nerve
.
Vagus
means
wandering
,
and
this
nerve
wanders
up
through
the
abdomen
and
chest
,
back
to
the
central
nervous
system
in
the
brain
,
and
it
promotes
relaxation
.
It
is
an
antidote
to
the
fight
or
flight
stress
response.the
idea
of
being
in
the
present
moment
is
a
powerful
one
when
it
comes
to
anxiety
depression
and
calming
an
overactive
mind
depression
can
arise
when
thinking
about
and
living
in
the
past
anxiety
can
show
up
when
thinking
about
and
living
in
the
future
when
your
thoughts
are
in
the
past
or
the
future
an
overthinking
mind
can
bring
turmoil
to
your
world
and
your
overall
experience
today
release
these
feelings
calm
the
overactive
mind
and
experience
peace
in
this
present
moment
this
mindfulness
meditation
can
be
used
to
focus
on
the
present
moment
and
let
go
of
worries
about
the
past
and
anxieties
about
the
future

one
point

of
you

be
a
spot
on
the
floor

the
wall
whatever
draws
your
attention
narrow
your
focus
on
this
one
single
point
and
allow
everything
in
the
background
to
blur
or
fade
away
see
all
there
is
to
notice
about
this
one
point
now
slowly
broaden
your
field
of
view
like
a
camera
lens
widening
with
a
relaxed
awareness
notice
everything
you
can
see
in
your
current
line
of
you
without
turning
your

different

and
now
slowly
narrow
your

of

once
more
to
the

single
point
that
you
started
with
and
as
your

continues
to
narrow
draw
it
in
until
your
eyes
gradually
closed
and
you
allow
your
attention
to
turn
inward
[
Music

as
you
begin
to
look
inside
and
settle
physically
start
with
three
deep
breaths
in
through
your
nose
and
out
through
your
mouth
like
a
sigh
take
these
three
breaths
at
your
own
pace
welcoming
a
slowing
down
of
the
momentum
of
your
energy
to
gradually
find
stillness
[

now
begin
to
count
your
breath
in
then
as
you
breathe
out
encourage
your
exhale
to
be
one
count
longer
than
your
inhale
[
Music

allow
each
exhale
to
carry
away
with
it
any
physical
and
emotional
stress
and
tension
by
exhaling
longer
than
you
inhale
your
breath
will
slow
and
your
body
will
calm
down
[
Music

you
can
consciously
relax
do
this
for
a
few
more
breaths
cycles
on
your
own
now
enjoy
the
easy
flow
of
your
natural
breath
feel
the
cool
air
as
it
passes
in
through
your
nostrils
and
fills
you
up
[
Music

encourage
each
natural
out-breath
to
release
any
remaining
tension
you
may
be
feeling
as
you
observe
your
breath
you
can
allow
it
to
naturally
slow
down
become
aware
of
your
physical
experience
[
Music

with
your
minds
I
notice
first
the
palms
of
your
hands
notice
the
energy
here
perhaps
you
feel
this
as
warmth
or
tingling
or
a
buzzing
sensation
notice
how
simply
moving
your
awareness
to
this
part
of
your
body
moves
your
energy
to
this
point
by
simply
paying
attention
you
have
the
ability
to
move
energy
and
move
a
positive
sensation
within
you
similar
to
broadening
your
visual
focal
point
begin
to
widen
the
experience
of
your
sensations
outward
moving
from
your
hands
to
awaken
to
the
sensations
in
your
body
since
the
aliveness
in
your
hands
and
in
your
feet
feel
the
energy
moving
within
you
let
your
attention
drift
through
the
sensations
in
your
body
without
directing
it
and
without
judging
what
you
find
and
by
you
're
moving
attention
on
your
body
to
direct
your
energy
and
your
thoughts
simply
allow
your
focus
to
tune
into
the
sensations
of
your
body
right
here
right
now
[
Music

when
you
can
do
this
live
in
this
body
since
your
own
aliveness
you
are
in
the
present
and
living
in
the
space
between
your
thoughts
when
your
mind
is
attentive
to
the
sensations
of
your
body
you
can
pause
you
can
extend
the
gap
between
your
thoughts
in
this
space
is
where
you
can
experience
peace
and
calm

notice
if
there
is
anywhere
you
can
soften
a
little
more
look
for
anywhere
you
can
let
go
even
deeper
into
relaxation
and
ease
let
your
physical
body
go
so
that
you
can
let
your
thoughts
go
and
now
as
I
say
each
part
of
your
body
let
your
focus
move
to
each
part
and
encourage
or
release
a
complete
relaxation
to
find
ease
in
your
body
by
simply
moving
your
awareness
throughout
your
body
as
I
mentioned
each
part
allow
the
surface
below
you
to
support
you
fully
so
there
is
no
need
to
hold
your
position
and
you
can
be
completely
relaxed
become
aware
of
your
feet
notice
this
area
and
simply
relax
move
your
attention
up
from
your
feet
and
begin
to
release
your
lower
legs
and
knees
feel
how
each
part
of
your
body
becomes
heavy
and
goes
deeper
into
relaxation
as
you
allow
it
to
let
go
and
now
find
a
sense
of
ease
in
your
thighs
and
hips
as
you
let
go
completely
moving
up
noticing
the
area
of
your
lower
back
and
abdomen
take
a
deep
breath
to
move
your
energy
and
attention
here
to
release
any
tightness
in
your
lower
back
continue
this
process
of
increasing
your
comfort
by
moving
your
attention
and
therefore
your
energy
as
you
do
this
welcome
a
feeling
of
softening
into
your
abdomen
let
your
chest
and
arms
rest
heavy
on
the
surface
below
you
moving
your
attention
upward
feel
as
your
neck
and
throat
release
any
physical
and
emotional
tension
you
may
be
holding
on
to
notice
now
the
hinges
of
your
jaw
allow
your
jaw
to
unclench
relaxing
deeper
and
deeper
still
feel
as
the
small
muscles
of
your
cheeks
eyes
and
forehead
soften
and
they
go
you
may
notice
that
as
the
small
muscles
in
your
face
and
jaw
let
go
the
rest
of
your
body
follows
and
softens
even
more
still
now
your
whole
body
is
heavy
relaxed
and
that
ease
you
may
sense
that
you
are
safe
and
supported
and
you
are
open
to
guiding
yourself
into
a
calm
state
of
mind
let
yourself
go
let
your
mind
and
body
go
to
a
deep
and
relaxed
State
[

and
now
that
you
are
fully
relaxed
you
can
begin
the
inward
inquiry
process
by
checking
in
with
what
is
true
for
you
notice
what
you
are
actually
feeling
giving
yourself
permission
to
experience
in
this
present
moment
without
trying
to
change
anything
let
your
thoughts
come
and
go
there
is
no
need
to
attach
to
them
or
follow
your
thoughts
imagine
your
thoughts
are
like
a
river
flowing
gently
downstream
let
your
thoughts
go
so
you
can
be
here
now
awake
to
the
sensations
in
your
body
let
your
thoughts
go
so
you
can
make
room
for
the
truth
to
surface
in
whatever
form
a
comes
simply
allow
it
to
surface
make
space
for
awareness
and
acceptance
without
judgment

I
'm
Sara
Raymond
welcome
to
the

movement
here
we
are
an
oasis
where
you
can
come
to
tap
into
your
inner

positive
mindset
and
the
ability
for
self
healing
as
we
begin
to
settle
in
for
this
sleep
meditation
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
as
comfortable
as
possible
close
your
eyes
and
allow
my
voice
to
be
your
guide
into
deep
healing
relaxation
give

permission
to
let
go
into
the
darkness
of
sleep
for
the
night
give
yourself
the
gift
of
healing
rest
and
know
deep
down
that
you
deserve
it
allow
yourself
the
opportunity
to
relax

there
is
no
need
to

to
everything
I
say
let
relaxation
and
sleep
come
to
you
easily
welcoming
a
slowing
down
of
the
momentum
of
your
energy
to
gradually
find
stillness
begin
to
connect
with
your
breath
and
if
it
feels
right
to
you
take
a
long
slow
deep
breath
in
hold
it
for
a
moment
and
then
slowly
exhale
fully
empty
out
and
allow
any
tension
to
melt
away
as
you
gradually
relax
more
and
more
deeply
with
each
breath
as
you
continue
to
breathe
intentionally
allow
your
exhale
to
be
slightly
longer
than
your

to
welcome
ease
and
relaxation
to
flow
throughout
your
entire
body

another
long
slow
deep

in
pausing
again

then
exhale
empty
your

completely
with
your
out-breath

again
take
a
deep
breath
in

to
your

that
it
is
your
time
to
fully
relax
take
your
time
hold
for
a
moment
and
then
let
it
go
perhaps
you
can
already
feel
yourself
drifting
into
a
deep
state
of
relaxation
like
the
leaves
being
released
from
the
trees
in
the
season
of
fall
you
can
let
go
to
make
room
for
new
possibilities
to
develop
and
present
themselves
in

consider
each
breath
out
as
a
time
for
releasing
any
unwanted
energies
and
allowing
the
energy
that
you
do
desire
to
develop

as
you
are
for
an
even
deeper
connection
with
yourself
surrender
to
your
breath
feel
your
body
being
breathed
being
moved
by
your
breath
trust
it
's
okay
simply
breathe
and
notice
[
Music

notice
the
sounds
in
your
environment
just
as
they
are
here
are
the
sounds
as
they
come
to
you
without
searching
them
out
allow
the
subtle
noises
to
drift
into
your
awareness
with
simple
curiosity
take
interest
in
the
sounds
just
as
they
are
simply
allow
the
sounds
to
be
rather
than
seeing
them
as
a
distraction
or
an
obstacle
if
you
can
practice
accepting
the
sounds
just
as
they
are
without
the
desire
to
change
you
can
also
begin
to
practice
acceptance
and
surrender
in
other
areas
of
your
life
frequently
the
word
surrender
has
a
negative
energy
to
it
you
may
think
of
having
to
give
up
something
that
is
important
to
you
or
lose
control
over
a
situation
Surrender
does
not
mean
giving
up
when
the
word
surrender
is
used
as
a
mindfulness
practice
it
can
also
be
the
opportunity
to
give
up
anything
that
is
no
longer
serving
you
or
anything
that
is
keeping
you
stuck

consider
this
beautiful
quote
by
Debbie
Ford
surrender
is
a
gift
that
you
can
give
yourself
it
's
an
act
of
faith
it's
saying
that
even
though
I
ca
n't
see
where
the
river
is
flowing
I
trust
it
will
take
me
in
the
right

any
obstacle
or
challenge
in
your
life
might
actually
be
taking
you
in
the
right
direction
allow
the
flow
of
the
energy
of
life
[
Music

when
you
feel
life
brings
you
challenges
you
ca
n't
accept
you
have
the
opportunity
to
be
transformed
by
acceptance
you
may
add
suffering
when
you
resist
the
way
things
are
because
they
are
n't
the
way
you
expect
or
want
them
to
be
[
Music

you
have
the
choice
to
let
the
resistance
dissolve
when
you
accept
the
way
things
are
naturally
there
is
a
possibility
for
change
only
after
the
reality
has
been
accepted
and
believed
to
be
true
peace
is
available
when
you
stop
resisting
any
given
moment
[

although
you
do
n't
have
control
of
what
goes
on
beyond
yourself
you
do
have
a
choice
as
to
how
you
respond
to
your
experience
and
this
choice
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
experience
in
our
peace
you
can
decide
your
attitude
in
any
given
circumstance
noticing
the
sensations
in
your

with
a
relaxed

once
more
since
that
you
now
feel
as
if
the
weight
of
tension
has
been
lifted
and
released
from

you
sense
that
you
are
feeling
lighter
now
almost
as
if
you
are
floating
and
gravity
has
let
go
of
its
effects
on

[

this
lightness
comes
from
letting
go

weighing
on
you
both
physically

lifted
completely
out

Just
as
you
take
food
into
your
body
,
consuming
both
healthy
and
not-so-healthy
options
,
you
also
consume
media
throughout
the
day
.
You
listen
to
music
,
watch
TV
,
read
the
news
,
and
so
on
.
Although
these
may
provide
knowledge
and
entertainment
,
they
can
also
create
anxiety
and
stress
in
our
minds
and
bodies
or
take
us
away
from
our
connection
to
the
mind
.
This
exercise
offers
a
few
different
ways
to
bring
mindfulness
to
these
moments
of
consumption
.
They
don
’
t
necessarily
need
to
be
done
step-by-step
.
First
,
consider
what
the
impact
may
be
of
what
you
are
choosing
to
consume
.
Are
you
reading
the
news
to
inform
yourself
,
or
to
fuel
frustration
?
Perhaps
the
television
show
you
watch
has
quite
a
bit
of
violence
and
gets
your
nervous
system
going
.
This
isn
’
t
to
label
a
show
,
story
,
or
song
as
good
or
bad
.
It
’
s
merely
about
recognizing
the
effects
of
your
choice
.
As
you
consume
the
piece
of
media
,
notice
the
response
of
the
mind
and
body
.
If
you
are
watching
TV
,
mute
the
volume
during
commercials
to
check
in
with
yourself.Please
find
a
sitting
position
that
allows
you
to
be
alert
,
your
spine
erect
but
not
rigid
,
and
also
relaxed
.
Now
close
your
eyes
and
rest
your
hands
in
an
easy
effortless
way
.
Take
a
few
moments
to
scan
through
your
body
,
and
wherever
possible
,
soften
and
release
obvious
areas
of
physical
tension
.
We
begin
the
practice
of
coming
back
by
establishing
our
home
base
.
While
there
are
many
possible
anchors
such
as
sound
or
sensations
throughout
the
body
,
the
most
common
and
the
one
we
’
ll
be
exploring
here
is
the
breath
.
Please
breathe
naturally
and
simply
notice
where
the
breath
is
easiest
to
detect
and
where
the
breath
also
feels
pleasant
or
at
least
neutral
.
So
you
might
be
paying
attention
to
how
the
breath
feels
as
it
flows
in
and
out
of
your
nose
,
you
might
feel
the
touch
of
your
breath
around
your
nostrils
or
on
your
upper
lip
,
or
perhaps
you
feel
the
movement
of
your
chest
or
the
rising
and
falling
of
your
abdomen
,
or
perhaps
you
feel
your
whole
body
like
a
balloon
expanding
with
the
in
breath
,
deflating
with
the
out
breath
.
So
just
take
some
moments
to
bring
your
attention
to
the
sensations
of
breathing
in
one
of
these
areas
,
a
relaxed
attentiveness
.
There
’
s
no
need
to
control
the
breath
.
Rather
,
sense
you
’
re
receiving
the
breath
much
like
you
’
d
listen
to
sound
.
With
a
relaxed
awareness
,
discover
what
the
breath
is
really
like
as
a
changing
experience
of
sensations.it
has
been
said
that
how
you
love
yourself
is
how
you
teach
others
to
love
you
to
be
the
best
person
you
can
be
to
have
the
ability
to
help
and
support
those
loved
ones
surrounding
you
you
need
to
first
love
and
care
for
yourself
the
idea
of
self-care
does
n't
always
mean
going
out
to
the
spa
and
getting
pampered
it

Hey
there
,
I
'm
John
,
and
welcome
to
our
meditation
.
If
you
're
having
a
hard
time
right
now
,
it
's
okay
,
you
are
not
alone
and
there
is
help
.
You
can
reach
out
to
a
loved
one
,
a
friend
,
a
colleague
or
medical
resources
.
If
you
're
suffering
from
severe
depression
or
having
harmful
thoughts
,
please
reach
out
to
your
local
suicide
prevention
resources
.
Links
are
in
the
description
of
this
video
.
Go
ahead
and
settle
into
a
position
you
can
comfortably
hold
for
a
while
.
Be
gentle
with
yourself
and
honor
what
your
body
wants
.
And
if
you
can
,
try
to
avoid
a
position
you
'd
fall
asleep
in
.
Noticing
your
connection
to
your
feet
on
the
floor
or
your
legs
on
the
chair
.
Allow
these
to
ground
you
down
to
the
floor
where
it
's
still
and
solid
.
Place
one
hand
on
your
heart
and
one
hand
on
your
lower
belly
.
Close
your
eyes
or
let
them
gaze
downward
towards
the
floor
gently
.
And
inhale
slowly
and
deeply
through
your
nose
,
into
your
lower
belly
.
And
feeling
the
hand
on
your
belly
move
outward
as
it
fills
with
air
.
Mother
hand
on
your
chest
remains
gentle
and
still
.
Now
slowly
exhale
all
of
the
air
out
of
your
body
as
if
you
were
blowing
out
candles
on
a
cake
.
Feeling
your
belly
contract
back
in
.
And
again
breathing
deeply
into
your
lower
belly
,
feeling
that
inhale
weaving
in
and
out
of
your
muscles
and
yourselves
,
nourishing
your
body
,
beginning
to
allow
you
to
feel
lighter
,
clearer
,
more
still
.
And
as
you
exhale
,
allow
the
breath
to
gently
begin
to
carry
away
any
sadness
and
depression
or
heaviness
that
you
may
be
feeling
.
(
uplifting
music
)
Continue
breathing
slowly
and
deeply
into
your
lower
belly
.
Allowing
your
focus
to
remain
on
the
rhythm
of
your
breathing
and
the
sensation
of
the
expansion
and
contraction
of
your
belly
.
And
if
you
get
distracted
that
's
okay
.
Just
return
your
attention
back
to
your
breath
.
Using
it
as
your
anchor
for
the
rest
of
our
time
together
,
your
inhales
nourish
and
lighten
you
,
and
they
steal
you
enough
to
see
through
the
cloudiness
and
your
exhales
gently
carry
the
heaviness
,
pain
and
negativity
away
which
opens
up
space
for
ease
and
gratitude
to
come
in
.
(
uplifting
music
)
Take
some
time
now
to
sit
with
a
lot
of
compassion
and
love
for
yourself
.
Depression
can
feel
overwhelming
and
takes
so
much
of
our
energy
,
but
here
and
now
,
from
this
more
still
grounded
space
,
you
can
give
yourself
all
of
the
compassion
you
deserve
and
all
of
the
love
too
.
See
if
you
can
allow
yourself
to
just
be
exactly
where
you
are
.
And
when
judgment
comes
up
,
breathe
into
it
with
love
and
compassion
.
And
let
it
gently
float
away
,
dissipating
as
it
does
.
And
see
if
you
can
let
yourself
become
aware
of
a
new
feeling
of
stillness
and
ease
of
self
love
and
of
hope
.
(
uplifting
music
)
Remember
in
those
times
when
the
heaviness
and
cloudiness
set
in
,
you
always
have
the
capacity
to
return
to
this
space
to
take
care
of
yourself
and
love
yourself
exactly
as
you
are
,
to
wrap
yourself
in
a
big
hug
.
There
is
hope
,
this
will
pass
and
you
are
not
alone
.
(
uplifting
music
)
Now
let
's
take
three
more
deep
breaths
together
.
Take
a
deep
inhale
in
,
holding
it
for
a
bit
and
exhaling
it
out
.
Again
,
an
even
deeper
breath
than
the
one
before
feeling
it
weave
in
and
out
of
your
muscles
and
yourselves
.
And
exhale
it
out
.
The
last
time
,
your
deepest
breath
yet
,
this
time
sending
that
oxygen
through
your
entire
body
and
when
it
reaches
the
top
of
your
head
and
you
're
ready
,
you
can
open
your
eyes
.

you
you
youHello
my
loves
welcome
to
a
guided
meditation
for
self
love
by
Lavendaire
I
’
m
happy
you
made
the
choice
to
meditate
today
and
give
back
to
yourself
.
Let
’
s
get
into
a
comfortable
seated
position
.
Close
your
eyes
.
Rest
your
hands
on
your
lap
and
face
your
palms
up
for
receiving
.
Take
three
deep
breaths
with
an
open
mouth
exhale
.
Breathe
deep
into
your
lungs
and
your
diaphragm
,
expand…
.
And
then
open
mouth
exhale
and
let
it
all
out
.
Repeat
two
more
times…
take
a
deep
breath
into
your
belly
,
and
open
mouth
exhale
,
and
let
it
all
out
.
Deep
breath
in….And
exhale
,
let
it
all
out
.
Take
this
moment
to
feel
your
body
and
focus
on
gratitude
.
What
are
you
grateful
for
,
right
now
?
Feel
the
energy
in
your
body
,
a
body
that
works
to
keep
you
alive
and
functioning
,
without
a
second
thought
.
A
body
that
supports
you
and
everything
you
want
to
do
in
life
.
Give
this
body
acknowledgement
and
love
,
for
all
the
miraculous
things
it
does
for
you
to
keep
you
here
,
breathing
.
Now
,
focus
on
your
breath
for
a
moment
.
Isn
’
t
it
a
wonder
that
your
body
knows
how
to
breathe
,
continuously
,
without
much
effort
or
awareness
?
But
once
you
shift
your
awareness
to
your
breath
,
you
become
in
control
of
the
flow
of
your
breath
?
Your
awareness
is
powerful
.
Wherever
your
attention
goes
,
energy
flows
.
Use
the
power
of
your
awareness
to
focus
on
your
body
,
feeling
your
presence
with
each
breath
.
Relax
your
eyebrows…
Relax
your
brain…
relax
your
shoulders
...
relax
your
heart…
Relax
your
entire
body
....
Feel
your
body
soften
and
relax
.
Know
that
you
are
safe
in
this
moment
.
Your
body
is
your
shell
and
your
home
for
this
lifetime
.
Take
good
care
of
it
.
Give
it
love
.
Consider
:
What
does
self
love
mean
to
you
?
Self
love
is…
accepting
yourself
,
quirks
and
flaws
included
.
Forgiving
yourself
,
knowing
it
’
s
okay
to
make
mistakes
.
Knowing
your
worth
,
standing
tall
and
not
feeling
small
or
inferior
to
others
.
Loving
yourself
and
your
journey
,
knowing
that
you
are
both
a
work
of
art
and
a
work
in
progress
at
the
same
time
.
And
all
of
it
is
OKAY
.
Cultivating
self
love
is
learning
to
practice
unconditional
love
for
yourself…
What
does
unconditional
love
mean
?
How
does
it
feel
to
love
yourself
,
unconditionally
?
No
conditions
..
Meaning
:
You
don
’
t
have
to
be
anything
other
than
yourself
.
You
don
’
t
have
to
prove
yourself
to
anyone
.
You
are
already
lovable
and
loved
.
You
don
’
t
have
to
try…
You
are
already
worthy
of
love
.
Feel
how
it
would
feel
to
love
yourself
,
unconditionally…
Now
we
’
ll
be
reciting
some
positive
affirmations
to
cultivate
more
self
love
.
Feel
free
to
repeat
after
me
,
in
your
mind
.
I
accept
myself
exactly
as
I
am
.
I
love
and
embrace
all
of
me
.
I
am
grateful
for
my
body
,
and
all
that
it
’
s
doing
to
support
me
.
All
of
me
is
beautiful
.
I
am
enough
.
I
am
worthy
.
I
am
a
light
in
this
world
.
My
light
is
unique
and
incomparable
to
others
.
I
respect
myself
and
give
myself
what
I
need
.
Setting
boundaries
is
an
act
of
self
love
.
I
release
all
that
is
holding
me
back
.
I
release
all
that
does
not
align
with
my
truest
self
.
I
am
authentic
to
who
I
am
and
aligned
with
what
I
want
.
I
choose
love
over
fear
.
Come
back
to
your
breath
.
Feel
the
energy
in
your
body…
notice
how
you
feel
now
,
nourishing
yourself
with
love
.
Remember
this
feeling
,
you
can
always
come
back
to
this
.
Now
,
we
will
use
the
power
of
visualization
.
Imagine
the
energy
of
love
,
surrounding
you
,
surrounding
your
entire
body
.
Feel
the
warmth
of
this
loving
energy
envelop
and
hug
your
entire
body
.
Love
is
all
around
you
.
Light
is
all
around
you
.
Breathe
in…
inviting
that
energy
of
love
&
light
into
you
,
through
the
crown
of
your
head
.
Visualize
that
energy
flow
through
you
,
down
your
entire
body
,
nourishing
yourself
with
unconditional
love
and
light
.
As
you
breathe
out
,
release
all
the
negativity
and
fear
that
has
held
you
back
from
pure
unconditional
love
for
yourself
.
Breathe
in
love…
energy
in
through
the
top
of
your
head
,
and
breathe
out
..
Let
that
beautiful
energy
flow
through
you
,
pushing
out
all
that
doesn
’
t
serve
you
anymore
.
Where
light
enters
,
darkness
can
not
stay
.
Continue
this
visualization
as
you
gently
breathe
in…
and
out…
breathing
in
love
,
and
breathing
out
fear…
Resetting
and
replenishing
your
energetic
body
with
love
and
light
.
Begin
to
come
back
to
your
breath
.
Check
in
with
your
body
,
and
your
energy
,
and
notice
how
you
are
feeling
.
You
have
given
yourself
so
much
love
today
.
Continue
this
practice
by
nourishing
yourself
with
love
and
acceptance
,
every
single
day
.
You
are
fully
deserving
of
love
,
no
matter
what
.
You
are
already
worthy
,
simply
by
existing
.
I
hope
you
take
this
energy
of
self
love
into
the
rest
of
your
day
.
The
more
love
you
have
for
yourself
,
the
more
love
you
will
put
out
into
the
world
.
And
thus
,
a
better
,
more
beautiful
world
we
will
create
together
.
Sending
you
love

light

Namaste.Let
's
begin
by
taking
a
moment
to
settle
your
body
into
a
comfortable
position
(
2
seconds
)
.
You
may
close
your
eyes
or
keep
them
slightly
open
with
a
soft
focus
looking
downward
a
few
feet
in
front
of
you
(
2
seconds
)
.
Allow
your
spine
to
lift
and
your
shoulders
to
soften
(
2
seconds
)
.
Today
we
will
practice
a
body
scan
(
2
seconds

a
full
breath
in
(
2
seconds
)
and
a
long
slow
breath
out
(
2
seconds
)
.
Bring
gentle
awareness
to
the
breathing
(
2
seconds
)
.
Notice
the
in
breath
(
2
seconds
)
and
out
breath
(
2
seconds

and
spaces
in
between
(
10
seconds
)
.
Bring
attention
to
the
top
of
your
head
,
notice
sensations
or
lack
of
sensations
(
2
seconds
)
.
Move
your
attention
down
to
the
back
of
your
head
,
the
sides
(
2
seconds
)
,
to
your
forehead
(
2
seconds
)
,
and
face
(
5
seconds
)
.
Move
your
attention
to
your
neck
(
2
seconds
)
,
and
your
throat
(
2
seconds
)
,
and
now
shoulders
.
Noticing
what
sensations
you
are
aware
of
.
Shift

to
your
arms
,

,
and
down
farther
to
your
lower
back
(
10
seconds
)
.The
body
is
always
breathing
,
and
the
breath
is
constantly
moving
.
Your
breath
is
not
only
the
best
place
to
start
;
it
’
s
a
constant
you
can
return
to
anytime
you
need
a
little
centering
.
In
this
practice
,
you
will
gently
find
the
breath
in
the
body
.
There
is
nothing
to
figure
out
,
there
are
no
problems
to
solve
,
and
there
’
s
nothing
special
you
need
to
do
.
Constantly
return
to
your
direct
experience
of
the
body
breathing
.
You
are
training
the
mind
to
be
with
one
experience
without
distraction
.
Find
a
comfortable
position
for
the
body
.
Sitting
is
often
recommended
,
as

stillness

Gently
allow
the
eyes
to
close
.
If

more
comfortable
with
the
eyes
open
,
try
softly
gazing
at
the
floor
or
ceiling
(
depending
on
your
position
)
.
Allow
the
eyes
to
relax
and
rest
on
one
spot
.
The
idea
is
to
minimize
distractions
in
your
practice
.
Bring
your
awareness
to
the
abdomen
.
Relaxing
the
muscles
there
,
see
if
you
can
feel
the
natural
rising
and
falling
.

we
will
start
this
meditation
with
your
eyes
open
gently
although
your
room
is
probably
dark
focus
your
gaze
softly
on
one
point
a
spot
on
the
floor

the
wall
or
perhaps
just
a
sense
of
color
in
the
darkness
[

narrow
your
focus
to
this
one
single
point
and
allow
everything
in
the
background
to
blur
or
fade
away
let
your
focus
rest
on
this
one
point
stay
with
this
narrow
focus
for
a
moment
then
as
if
this
one
point
could
get
even
smaller
begin
to
draw
your
focus
in
until
your
eyes
gradually
closed
and
you
allow
your
attention
to
turn
inward
[
Music

invite
your
thoughts
to
do
the
same
narrowing
inward
letting
the
momentum
of
the
day
gradually
slow
[
Music

be
patient
with
this
process
of
slowing
down
[
Music

when
your
eyes
fully
closed
and
your
attention
turns
inward
bring
your
awareness
to
your
breath
[
Music

begin
to
count
the
length
of
your
natural
breath
in
and
as
you
breathe
out
encourage
your
exhale
to
be
one
count
longer
than
your
inhale
allow
each
long
exhale
to
carry
away
with
it
any
physical
and
emotional
stress
or
tension
[
Music
]
by
exhaling
longer
than
you
inhale
your
breath
will
slow
and
your
body
will
calm
down
continue
lengthening
your
exhale
for
a
few
breaths
cycles
letting
go
of
the
counting
if
you
like
and
simply
sense
the
full
exhale
[

know
that
your
breath
is
an
anchor
or
a
reminder
for
you
to
come
back
to
the
present
moment
if
you
find
your
mind
wandering
or
find
you
are
distracted
by
sounds
come
back
to
your
breath
you
can
not
get
back
a
breath
from
your
past
nor
can
you
make
a
future
breath
come
any
sooner
than
the
present
moment
[
Music

in
this
gradual
process
of
slowing
down
you
may
still
have
thoughts
going
through
your
mind
simply
notice
them
and
let
them
move
on
as
you
come
back
to
your
breath
[
Music

as
you
focus
your
attention
on
your
breath
approach
this
meditation
with
the
intention
to
simplify
and
to
slow
down
allow
your
body
to
soften
and
your
breath
to
be
calm
if
it
feels
right
to
you
as
you
breathe
in
imagine
that
your
breath
has
a
bright
white
color
to
it
and
it
is
filling
you
up
[
Music

and
as
you
breathe
out
this
white
light
is
taking
with
it
any
physical
tension
or
feelings
of
worry
[

[

take
a
long
slow
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
[

move
this
breath
all
the
way
down
into
your
abdomen
filling
you
up
with
light
and
making
space
then
allow
your
body
to
surrender
to
the
weight
of
gravity
and
relax
as
you
exhale
[

breathe
out
anything
that
no
longer
serves
you
on
your
journey
to
simplify
[

each
full
breath
clears
out
the
clutter
and
relaxes
your
body
and
mind
even
deeper
inhale
the
bright
white
light
exhale
let
go
deeper
and
deeper
allow
my
voice
to
be
your
guide
into
relaxation
you
can
drift
off
to
sleep
when
your
body
is
ready
[

and
your
subconscious
mind
will
continue
listening
and
relaxing
even
further
like
your
breath
slowing
down
your
mind
to
can
slow
down
in
relationship
to
each
breath
as
your
breath
and
your
mind
slow
notice
the
space
between
each
breath
and
the
similar
space

pause
between
your
thoughts

invite
this
gap

sleep
is
inviting
you
to
let
go
and
surrender
to
your

allow
this
to
happen
if
you
wish
take
the
final
steps
into
a
deep
restful
slumber
your
body
knows
exactly
what
to
do
to
relax
and
allow
during
your
very
productive
deep
sleep
as
you
drift
off
into
serene
peaceful
rest
my
voice
will
gradually
disappear
and
you
will
be
deeply
asleep
[
Music
]
when
you
wake
hours
later
you
will
be
energized
rejuvinated
and
callNo
matter
how
much
you
try
to
think
positive
thoughts
and
be
optimistic
about
the
future
,
unpleasant
thoughts
will
still
arise
.
You
can
not
avoid
them
,
and
there
is
no
use
in
pretending
they
aren
’
t
present
.
Your
mindfulness
practice
can
help
you
approach
these
thoughts
with
curiosity
.
As
you
build
an
understanding
of
your
unpleasant
thinking
patterns
,
they
will
no
longer
hook
you
in
so
strongly
.
You
can
learn
to
allow
them
to
be
present
without
letting
them
consume
you
.
This
exercise
is
a
practice
in
letting
thoughts
go
so
that
you
are
better
able
to
do
it
when
negative
thoughts
arise
.
Close
the
eyes
and
tune
in
to
the
points
of
contact
in
the
body
.
Feel
yourself
grounded
and
stable
as
you
sit
.
Breathe
deeply
,
feeling
the
body
supported
by
the
chair
or
cushion
.
Pay
attention
to
the
experience
in
your
mind
.
Notice
any
thoughts
as
they
arise
,
and
try
to
identify
any
emotions
that
go
with
them.So
,
to
reduce
anxiety
,
start
by
taking
a
moment
to
relax
your
body
,
soften
any
unnecessary
tension
in
your
belly
and
shoulder
,
and
find
a
posture
that
feels
both
relaxed
and
alert
,
Rest
your
hands
in
an
easy
effortless
way
.
With
your
eyes
open
,
take
a
few
moments
to
scan
your
awareness
through
the
sensations
of
your
body
,
and
wherever
possible
,
soften
and
release
obvious
areas
of
physical
tension
.
Let
your
eyes
stay
open
and
focus
on
the
middle
of
the
room
wherever
you
are
.
And
then
see
how
you
can
let
your
awareness
travel
across
the
room
from
where
you
’
re
sitting
.
If
you
’
re
lying
down
,
you
can
let
your
attention
go
upwards
to
the
ceiling
.
And
then
notice
how
you
can
let
your
attention
come
back
to
the
center
of
the
room
.
And
see
if
you
can
bring
your
attention
closer
,
to
about
book-reading
distance
as
if
you
’
re
reading
a
book
in
your
hands
.
So
clearly
,
you
can
determine
where
your
attention
goes
.
And
now
you
can
let
your
eyes
close
and
just
let
your
attention
go
inward
.
And
gently
focus
on
the
sensations

extraordinary
sky
dotted
with
stars

stars
light-years
away

new
and

float
gently
out

your
position
around
so
that
you
can
look
around
as
you
float
higher

float
up
above
the
marble
walls

invisible
there
is
no
blame
here
no
regrets
just
or
at
being
able
to
see
life
from
a
whole
new
perspective
traveling
over
the
estuary
you
head
along
the
coastline
scaling
large
cliffs
flying
high
above
them
thin
wispy
clouds
almost
transparent
from
below
are
blown
in
from
the
sea
hugging
the
cliffs
as
you
move
higher
the
clouds
wrap
themselves
around
you
like
gossamer
threads
the
clouds
wispy
fragile
and
translucent
follow
in
your
trail
as
you
saw
ever
higher
rising
vertically
now
higher
and
higher
looking
up
towards
the
moon
silvery
gray
the
moon
is
for
you

at
its
beauty

the
ebb
and
wane
of
the
tides

is
suddenly

seems
less
complicated

is
a
sense
of
pureness
of
mystery
and
yet
clarity
life
is
good
life
is
wonderful
and
you
share
a
sense
of
connection
with
the
universe
breathing
deeply
and
then
release
the
breath
letting
go
of
any
tension
within
your
body
instead
focus
on
the
softness
of
every
muscle
feel
yourself
loose
relaxed
and
free
from
burden
far
below
you
low
flying
birds
hug
the
surface
of
the
water
disturbed
they
seem
tiny
and
fast
moving
the
water
ripples
gently
sparkling
stars
and
the
light
from
the
moon
Herald
your
way
you
see
the
world
from
an
enlightened
viewpoint
and
it
is
one
of
wonder
here
high
above
the
fragmented
clouds
you
feel
a
part
of
the
world
's
mystery
connected
on
every
level
and
free
from
your
problems
you
can
sense
a
change
around
you
gradually
the
air
becomes
warmer
and
misted
as
cloud
formations
begin
to
forge
together
the
sky
changes
color
dark
muted
through
to
light
and
for
a
while
the
Sun
and
Moon
share
a
place
in
the
heavens
he
dropped
down
now
through
the
fluffy
clouds
thicker
now
and
float
down
towards
the
Earth
's
surface
you
feel
exalted
as
the
see
now
mirrors
the
changing
skies
sparkling
sunlight
glinting
across
the
surface
and
shimmers
of
blue
you
drift
down
moving
on
away
from
the
water
's
edges
still
high
above
the
city
's
architecture
tall
concrete
pillars
and
homes
reaching
up
towards
the
sky
and
small
private
residences
alone
surrounded
by
small
patches
of
green
like
a
complex
jigsaw
of
life
stone
and
irregular
shapes
all
fitting
together
in
an
almost
seamless
ease
marvel
at
how
the
man-made
structures
can
look
beautiful
too
here
you
can
see
that
life
is
about
living
and
not
holding
on
to
problems
there
is
no
place
in
your
life
anymore
for
anxieties
that
make
you
feel
ill
tension
headaches
regrets
that
nor
away
that
cue
or
the
decisions
that
you
just
ca
n't
make
here
in
this
weightless
existence
you
realize
that
you
can
be
free
from
all
of
the
negative
aspects
of
life
no
longer
shackled
by
an
existence
that
holds
you
back
this
acknowledgement
is
meaningful
it
has
the
power
to
change
your
life
as
you
breathing
deeply
conjure
up
the
image
of
those
problems
and
all
of
the
boxes
that
you
left
behind
initially
they
were
overflowing
threatening
in
their
power
to
hamper
your
life
to
impact
you
at
every
turn
now
picture
them
reduced
in
size
no
more
threatening
just
minor
inconveniences
now
that
you
have
scaled
them
in
your
mind
shrink
the
problems
smaller
still
breathe
deeply
again
and
then
out
breathing
out
the
last
of
your
connections
to
those
problems
and
visualize
them
growing
ever
smaller
minut
a
fraction
of
their
former
size
and
you
realize
that
your
perspective
was
clouded
before
your
judgement
of
center
your
realization
of
the
truth
in
life
and
the
importance
of
nature
and
your
place
in
the
world
makes
those
problems
seem
insignificant
by
comparison

see
the
problems
of
life

the

welcome
to
a
guided
meditation
for
anxiety
and
depression
on
the
clutter
of
the
mind
so
let
's
start
the
practice
by
finding
our
seat
you
can
sit
on
a
chair
or
cushion
on
the
floor
[
Music
]
and
sit
with
your
back
upright
but
comfortable
so
before
getting
into
the
practice
let
's
just
start
by
acknowledging
how
we
feel
in
this
moment
and
we
do
n't
need
to
add
a
story
to
the
way
we
are
feeling
we
do
n't
need
to
judge
it
or
try
to
change
it
right
now
just
be
with
it
part
of
suffering
is
that
we
suffer
that
we
suffer
so
we
add
thoughts
or
stories
that
only
worsen
what
we
're
feeling
mindfulness
is
an
open
awareness
and
acceptance
of
what
we
're
experiencing
in
the
moment
whether
it
's
good
or
bad
so
let
's
start
here
with
acknowledgement
and
now
let
's
start
by
taking
in
a
few
big
deep
breaths
breathing
in
through
the
nose
and
out
through
the
mouth
and
now
close
your
eyes
let
's
place
our
attention
now
on
the
breath
start
by
noticing
each
inhale
and
exhale
the
sensations
around
each
breath
and
where
you
notice
the
most
maybe
you
notice
the
rising
sensations
in
the
chest
or
stomach
maybe
you
notice
the
falling
sensations
around
the
body
on
each
exhale
and
just
be
with
the
sensations
follow
the
rhythm
of
each
in
breath
and
out
breath
with
your
full
attention
and
as
we
do
this
thoughts
may
arise
feelings
may
surface
and
this
is
part
of
the
practice
if
you
are
experiencing
anxiety
and
a
bout
of
depression
right
now
there
will
likely
be
thoughts
and
feelings
that
attempt
to
pull
your
attention
away
and
when
this
happens
notice
it
instead
of
resisting
or
changing
it
see
if
you
can
actually
play
with
these
thoughts
and
feelings
here
see
if
you
can
become
welcoming
of
them
and
allow
them
to
come
and
go
before
returning
to
watching
the
breath
and
if
you
find
yourself
following
a
thought
or
feeling
with
more
thoughts
or
adding
a
story
to
them
gently
pull
your
attention
back
to
the
breath
watching
the
sensations
of
breathing
and
as
you
watch
the
breath
and
continue
to
notice
thoughts
see
if
you
can
use
the
out
breath
to
release
any
discomfort
to
release
any
unwelcome
thoughts
sending
them
out
with
the
exhale
so
for
the
just
that
moment
even
if
it's
very
brief
the
mind
is
empty
and
allow
any
feelings
that
come
up
to
be
acknowledged
and
sent
out
with
the
breath
as
well
so
that
even
for
a
brief
moment
you
are
emotionally
still
and
quiet
see
if
you
can
find
those
moments
where
just
for
a
brief
micro
second
you
are
without
any
anxiety
or
feelings
of
depression
and
when
you
get
a
glimpse
of
it
it
's
tempting
to
seek
it
but
we
're
not
fabricating
anything
here
or
seeking
it
just
allow
these
moments
to
come
to
you
through
mindfulness
through
watching
the
breath
and
resting
in
awareness
and
now
let
's
shift
our
attention
from
the
breath
into
the
physical
notice
the
contact
that
your
body
is
making
your
feet
on
the
floor
your
body
against
the
chair
your
hands
in
the
lap
and
notice
your
weight
on
the
chair
or
on
the
floor
as
well
and
just
be
with
the
physical
sensations
for
the
next
few
moments
and
now
in
the
final
few
moments
of
the
practice
just
let
go
allow
the
mind
to
do
what
it
wants
and
go
where
it
wants
and
now

your
eyes

self-care
is
a
gift
to
enjoy
you
must
first
help
yourself
and
love
yourself
before
you
can
help
or
love
anyone
else
when
you
feel
ready
close
your
eyes
and
bring
your
full
awareness
to
your
breath
begin
to
count
the
length
of
your
breath
in
then
as
you
breathe
out
encourage
your
exhale
to
be
one
count
longer
than
your
inhale
allow
each
exhale
to
carry
away
with
it
any
physical
and
emotional
stress
or
tension
by
exhaling
longer
than
you
inhale
your
breath
will
naturally
slow
and
your
body
will
calm
down
do
this
for
a
few
breaths
cycles
at
your
own
pace
allowing
each
slow
exhale
to
settle
you
into
relaxation
and
stillness
for
this
practice
now
as
you
breathe
in
imagine
that
your
breath
has
a
bright
white
color
to
it
and
it
is
filling
you
up
as
you
breathe
out
this
white
light
is
taking
with
it
any
physical
tension
or
feelings
of
stress
take
a
long
slow
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
and
now
move
your
breath
all
the
way
down
into
your
abdomen
filling
you
up
with
light
and
making
space
then
allow
your
body
to
just
surrender
as
you
exhale
breathing
out
anything
that
no
longer
serves
you
each
full
breath
clears
out
the
clutter
and
relaxes
your
body
and
mind
even
more
deeply
now
allow
your
breath
to
return
to
its
natural
rhythm
know
that
your
breath
is
an
anchor
or
a
reminder
to
be
in
the
present
moment
know
that
you
can
not
get
back
a
breath
from
your
past
nor
can
you
make
a
future
breath
come
any
sooner
than
the
present
moment
so
you
know
you
are
always
in
the
present
moment
when
you
are
attentive
to
your
breath
your
breath
is
a
reminder
to
slow
down
and
be
present
and
this
reminder
is
always
with
you
as
you
may
still
have
thoughts
going
through
your
mind
notice
them
from
afar
as
if
you
are
an
observer
notice
your
thoughts
and
you
might
acknowledge
them
by
saying
in
your
mind
thinking
by
acknowledging
the
act
of
thinking
you
can
let
it
go
when
your
mind
does
wander
simply
come
back
to
your
breath
and
use
this
breath
as
an
anchor
or
a
reminder
you
'll
keep
coming
back
any
time
your
mind
wanders
as
many
times
as
you
need

jacket
you
are
tethered
to
the
ground
and
you
spend
twice
the
energy
to
take
just
one
step
you
are
ready
now
to
shed
the
weight
of
this
jacket
as
you
can
sense
it
is
keeping
you
stuck
in
your
mind
imagine
yourself
taking
off
your
jacket
[

although
it
is
heavy
you
have
the
inner
strength
to
unzip
it
and
take
this
jacket
off
as
you
feel
this
substantial
weight
being
released
you
are
suddenly
so
light
that
you
feel
as
if
you
could
float
into
the
air
surrender
into
this
lightness
and
feel
the
freedom
observe
and
appreciate
this
lightness
for
a
moment

connect
with
this
light
and
free
feeling
of
ease
throughout
your

you
have
shed
a
layer
to
bring
you
closer
to
the
core
of
your
inner
peace

that
you
have
let
go
you
have
surrendered
into
the
weightlessness
of
ease
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
let
it
out
with
a
sigh
[

this
again
and
with
your
eyes
still
closed
slowly
invite
your
field
of
awareness
to
broaden
outward
once
more
[

notice
the
sounds
around
you
become
aware
of
the
surface
below
you
[

and
as
you
are
beginning
to
open
your
field
of
awareness
and
sense
your
surroundings
see
if
you
can
do
so
while
you
continue
to
stay
connected
with
your
inner
experience
and
the
lightness
you
have
created
when
you
are
ready
gradually
let
a
little
light
in
through
your
eyes
and
take
in
your
surroundings
continue
to
practice
shedding
the
heaviness
throughout
your

's
meditation
is
a
blissful
pause
that
can
be
a
cherished
break
taken
at
any
time
you
need
it
it
will
invite
you
to
rest
your
attention
on
the
present
moment
and
to
slow
down
from
the
fast-paced
and
sometimes
stressful
schedule
we
might
create
for
ourselves
while
it
might
not
be
realistic
to
alter
the
components
of
our
life
or
the
potential
stressors
we
can
take
time
to
pause
connect
with
the
present
moment
and
recharge
this
pause
is
a
sacred
strategy
that
will
help
you
to
meet
the
demands
of
your
life
with
more
ease
and
peace
I
will
guide
you
through
today
but
know
that
I
am
simply
helping
you
to
connect
with
yourself
in
this
present
moment
you
have
everything
you
need
inside
you
already
and
you
can
practice
this
in
the
future
any
time
you
would
like
take
this
time
to
come
home
to
yourself
settle
and
balance
your
equilibrium

carved
out
from

an
opportunity
to
slow
down
practice
inner
reflection
and
look
for
the
positive
growth
that
will
come
out
of
the
challenges
that
we
are
all
collectively
facing
while
it
feels
as
though

I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
close
your
eyes
if
you'd
like
or
simply
soften
your
gaze
invite
your
attention
to
shift
away
from
the
sights
smells
and
sounds
around
you
and
begin
to
bring
your
focus
inward
while
it
may
feel
like
you
want
to
escape
reality
when
things
get
difficult
now
is
your
invitation
to
make
a
deeper
connection
with
yourself
and
with
the
collective
energy
of
the
world
become
aware
of
where
your
body
makes
contact
with
the
surface
below
you
let
this
connection
ground
you
feel
this
as
support
and
allow
yourself
to
be
fully
supported
you
are
safe
you
can
trust
in
the
universe
use
this
sensation
of
where
you
and
your
support
meet
to
draw
your
awareness
gradually
from
your
outer
experience
to
your
inner
world
notice
without
judgment
what
your
physical
sensations
are
in
this
moment
your
body
has
the
amazing
ability
to
cope
with
challenges
and
grow
stronger
from
them
if
you
allow
and
let
go
of
resistance
it
is
okay
to
befriend
the
fear
that
shows
up
for
you
fear
is
not
the
enemy
it
is
a
helpful
and
necessary
emotion
when
it
is
channeled
correctly
meet
whatever
you
're
experiencing
with
love
allow
your
relaxed
awareness
now
to
move
to
the
sensations
of
your
hands
notice
your
hands
as
they
are
in
this
moment
what
sensations
are
they
are
now
do
you
sense
tingling
or
buzzing
are
you
aware
of
the
temperature
of
your
hands
now
make
tight
fists
with
both
hands
clenching
and
gripping
tightly
take
a
deep
breath
in
hold
it
for
a
moment
and
as
you
exhale
as
slowly
as
you
can
release
your
hands
completely
letting
go
letting
go
letting
go
do
this
again
make
a
tight
fist
with
both
hands
hold
it
tight
take
a
deep
breath
in
hold
for
a
moment
and
again
exhale
as
slowly
as
you
can
and
release
your
hands
release
the
gripping
letting
go
throughout
your
entire
body
feel
how
this
relaxation
moves
throughout
your
entire
body
as
you
let
go
of
the
gripping
in
your
hands
take
a
moment
to
enjoy
this
ease
connect
with
this
relaxed
state
while
there
are
many
things
in
life
that
you
do
n't
have
control
over
your
breath
is
one
aspect
that
you
can
direct
a
bit
to
continue
relaxing
and
letting
go
even
deeper
invite
your
exhales
to
lengthen
now
if
it
feels
right
to
you
start
to
count
the
length
of
your
next
inhale
and
encourage
your
exhale
to
be
twice
as
long
perhaps
you
begin
with
a
two
count
inhale
and
a
four
count
exhale
and
as
you
continue
lengthening
each
exhale
and
counting
your
breath
you
may
move
to
a
three
and
six
count
follow
the
lead
of
your
breath
breathing
in
this
way
for
a
few
more
cycles
allow
your
breath
to
be
easy
and
relaxing
continuing
to
let
go
of
gripping
and
let
go
of
the
need
to
try
too
hard
consider
the
times
in
life
when
releasing
and
letting
go
gives
way
to
growth
trees
must
let
go
of

in
the
fall
to
have

many

have
a

to
make
room

there
must
be
an
in

a
moment

through
your

can
you
find
any
areas
where
you
are
holding
on

into
those
areas
and
then
let

to

over

this
pause
right
when
things
seem
as
if
they
ca
n't
get
any
busier
ca
n't
get
any
more
chaotic
can
be
the
one
thing
that
reconnects
you
with
the
present
moment
reconnects
you
with
what
's
really
important
this
moment
to
pause

your
self-care
in
a
time
where
it
can
be
difficult
to
navigate
all
of
the
things

state
of
peace
you
can
think
more
clearly
be
open
to
possibilities
as
they
present
themselves
and
respond
to
situations
in
a
way
that
aligns
with
your
intentions
to
be
the
best
person
we
can
be
to
help
and
support
those
loved
ones
surrounding
us
we
first
need
to
love
and
care
for
ourselves
often
a
simple
moment
of
pause
and
mindful
attention
can
be
exactly
what
you
need
to
support
yourself
there
's
nothing
for
you
to
do
right
now
but
to
take
care
of
yourself
for
the
next
10
minutes
of
relaxation
as
we
begin
this
meditation
bring
your
attention
inward
to
your
breath
to
the
path
the
breath
takes
as
it
moves
in
through
your
nostrils
then
notice
where
it
flows
once
it
travels
inside
of
your
body
take
a
few
full
slow
deep
breaths
to
encourage
a
sensation
of
relaxation
to
inhabit
your
entire
body
this
mindful
pause
is
a
practice
and
can
be
repeated
often
throughout
each
day
when
needed
as
you
continue
your
attention
on
your
breath
begin
to
count
the
length
of
your
breath
in
then
as
you
breathe
out
invite
the
exhale
to
be
one
count
longer
than
the
inhale
allow
each
exhale
to
carry
away
with
it
any
physical
and
emotional
stress
intention
by
exhaling
longer
than
you
inhale
your
breath
will
slow
your
body
and
mind
will
calm
down
in
response
do
this
for
a
few
breaths
cycles
and
then
allow
the
breath
to
return
to
its
natural
rhythm
and
now
as
you
continue
to
breathe
naturally
notice
where
the
breath
flows
into
your
body
notice
how
it
makes
your
body
feel
and
what
sensations
arise
with
each
breath
there
's
no
need
to
control
your
breath
simply
use
the
awareness
of
your
breath
to
discover
what
is
really
occurring
what
you
are
feeling
and
to
bring
mindfulness
to
this
moment
of
pause
use
each
breath
to
continue
the
release
process
throughout
your
body
with
a
relaxed
awareness
take
a
moment
to
slowly
scan
your
entire
body
allow
your
awareness
to
move
over
each
part
of
your
body
noticing
any
areas
that
if
possible
can
be
softened
and
released
of
tension
begin
at
the
top
of
your
head
and
invite
all
of
the
muscles
and
your
-
relax
do
your
best
to
let
go
of
any
expectations
of
what
you
think
you
might
sense
and
simply
feel
what
is
there
without
judgement
as
you
continue
to
notice
the
sensations
around
your
head
face
throat
and
neck
try
to
connect
directly
to
what
you
are
feeling
rather
than
using
your
eyes
to
scan
the
body
the
eyes
can
create
tension
internally
try
to
sense
the
feelings
from
within
your
body
do
you
feel
tingling
heat
tightness
tension
or
relaxation
you
might
feel
a
sensation
of
floating
lightness
or
heaviness
you
may
sense
that
there
is
no
difference
between
where
you
end
and
where
the
energy
around
you
begins
it
is
all
connected
it
is
all
one
whatever
you
're
feeling
is
okay
simply
observe
the
sensations
as
they
are
and
invite
in
a
sense
of
ease
in
your
body
you
may
find
that
the
simple
act
of
paying
attention
to
a
specific
body
part
allows
it
to
relax
and
let
go
continue
moving
the
scan
of
your
body
downward
all
the
way
to
your
feet
and
stay
with
the
sensations
and
the
relaxation
process
as
you
slowly
scan
your
body
fully
notice
any
areas
that
might
still
be
holding
on
to
any
lingering
tension
and
ask
your
body
to
let
go
simply
let
go
of
the
need
to
be
in
control
and
surrender
to
the
support
of
the
surface
below
you
your
body
is
safe
and
supported
and
knows
what
to
do
to
relax
your
subconscious
mind
will
be
aware
of
anything
that
is
important
to
you
or
needs
your
immediate
attention
all
you
need
to
do
is
follow
the
sound
of
my
voice
as
a
guide
and
allow
yourself
to
relax
experience
and
embrace
the
feelings
of
unconditional
love
for
yourself
being
fully
present
to
this
moment
to
your
physical
body
to
the
sounds
around
you
and
the
surface
below
you
set
the
intention
for
peace
and
relaxation
for
your
physical
body
for
you
mentally
and
spiritually
your
mind
may
naturally
drift
off
into
thoughts
and
that
is
okay
you
do
not
need
to
completely
shut
off
your
mind
and
empty
it
of
all
thoughts
when
you
do
recognize
that
your
mind
is
drifting
acknowledge
your
thoughts
without
following
those
thoughts
into
a
drawn-out
story
you
can
choose
to
visualize
the
thoughts
drifting
off
into
the
distance
like
a
cloud
floating
by
and
then
come
back
to
your
breath
to
ground
you
and
bring
you
into
the
present
moment
once
more
the
breath
is
your
place
to
be
fully
present
the
breath
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
pause
if
your
attention
shifts
to
focus
on
a
sensation
or
emotion
allow
it
to
move
away
from
your
breath
for
a
moment
to
notice
what
's
coming
up
in
your
physical
body
again
without
judgment
and
without
getting
caught
up
in
thinking
stories
intend
to
allow
the
sensations
or
emotions
as
they
are
if
your
attention
begins
to
drift
simply
come
back
to
your
breath
as
your
anchor
to
ground
you
in
this
present
moment
and
now
begin
to
bring
your
awareness
back
to
this
present
moment
back
to
the
surface
below
you
and
when
you
are
ready
take
a
deep
breath
and
then
sigh
it
out
breathe
out
any
remaining
stress
frustration
tension
and
distraction
from
within
you
do
n't
be
afraid
to
make
a
sound
take
another
deep
breath
and
allow
your
exhale
to
flow
out
of
you
cleansing
and
healing
your
body
and
mind
like
a
warm
wave
of
energy
do
this
again
and
notice
how
you
become
increasingly
more
relaxed
yet
energized
and
focused
at
the
same
time
feel
yourself
becoming
present
anchored
and
grounded
in
the
simple
practice
of
breathing
deeply
and
when
you
are
ready
open
your
eyes
knowing
you
are
calm
and
focused
to
go
on
with
your
day
now
I
invite
you
to
find
comfort
choose
a
position
either
seated
or
lying
down
with
your
spine
straight
begin
by
closing
your
eyes
to
heighten
your
awareness
of
this
present
moment
through
the
senses
other
than
sight
explore
and
connect
with
the
space
around
you
using
your
senses
allow
yourself
to
settle
in
to
this
space
noticing
how
you
relate
to
the
room
around
you
notice
the
air
in
the
room
since
the
temperature
of
the
air
as
it
gently
contacts
your
skin
does
the
air
around
you
feel
humid
or
dry
is
there
a
distinct
smell
in
the
room
and
now
listen
for
any
sounds
within
this
room
perhaps
you
hear
the
word
of
a
fan
or
air
conditioning
unit
sounds
are
vibrations
and
can
sometimes
be
felt
within
your
body
look
inward
and
feel
the
sounds
and
growing
your
field
of
consciousness
now
to
look
for
any
distant
sounds
you
may
be
able
to
hear
without
straining
listen
to
the
sound
that
is
the
farthest
that
you
can
hear
letting
your
awareness
shift
inward
to
your
body
now
and
how
it
interacts
with
your
surroundings
notice
the
feel
of
the
fabric
of
your
clothes
on
your
body
since
the
constant
pull
of
gravity
anchoring
you
into
the
surface
beneath
you
now
allow
your
relaxed
awareness
to
rest
on
your
breath
without
manipulation
without
judgment
be
the
observer
of
your
natural
automatic
breath
be
here
now
as
an
observer
and
witness
as
your
body
is
being
breathed
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
no
good
or
bad
you
are
exactly
where
you
need
to
be
this
body
this
moment
this
breath
nothing
has
ever
happened
in
the
past
and
nothing
will
ever
happen
in
the
future
life
always
takes
place
in
this
present
moment
our
lives
are
a
series
of
present
moment
experiences
what
is
there
for
you
in
the
experience
of
this
moment
lean
into
this
moment
say
yes
to
this
moment
with
your
breath
allow
it
to
be
the
perfect
moment
that
it
is
slowly
allow
your
breath
to
deepen
inviting
your
spine
to
lengthen
as
you
inhale
without
effort
or
force
guide
your
breath
to
be
deep
in
both
location
and
volume
listen
to
the
sound
your
inhale
makes
inhale
with
an
intention
an
intention
to
fully
accept
this
moment
as
it
arrives
when
we
want
the
moment
to
be
different
than
it
is
we
create
an
internal
conflict
a
fight
with
reality
when
we
accept
the
moment
for
what
it
is
we
can
add
peace
and
ease
to
our
moments
knowing
wholeheartedly
they
are
as
they
should
be
we
are
on
our
journey
always
at
the
right
place
always
at
the
right
time
now
let
your
breath
soften
to
a
natural
rhythm
continuing
to
inhale
with
this
intention
of
presence
and
as
you
exhale
allow
yourself
to
let
go
let
go
of
areas
of
tension
in
your
body
perhaps
around
your
eyes
and
jaw
softening
your
neck
and
shoulders
let
go
of
negativity
from
the
past
let
go
of
the
worry
of
what
's
to
come
to
be
here
in
this
present
moment
give
yourself
permission
to
let
go
of
the
to-do
lists
the
shoulds
and
the
students
allow
yourself
to
rest
your
awareness
on
the
right
now
this
inhale
this
exhale
this
gift
of
breath
you
have
right
now
for
the
next
few
moments
of
silence
I
invite
you
to
continue
to
practice
being
with
your
breath
as
the
observer
watch
the
path
of
each
inhale
and
exhale
listen
and
feel
your
breath
fully
as
it
shows
up
for
you
right
now
observe
yourself
experiencing
this
present
moment
allow
your
breath
to
slowly
deepen
again
invite
your
awareness
back
to
the
surface
noticing
the
sounds
in
the
room
again
perhaps
since
any
difference
of
how
you
feel
now
from
when
you
began
this
meditation
and
when
you
are
ready
makes
some
very
small
movements
with
your
body
maybe
rubbing
your
thumb
and
finger
together
or
perhaps
wiggling
your
toes
and
begin
to
let
a
little
light
into
your
eyes
and
now
take
one
more
deep
breath
opening
your
eyes
and
smiling
in
gratitude
for
taking
this
time
for
yourself
thank
you
for
practicing
with
me
todayfirst
let
me
offer
my
sincere
congratulations
to
you
for
taking
this
important
first
step
in
your
meditation
practice
the
fact
that
you
are
hearing
this
recording
means
you
have
decided
to
make
time
for
yourself
to
turn
the
lens
of
your
vision
inward
when
we
are
more
often
looking
outward
frequently
not
knowing
the
right
way
to
meditate
or
the
possibility
of
not
doing
it
perfectly
may
be
discouraging
when
beginning
a
practice
in
reality
meditation
is
not
a
destination
it
is
a
journey
it
is
not
about
the
outcome
it
is
about
the
process
about
the
curiosity
you
bring
to
what
is
there
for
you
right
now
there
is
no
wrong
way
to
do
it
this
is
why
we
refer
to
it
as
a
meditation
practice
not
a
meditation
perfect
for
today's
practice
we
will
follow
three
stages
and
if
you
decide
to
continue
to
practice
on
your
own
you
can
follow
these
stages
or
come
back
to
this
recording
as
a
guide
as
frequently
as
you
like
you
can
follow
these
three
stages
for
five
minutes
or
an
hour
or
any
time
you
decide
simply
show
up
with
a
positive
and
open
mind
and
now
let
's
begin
I
invite
you
to
find
a
posture
that
allows
you
to
be
alert
and
awake
yet
still
unrelaxed
perhaps
close
your
eyes
or
soften
your
gaze
on
a
fixed
point
and
let
the
background
blur
[
Music
]
without
expectations
of
what
you
think
you
will
find
observe
your
breath
in
its
natural
state
without
changing
or
judging
the
first
stage
of
today
's
meditation
is
to
focus
on
one
thing
and
that
will
be
your
breath
[
Music
]
the
next
stage
is
to
focus
on
nothing
in
particular
with
the
intention
to
go
back
to
the
first
stage
of
focus
if
you
find
your
mind
wandering
and
the
third
stage
is
to
let
go
into
blissful
peace
and
simply
be
these
stages
do
not
need
to
be
linear
and
you
can
move
from
one
to
the
other
and
back
again
sometimes
practicing
will
be
comfortable
and
come
easily
and
other
times
it
may
be
difficult
and
uncomfortable
emotions
can
arise
your
meditation
practice
parallels
life
in
this
way
the
practice
is
about
the
journey
not
the
destination
begin
to
notice
any
sensations
you
experience
on
each
inhale
[
Music
]
maybe
you
feel
the
air
passed
through
your
nostrils
can
you
sense
the
path
your
breath
travels
once
inside
your
body
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
what
subtle
changes
do
you
experience
with
each
breath
in
notice
your
chest
and
back
rise
and
expand
with
each
inhale
do
you
feel
invigorated
with
each
inhale
and
now
what
do
you
notice
about
your
natural
exhale
do
you
sense
a
softening
as
your
breath
is
expelled
what
does
your
breath
sound
like
perhaps
you
feel
that
the
air
is
slightly
warmer
with
your
exhale
than
it
is
on
your
inhale
notice
your
chest
and
back
sink
and
soften
with
each
exhale
notice
your
own
natural
pattern
as
it
comes
and
goes
do
you
feel
a
subtle
relaxation
as
you
exhale
each
time
[
Music
]
and
now
for
the
next
few
breaths
since
the
natural
pause
between
each
part
of
your
breath
there
is
a
moment
after
you
inhale
and
before
you
begin
your
next
exhale
where
you
can
bring
your
attention
to
rest
[
Music
]
continuing
to
focus
on
your
breath
a
little
longer
begin
to
create
an
equal
part
breath
starting
to
count
the
length
of
your
inhale
and
match
the
length
with
your
exhale
you
may
find
that
as
you
practice
this
equal
part
breath
the
lengths
and
depth
of
your
breath
extends
whatever
you
notice
is
okay
perhaps
explore
what
it
would
be
like
to
start
your
inhale
from
low
in
your
belly
then
fill
up
your
ribs
and
chest
then
all
the
way
up
to
your
throat
and
then
exhale
fully
for
the
same
length
as
your
inhale
practice
this
equal
count
breath
for
several
more
cycles
until
your
focus
naturally
releases
the
counting
to
focus
on
nothing
in
particular
then
you
will
practice
being
in
quiet
stillness
if
your
mind
wanders
off
into
thought
or
story
or
you
notice
a
noise
or
distraction
simply
bring
your
attention
back
to
your
counting
and
the
equal
part
breath
until
you
are
ready
once
more
to
focus
on
nothing
specific
and
let
go
into
bliss
enjoy
this
practice
for
a
few
moments
longer
and
I
will
bring
your
attention
back
when
it
's
time
this
is
a
practice
it
is
natural
to
lose
focus
so
be
kind
to
yourself
and
keep
coming
back
continue
to
start
over
when
you
need
without
judging
it
is
time
now
to
begin
the
journey
to
looking
outward
once
more
take
your
time
deepen
your
breath
again
bring
some
gentle
movements
to
your
fingers
and
toes
and
welcome
in
refreshing
energy
throughout
your
body
as
your
field
of
consciousness
grows
out
from
your
Center
bring
some
light
and
color
into
your
eyes
from
your
surroundings
at
first
notice
this
space
where
part
of
you
is
still
looking
inward
as
another
part
of
you
is
beginning
to
look
outward
again
how
long
can
this
experience
last
throughout
your
day
are
you
able
to
metaphorically
continue
to
have
one
eye
looking
inward
as
the
other
is
looking
outward
thank
you
for
practicing
with
me

meditation

other
skill

of
relaxation

breath
will
be
your

you
rooted

when
you
focus
on
your
breath
you
are
always
focused
in
the
present
moment

can
not
get
back
a
past
breath
and
you
can
not
breathe
in
a
future
breath
before
the
present
moment
[

as
you
continue
to
stay
with
your
breath
as
an
anchor
to
the
present
moment
allow
it
to
flow
naturally
[

releasing

deepen
each
breath
in
and
out
[

as
your
breath
fills
you
up
more
fully
[

invite
your
attention
to
rest
on
the
space
that
comes
between
the
inhale
and
the
exhale
[
Music

and
as
you
focus
your
attention
on
this
stillness
allow
it
to
last
a
little
longer
pausing
holding
the
breath
momentarily
between
the
inhale
and
the
exhale
[
Music

breathe
in
this
way
for
three
more
cycles
of
breath
attending
to
the
stillness
the
pause
[

and
feel
as
the
tension
melts
away
from
your
body
[

give
yourself
permission
to
be
fully
supported
by
your
surroundings
and
be
open
to
the
possibilities
of
what
comes
with
this
state
of
comfort
[
Music

allow
your
mind
to
quiet
[
Music
]
and
the
noises
and
the
responsibilities
of
the
world
around
you
to
turn
off
[
Music

as
you
still
may
have
thoughts
going
through
your
mind
notice
them
from
afar
as
if
you
are
an
observer
[
Music

and
by
the
space
between
your
thoughts
to
extend
[
Music

just
as
you
did
with
the
space
between
your
breaths
[
Music
]
in
just
a
moment
you
are
going
to
continue
this
practice
of
awareness
as
you
bring
your
attention
to
your
physical
body
in
order
to
relax
each
part
of
your
body
beginning
at
the
top
of
your
head
moving
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
your
feet
I
will
guide
you
through
this
process
and
as
you
hear
each
part
of
your
body
being
spoken
you
will
first
bring
your
awareness
to
that
area
simply
noticing
how
it
feels
without
judgement
[
Music
]
and
then
you
will
relax
that
part
deeply
[
Music
]
and
now
turn
your
attention
to
the
top
of
your
head
first
visualize
and
feel
your
scalp
and
head
[
Music
]
and
then
welcome
in
relaxation
[
Music
]
as
you
begin
to
progressively
release
each
muscle
notice
how
powerful
your
awareness
is
[
Music
]
and
how
just
a
thought
in
your
mind
can
have
the
ability
to
relax
your
entire
body
so
deeply
[
Music
]
continuing
the
scan
of
your
body
feel
your
forehead
soften
and
smooth
since
your
eyebrows
and
your
eyes
[
Music
]
as
they
began
to
melt
noticing
the
tiny
muscles
around
your
eyes
release
perhaps
you
can
feel
that
your
eyelids
are
becoming
very
heavy
notice
your
cheeks
soften
allow
your
teeth
to
part
unclench
your
jaw
and
relax
your
tongue
feel
your
throat
softening
and
notice
as
your
neck
let
's
go
of
any
held
tension
invite
this
relaxation
to
move
into
your
shoulders
feel
the
warm
comfort
moving
downward
as
the
tension
melts
out
of
your
shoulders
moving
down
your
arms
and

has
always
been
within
you
and
all
it
takes
is
a
few
deep
breaths
and
a
moment
to
look
inward

welcome
this

about

noticing

can
still
remain
connected

while
being
engaged

closing
your

once
more

thank

I
wish
you
a
calm
and
easy
day
thank
you
for
joining
me
for
this
guided
meditation
to
help
you
relax
into
the
resistance
the
saying
goes
what
you
resist
persists
if
you
stop
and
think
about
how
this
applies
to
your
life
you
may
find
that
this
is
true
for
both
your
physical
experience
as
well
as
your
emotional
state
the
lesson
is
to
trust
the
experience
accept
what
is
with
respect
of
the
journey
and
simply
allow
letting
go
of
worry
expectations
and
the
need
to
be
in
complete
control
at
all
times
is
the
way
past
resistance
being
mindful
is
the
practice
of
noticing
and
allowing
the
experience
without
judgment
as
we
begin
to
settle
into
our
meditation
practice
they
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
sit
or
lie
down
in
a
way
that
allows
you
to
find
ease
in
a
position
where
you
feel
safe
to
be
supported
by
the
surface
below
you
so
you
can
completely
let
go
of
the
need
to
hold
yourself
up
or
to
control
your
posture
this
intentional
choice
is
sending
your
brain
a
message
that
you
are
ready
to
relax
into
the
flow
of
this
practice
and
the
flow
of
the
energy
of
life
begin
to
make
any
small
subtle
adjustments
to
your
body
to
welcome
the
relaxed
peaceful
state
to
wash
over
your
entire
physical
body
and
your
consciousness
as
you
are
beginning
to
surrender
into
the
calm
bring
your
attention
to
the
natural
rhythm
of
your
breath
your
body
and
your
brain
are
always
working
together
to
breathe
so
you
do
n't
have
to
constantly
be
thinking
about
it
however
the
simple
act
of
mindfully
attending
to
your
breath
deepening
your
breath
and
being
intentional
about
it
sends
a
message
that
it
is
okay
to
relax
now
is
the
time
for
inviting
ease
into
your
body
take
an
intentionally
slow
and
deep
breath
and
take
another
one
take
your
time
filling
up
as
much
as
you
can
and
slow
down
your
exhale
as
well
be
patient
with
your
breath
feel
as
your
next
breath
happens
to
you
easily
and
effortlessly
perhaps
deepening
and
slowing
down
your
natural
rhythm
and
now
simply
allow
your
breath
to
continue
on
its
own
relax
into
your
breath
let
it
be
as
your
breath
finds
an
easy
natural
flow
move
your
attention
to
your
physical
body
the
intention
as
you
scan
your
body
is
loving
compassionate
allowing
of
what
is
it
is
all
part
of
who
you
are
send
an
invitation
to
release
what
does
not
serve
you
slowly
bring
your
awareness
to
your
toes
since
this
area
without
judgments
or
expectations
what
do
you
notice
[
Music
]
what
would
it
be
like
to
relax
this
area
your
intention
to
bring
your
awareness
to
a
specific
part
of
your
body
gives
it
permission
to
relax
by
simply
noticing
you
can
find
ease
moving
your
attention
slowly
up
your
body
as
you
sense
the
soles
of
your
feet
you
are
ankles
your
calves
and
your
knees
if
there
is
any
area
of
your
body
that
is
speaking
to
you
keep
your
attention
there
a
little
longer
breathe
into
that
area
invite
a
release
allow
whatever
you
're
feeling
to
be
what
it
is
and
to
pass
through
you
rather
than
pushing
it
down
no
need
to
label
what
you
are
sensing
simply
experience
it
and
allow
it
to
release
and
relax
take
as
long
as
you
need
attending
to
each
part
of
your
body
perhaps
you
are
ready
to
move
your
attention
up
to
your
thighs
your
hips
your
abdomen
and
low
back
our
physical
body
holds
on
to
emotions
and
can
be
resistant
to
letting
go
by
attending
to
the
sensations
as
they
arise
breathing
into
what
you
experience
and
patiently
allowing
they
will
pass
through
you
then
you
will
bring
ease
and
comfort
into
your
body
what
would
it
feel
like
to
release
the
pain
and
discomfort
from
your
body
relax
into
the
resistance
now
move
your
attention
to
your
ribs

chest
and
your
heart

the
energy
of
your
heart
with
loving-kindness
and
compassion
for
yourself
and
others
this
is
a
safe
place
to
let
down
the
protective
wall
that
has
perhaps
been
surrounding
your
heart
what
would
it
be
like
to
open
your
heart
to
give
your
love
and
energy
freely
and
to
be
open
to
receive
it
back
if
this
brings
up
sensations
or
a
shift
in
emotions
come
back
to
the
intention
of
loving
compassionate
allowing
of
what
is
let
it
be
release
what
does
not
serve
you
moving
your
attention
to
your
shoulders
your
arms
your
hands
and
fingers
continue
to
relax
each
body
part
as
your
attention
washes
over
it
since
now
the
area
of
your
neck
and
throat
can
you
let
go
of
any
tightness
holding
or
guarding
can
you
find
more
space
for
the
energy
to
flow
freely
here
what
would
it
be
like
for
this
area
to
be
open
giving
and
receiving
of
energy
like
the
area
of
your
heart
sensing
the
release
of
your
jaw
cheeks
eyes
forehead
and
scalp
take
one
more
patient
scan
of
your
body
to
welcome
a
little
more
love
compassion
and
relaxation

any
areas

of
what

you
unique

the
fullest
resistance

your
energy
to
what

do
not
want

than
what
you

be
like
to
trust
the
situation
and
allow
as
you
continue
to
explore
see
deeply
into
the
situation
are
there
any
recurring
thoughts
images
beliefs
or
stories
associated
with
this
resistance
know

experience
with
love
and

for
yourself
and
others

become
aware
of
your
physical
sensations
notice
if
there
are
any
difficult
emotions
arising
that
are
making
it
more
difficult
to
be
[

present
you
might
notice
where
in
your
body
you
are
feeling
this
difficult
emotion
[
Music
]
and
if
it
feels
right
to
you
you
can
place
your
hand
on
that
area
[
Music

this
gesture
is
showing
you
that
you
cherish
yourself
do
your
best
to
let
go
of
the
story
around
your
emotions
[

let
go
of
any
expectations
you
might
have
and
simply
feel
the
sensations
within
your
body
[
Music
]
this
practice
is
not
about
what
you
are
experiencing
it
is
more
about
how
you
are
responding
to
those
sensations
[
Music
]
when
you
allow
yourself
to
feel
these
sensations
you
have
the
choice
to
respond
to
them
[
Music

in
a
positive
way
so
that
you
do
n't
allow
these
emotions
to
control
you
[

right
now
as
you
're
sitting
in
your
present
moment
experience
you
are
choosing
to
respond
to
your
emotions
with
compassion
and
loving
kindness
[

staying
in
the

moment
continuing
to
notice
and
accept
your
emotions
and
your
physical
experience
[

begin
to
inquire
within
and
ask
yourself
what
is
it
that
would
help
me
in
this
time
what
would
best
serve
my
experience
right
now
you
have
the
opportunity
to
let
go
of
the
story
to
feel
your
emotions
[
Music
]
and
to
meet
these
feelings
with
kindness
[
Music
]
you
might
offer
yourself
the
phrase
i
am
here
for
you
or
i
love
and
care
for
you
just
like
a
friend
or
a
loved
one
might
offer
support
to
you
[
Music
]
by
showing
yourself
this
love
and
support
you
can
create
a
safe
space
for
your
emotions
to
come
forward
[
Music
]
and
take
the
next
few
moments
of
silence
to
offer
yourself
love
and
nurturing
to
this
area
where
you
are
sensing
strong
emotions
if
that
feels
difficult
you
might
imagine
this
loving
nurturing
experience
coming
from
a
loved
one
[
Music
]
or
this
nurturing
might
come
from
some
other
form
of
energy
[
Music
]
so
[
Music

begin
to
deepen
your
breath
let
the
inflow
of
air
bring
more
love
more
nurturing
to
anywhere
in
your
body
that
might
still
need
it
[

know
that
with
each
breath
in
you
have
an
opportunity
to
pause
be
with
your
emotions
and
meet
those
emotions
with
love
and
compassion
and
now
begin
to
become
aware
of
your
surroundings
notice
any
sounds
around
you
[
Music

perhaps
you
begin
to
notice
your
fingers
and
toes
once
more
and
when
you
feel
ready
take
another
deep
breath
in
and
as
you
let
it
out
allow
your
eyes
to
softly
blink
open
[

and
know
that
you
can
take
this
pause

and
now
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
make
any
large
shifts
in
your
position
to
find
a
resting
place
of
ease
take
your
time
make
any
small
and
subtle
adjustments
to
your
body
to
fully
relax
perhaps
releasing
your
facial
expressions
from
around
your
eyes
and
your
mouth
allow
all
the
tiny
muscles
in
your
face
and
jaw
to
soften
and
let
go
settle
into
ease
allow
the
settling
to
flow
into
your
mind
as
well
you
it
takes
time
and
patience
to
quiet
the
busy
mind
just
like
stretching
a
muscle
requires
relaxation
to
let
the
muscle
lengthen
the
mind
requires
relaxation
to
slow
down
to
make
space
you
today
we
will
intentionally
attend
to
our
breath
to
bring
about
the
relaxation
response
to
help
let
go
of
stress
to
let
go
of
any
negativity
that
you
may
be
holding
on
to
to
let
go
of
the
need
for
perfection
and
control
and
to
let
go
of
anything
else
that
may
be
limiting
you
now
I
invite
you
to
breathe
in
deeply
through
your
nose
and
breathe
out
through
your
mouth
with
a
relaxed
jaw
making
a
sigh
noise
continue
breathing
deeply
for
a
few
cycles
while
observing
your
breath
as
soon
as
all
of
your
air
is
released
allow
your
next
breath
in
begin
to
notice
the
moment
when
your
exhale
flows
right
into
your
inhale
and
then
when
your
inhale
becomes
your
next
exhale
and
on
and
on
the
flow
goes
like
an
ocean
wave
coming
into
Shore
and
rolling
back
out
again
you
may
notice
that
your
breath
has
returned
to
its
natural
rhythm
we
're
not
controlled
the
breath
has
an
automated
tempo
and
depth
feel
the
sensation
of
being
breathed
receiving
the
breath
into
your
body
there
is
a
force
greater
than
us
working
to
send
breath
into
our
bodies
and
it
is
our
job
to
allow
it
to
invite
in
the
breath
we
can
only
control
our
breath
for
so
long
before
it
returns
to
automation
the
same
is
true
in
life
you
now
moving
your
attention
to
each
exhale
to
breathe
out
is
to
let
go
of
air
to
let
go
of
energy
to
surrender
to
the
natural
rhythm
of
breath
for
the
next
few
breaths
focus
on
each
exhale
has
a
time
to
let
go
perhaps
on
your
next
breath
in
make
fists
with
your
hands
and
squeeze
them
tightly
and
as
you
exhale
literally
let
go
of
the
tension
release
your
grip
let
go
of
anything
you
're
holding
on
to
as
you
breathe
out
and
feel
the
sensation
ripple
through
the
rest
of
your
body
and
with
each
subsequent
exhale
let
go
of
what
you
no
longer
need
it
may
be
pain
it
may
be
anger
it
may
be
heartbreak
or
it
maybe
control
whatever
it
is
for
you
simply
let
it
go
let
go
of
tension
let
go
of
any
heaviness
weighing
on
you
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
continue
to
attend
to
your
natural
breath
rhythm
mindfully
[
Music
]
observing
all
you
can
about
your
breath
our
breath
is
always
with
us
and
by
using
it
as
a
focal
point
we
become
present
we
can
not
get
back
to
a
past
breath
and
we
can
not
breathe
a
future
breath
the
only
breath
we
have
is
this
one
in
the
present
moment
by
using
breath
as
a
focal
point
as
part
of
our
meditation
practice
we
develop
the
conditioning
to
know
that
at
anytime
we
need
we
can
simply
shift
our
focus
to
our
breath
perhaps
during
a
stressful
interaction
with
a
loved
one
while
stuck
in
traffic
or
as
anxiety
builds
there
is
no
need
to
bring
out
the
meditation
cushion
in
order
to
practice
being
mindful
we
can
simply
and
mindfully
breathe
and
as
we
have
practiced
today
our
breath
has
the
ability
to
bring
about
the
familiar
state
of
relaxation
and
calm
[
Music
]
you
[
Music
]
with
practice
you
will
find
that
perhaps
this
conditioned
relaxation
becomes
your
reflexive
response
showing
up
naturally
and
quickly
[
Music
]
breathing
naturally
brings
oxygen
to
your
blood
into
your
brain
to
bring
about
the
feeling
of
safety
and
with
this
feeling
of
safety
comes
the
relaxation
response
just
like
an
intentional
smile
bring
the
sensations
of
happiness
mindful
breathing
bring
the
sensations
of
calm
to
the
mind
and
body
stress
and
relaxation
can
not
exist
together
much
like
the
way
light
cancels
out
darkness
inviting
relaxation
into
the
body
can
cancel
out
any
remaining
stress
or
tension
your
breath
will
bring
a
sensation
of
release
to
each
part
of
your
body
and
now
imagine
breathing
into
your
shoulders
and
neck
since
the
natural
movement
in
this
area
that
is
connected
to
your
breath
rhythm
like
an
ocean
wave
can
invite
the
sensation
to
move
down
from
your
shoulders
through
your
arms
and
hands
visualize
the
movement
of
your
breath
pulsing
through
each
arm
and
hand
to
relax
fully
and
by
your
breath
to
fill
your
chest
ribs
and
abdomen
making
space
for
energy
to
flow
freely
open
your
heart
with
a
sense
of
lightning
and
then
soften
your
belly
peel
from
the
inside
the
flowing
quality
of
your
breath
as
it
travels
the
length
of
your
body
see
the
breath
now
moving
down
into
your
hips
and
legs
relax
your
ankles
and
feet
with
each
wave
of
breath
and
since
the
breath
now
in
the
soles
of
the
feet
sense
the
breath
going
to
every
cell
in
your
body
healing
with
life
's
energy
stay
with
your
breath
and
the
sensations
that
come
along
with
it
for
the
next
few
moments
of
silence
begin
now
to
activate
the
muscles
in
your
face
and
around
your
eyes
with
an
intentional
joyful
smile
feel
the
smile
wash
over
your
face
and
notice
what
a
simple
smile
can
do
for
how
you
are
feeling
continue
to
smile
for
a
few
more
moments
feeling
the
sense
of
joy
building
inside
you
and
when
you
are
ready
begin
to
bring
some
gentle
movements
to
your
fingers
and
your
toes
moving
the
energy
through
your
limbs
and
when
you
are
ready
open
your
eyes
knowing
that
you
can
always
come
back
to
your
breath
mindfully
thank
you
so
much
for
listening
I
hope
you
have
a
beautiful
daytake
a
pause
from
the
events
of

intention
to
love

deeply
accept
your
experience
and
give
yourself
permission

if
the
idea
of
loving

feels
uncomfortable
you
can
imagine
the
love
of
a
family
member

offered
to
you
like
a
warm
embrace
as

to
settle

to
the
short
morning
meditation
for
allowing
abundance
we
also
have
a
longer
version
of
this
meditation
that
can
also
be
used
before
bed
for
more
powerful
effect
the
mindset
of
abundance
is
the
opposite
of
scarcity
abundance
is
the
overflowing
and
over
sufficient
quantity
of
that
which
you
desire
and
you
have
the
power
to
invite
it
into
your
life
you
have
the
choice
to
change
the
way
you
look
at
things
take
the
next
few
minutes
with
this
meditation
to
prepare
your
mindset
for
the
day
ahead
and
watch
as
abundance
flows
easily
into
your
life
as
we
begin
allow
your
eyes
to
close
gently
and
focus
your
attention
on
your
breath
by
simply
being
mindful
and
intentional
with
your
breath
your
body
sends
a
signal
to
your
brain
that
you
are
safe
and
can
relax
and
focus
on
what's
important
taken
five
deep
intentional
and
relaxing
breaths
invite
in
a
sense
of
comfort
and
relaxation
with
each
breath
in
breathe
into
the
heart
and
expand
the
capacity
of
this
space
with
each
breath
out
let
go
of
tension
let
go
of
distractions
let
go
of
the
need
to
control
your
thoughts
[
Music
]
allow
your
breath
to
return
to
its
natural
rhythm
and
flow
and
as
you
continue
to
relax
I
will
guide
you
on
a
journey
this
journey
will
take
you
on
a
path
to
release
any
negative
beliefs
or
ideas
that
could
be
holding
you
back
from
the
abundance
you
desire
then
you
will
bring
in
the
energy
of
abundance
into
the
space
you
create
for
it
when
you
let
go
of
fears
I
invite
you
now
to
open
your
imagination
and
step
into
a
field
of
beautiful
wildflowers
look
around
you
as
you
stand
on
a
path
that
leads
you
right
down
the
center
of
the
field
here
you
are
surrounded
on
both
sides
by
flowers
and
the
most
vivid
colors
use
your
senses
to
take
in
this
beautiful
and
peaceful
environment
around
you
see
the
clear
bright
sky
above
you
feel
that
the
temperature
of
the
air
is
perfect
for
you
and
the
Sun
shines
on
you
gently
warming
your
skin
the
faint
smell
of
the
flowers
is
just
right
for
your
liking
perhaps
you
hear
birds
chirping
in
a
distance
or
see
butterflies
flitting
around
as
you
look
around
you
can
see
many
beautiful
colors
in
all
directions
around
you
you
sense
that
you
are
safe
and
peaceful
in
this
place
in
your
imagination
you
begin
to
walk
along
this
path
down
the
center
of
the
field
moving
towards
some
rolling
hills
of
even
more
wildflowers
[
Music
]
as
you
walk
you
have
a
feeling
that
you
are
carrying
around
something
extra
something
weighing
you
down
making
you
feel
heavy
and
tired
you
reach
into
your
pockets
and
feel
that
surprisingly
there
are
some
smooth
stones
these
stones
that
you
are
carrying
around
weighing
you
down
represent
your
fears
and
your
feelings
of
not
enough
they
represent
anything
known
or
unknown
to
you
that
is
holding
you
back
each
stone
is
something
that
is
blocking
the
flow
of
abundance
to
you
slowly
take
one
stone
out
of
your
pocket
and
leave
it
on
the
path
behind
you
as
you
continue
walking
slowly
feel
a
space
open
up
inside
of
you
as
you
let
go
of
something
negative
in
your
life
there
's
no
need
to
label
what
you're
letting
go
of
simply
let
go
knowing
it
is
something
that
is
no
longer
supporting
your
goals
and
desires
for
abundance
continue
to
do
the
same
with
each
of
the
remaining
stones
in
your
pocket
one
at
a
time
take
your
time
and
feel
the
energetic
shift
feel
the
space
you
have
opened
up
for
flow
[
Music
]
now
that
you
have
let
go
of
that
which
no
longer
serves
you
and
you
have
made
room
for
the
flow
of
abundance
invite
it
in
letting
go
of
resistance
gives
way
to
an
attitude
of
allowing
allow
in
positive
energy
thoughts
and
beliefs
allow
ingratitude
love
and
abundance
feel
this
flow
of
positive
energy
within
you
and
it
is
magnetically
attracted
back
to
you
take
a
moment
and
sense
this
energy
and
positive
feeling
as
you
look
around
at
the
field
of
flowers
now
you
can
see
possibilities
and
abundance
everywhere
you
look
each
of
the
flowers
around
you
grew
from
a
seed
each
seed
had
everything
it
needed
within
to
become
the
flower
that
it
is
and
each
flower
has
the
seeds
to
become
many
more
flowers
and
on
and
on
the
cycle
goes
much
like
these
flowers
have
grown
from
seeds
you
to
have
everything
you
need
within

have
the
life
of

of
abundance

this
component
of

what
comes
back
to
me

action
towards
my
goals

every
day
I
let
go
of
negative
influences
and
energy
that
do
not
serve

that
abundance
is
unlimited
and

benefit
others

a

to

relax
this

great
for
putting
a
pause
on
a
stressful
experience
or
negative
emotions
and
simply
connecting
inward
and
now
let
's
begin
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
choosing
any
position
that
allows
you
to
feel
fully
supported
where
you
can
relax
and
let
go
[
Music

choose
a
position
that
you
know
you
are
safe
and
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
[
Music
]
focus
inward
[
Music
]
perhaps
close
your
eyes
if
you
like
[
Music
]
and
begin
to
settle
in
[
Music
]
make
any
small
subtle
adjustments
to
your
posture
patiently
think
deeper
into
comfort
take
your
time
there
's
no
rush
here
you
set
aside
this
time
where
no
one
needs
anything
from
you
or
no
responsibilities
for
the
next
little
while
[
Music
]
let
this
be
a
pleasure
for
you
to
enjoy
[
Music
]
and
as
you
settle
into
comfort
allow
your
attention
to
rest
at
the
sensations
of
your
hands
[
Music
]
notice
the
palms
of
your
hands
[
Music

and
since
the
tops
of
your
hands
[
Music

and
notice
all
the
way
to
the
very
tips
of
your
fingers
[
Music
]
and
since
both
hands
as
a
whole
[
Music

notice
if
there
's
a
temperature
around
the
area
of
your
hands
do
you
sense
energy
perhaps
buzzing
or
a
vibration
or
tingling
[
Music
]
whatever
you
are
feeling
it
's
just
right
[
Music
]
this
practice
is
simply
about
looking
for
what
's
there
recognizing
your
true
experience
in
this
present
moment
[
Music
]
can
you
sense
a
feeling
of
weight
at
the
area
of
your
hands
maybe
your
hands
feel
very
heavy
and
solid
into
the
surface
below
you
or
perhaps
I
feel
light
as
if
they
could
float
off
the
surface
below
you
and
drift
into
the
air
[
Music
]
notice
if
there
's
a
color
around
the
area
of
your
hands
that
can
be
sensed
[
Music
]
and
now
with
a
relaxed
awareness
welcome
your
attention
to
rest
on
your
feet
notice
the
tops
of
your
feet
and
ankles
[
Music
]
notice
your
toes
[
Music
]
and
the
soles
of
your
feet
[
Music
]
is
there
a
temperature
you
are
aware
of
at
the
area
of
your
feet
[
Music
]
is
it
warm
or
cool
[
Music
]
or
simply
neutral
are
you
able
to
sense
heavy
or
light
at
the
area
of
your
feet
[
Music
]
perhaps
you
notice
a
color
when
your
attention
rests
at
the
area
of
your
feet
[
Music
]
is
there
an
energetic
quality
at
the
area
of
your
feet
[
Music
]
allowing
your
attention
to
continue
to
stay
here
at
the
area
of
your
feet
[
Music
]
imagine
bringing
in
energy
from
the
earth
from
all
around
you
[
Music
]
imagine
bringing
in
this
energy
from
the
soles
of
your
feet
as
if
they
were
permeable
[
Music
]
the
energy
moves
in
from
the
soles
of
your
feet
and
it
intuitively
moves
to
wherever
your
body
needs
it
[
Music
]
your
body
and
this
energy
coming
in
from
the
outside
flow
as
if
dancing
together
[
Music
]
creating
a
beautiful
flow
of
energy
filling
you
up
[
Music
]
where
you
maybe
depleted
[
Music
]
moving
excess
energy
where
there
may
be
a
buildup
since
this
energy
swirling
around
you
flowing
throughout
your
entire
body
[
Music
]
letting
go
of
excess
energy
through
the
crown
of
your
head
and
drawing
in
energy
to
refill
you
from
the
soles
of
your
feet
[
Music
]
perhaps
you
can
sense
this
energy
[
Music
]
like
a
warm
embrace
from
a

with

of
energy
[

for
just
a
little
longer
allowing

to
connect
with

sensing
the
areas
of

building
up
at

a

need

is
already
within

knows
how
to

the

how

perceive
the
situation
around

loving
connection
with

welcome
and
thank
you
for
listening
to
this
guided
meditation
to
practice
using
a
positive
internal
dialogue
as
you
go
through
your
day
there
is
a
continuous
dialogue
that
occurs
inside
your
head
often
planning
for
the
future
or
remembering
events
of
the
past
frequently
this
includes
expectations
all
of
the
shoulds
and
the
judgments
we
have
of
ourselves
that
may
come
from
others
or
from
internally
sometimes
we
may
knowingly
or
unknowingly
repeat
negative
statements
in
our
head
have
negative
beliefs
or
engage
in
negative
self-talk
our
subconscious
mind
listens
to
all
of
the
internal
dialogue
that
goes
on
whether
positive
or
negative
these
thoughts
act
as
affirmations
and
the
more
we
listen
to
them
the
more
we
believe
them
the
chatter
in
our
minds
that
goes
on
each
and
every
day
is
energy
and
has
the
potential
to
play
a
strong
role
in
our
beliefs
as
well
as
the
energy
we
send
out
into
this
world
each
time
we
say
these
negative
things
or
they
are
told
to
us
we
begin
to
believe
them
we
send
out
negative
energy
and
that
negative
energy
comes
back
to
us
and
these
negative
thoughts
take
root
in
our
subconscious
they
can
affect
what
happens
in
our
lives
the
choices
we
make
and
the
way
we
interact
with
others
each
thought
has
a
ripple
effect
outward
on
our
life
much
like
a
stone
thrown
into
a
lake
making
small
waves
outward
knowing
this
gives
us
the
ability
to
choose
instead
to
effect
ourselves
in
a
positive
way
we
can
retrain
our
minds
by
using
positive
thoughts
and
sending
out
positive
energy
by
repeating
positive
affirmations
in
our
mind
and
out
loud
these
two
will
become
beliefs
today
we
will
first
begin
to
relax
our
body
in
our
mind
with
attention
to
our
breath
and
a
connection
to
our
senses
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
you
take
a
moment
to
settle
in
you
have
chosen
to
take
this
time
to
honor
yourself
in
a
positive
way
by
bringing
mindfulness
to
the
way
you
live
you
are
strengthening
the
connection
between
your
body
and
your
mind
if
you
like
allow
your
eyes
to
close
gently
down
and
take
a
moment
to
bring
your
awareness
to
your
breath
without
changing
or
forcing
your
breath
notice
its
natural
pace
its
natural
depth
and
the
path
it
takes
inside
of
your
body
listen
to
the
sound
your
breath
makes
on
the
inside
hear
the
sound
building
as
you
inhale
and
softening
as
you
let
it
go
hear
the
rhythm
of
your
breath
as
it
relates
to
your
heartbeat
are
they
aligned
whatever
you
hear
is
as
it
should
be
simply
listen
and
now
attend
to
your
sense
of
smell
as
you
breathe
smell
the
air
as
it
comes
into
your
nostrils
what
do
you
sense
without
attaching
a
label
to
the
sense
simply
experience
what
is
around
you
feel
your
breath
now
feel
the
movement
of
your
breath
feel
the
expansion
in
your
lungs
feel
the
rise
and
fall
of
your
body
perhaps
since
the
way
your
clothes
contact
your
skin
or
how
the
surface
below
you
feels
as
it
connects
with
your
body
since
the
change
as
your
ribs
expand
and
since
the
pressure
building
and
releasing
between
the
front
and
back
of
your
body
maybe
you
can
see
your
breath
from
within
visualize
its
path
notice
where
each
breath
travels
within
are
there
any
areas
your
breath
avoids
or
spends
extra
time
in
and
since
the
relaxation
and
cleansing
effect
your
breath
has
on
your
body
and
mind
your
breath
has
the
power
to
bring
you
into
peace
begin
now
to
feel
the
temperature
of
your
breath
as
it
flows
into
your
body
is
it
warm
is
it
cool
does
it
have
the
same
temperature
on
the
out-breath
this
awareness
practice
is
about
bringing
focus
to
your
senses
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
way
to
do
it
no
correct
answers
there
is
simply
awareness
and
curiosity
and
what
arises
for
you
spend
the
next
few
moments
being
mindful
of
your
senses
and
your
breath
as
you
continue
to
attend
to
your
breath
and
your
senses
begin
to
explore
your
emotions
as
they
arise
with
a
curious
and
kind
approach
today
I
invite
you
to
explore
your
habitual
negative
self-talk
or
beliefs
without
judgment
perhaps
consider
how
these
things
that
you
may
say
to
yourself
or
believe
about
yourself
might
be
limiting
you
from
reaching
your
full
potential
and
fulfilling
your
passions
know
that
we
are
all
human
and
we
are
perfectly
imperfect
without
mistakes
or
failures
or
imperfections
we
would
not
grow
we
would
not
improve
we
would
not
learn
new
ways
of
doing
things
without
darkness
we
would
not
know
the
beauty
of
light
without
sadness
we
would
not
know
joy
without
pain
we
would
not
know
pleasure
know
that
these
feelings
coming
up
are
simply
energy
moving
through
your
body
and
out
into
the
world
and
while
you
can
not
stop
these
emotions
you
can
stop
them
from
taking
over
and
dictating
how
you
respond
to
your
life
's
events
you
have
the
ability
to
respond
in
a
positive
and
loving
way
the
positive
and
loving
energy
you
have
in
you
when
you
interact
with
others
can
affect
each
event
in
life
place
your
hand
on
your
heart
if
you
like
and
tell
yourself
that
you
love
yourself
sit
with
this
feeling
without
judgment
or
expectations
give
love
to
yourself
as
you
do
for
others
know
that
you
can
pause
for
a
moment
out
of
your
busy
day
at
any
time
to
say
these
words
and
reconnect
to
your
heart
practice
repeating
the
following
loving
phrases
in
your
mind
or
use
your
own
positive
phrases
if
you
choose
believe
in
these
phrases
in
this
present
moment
feel
the
truth
of
these
statements
in
your
body
in
your
heart
and
in
your
mind
I
am
enough
I
love
you
I
am
listening
to
what
you
need
I
am
lovable
just
the
way
I
am
I
am
free
beautiful
and
wise
I
am
perfectly
imperfect
sit
with
these
positive
statements
for
a
few
more
moments
of
silence
and
feel
the
love
building
inside
of
you
and
now
welcome
a
deep
breath
into
your
body
know
that
you
can
come
back
to
your
mindful
attention
often
throughout
your
daily
life
you
can
meet
your
feelings
where
they
are
with
kindness
and
compassion
and
you
can
continue
to
practice
building
a
positive
internal
dialogue
now
bring
your
awareness
back
to
your
physical
body
to
the
sensations
inside
you
in
this
present
moment
continue
to
invite
in
a
building
sense
of
love
an
honoring
of
your
beautiful
heart
take
in
one
more
deep
breath
sending
it
into
the
area
of
your
heart
to
make
space
for
unconditional
love
and
when
you
already
open
your
eyes
thank
you
so
much
for
listening
todayour
current
culture
is
fast-paced
and
frequently
very
demanding
not
allowing
for
very
much
downtime
to
recover
it
's
not
surprising
that
many
of
us
have
experienced
stress
overwhelm
and
anxiety
at
some
point
in
our
lives
these
feelings
are
often
caused
by
the
racing
and
overactive
thoughts
of
our
mind
meditation
is
a
wonderful
tool
to
help
quiet
the
busy
mind
in
the
moment
and
also
to
practice
being
able
to
balance
and
Center
our
emotions
for
future
situations
you
have
already
taken
the
most
difficult
step
to
helping
yourself
you
have
chosen
to
take
time
to
practice
this
guided
meditation
let
's
begin
find
a
posture
of
comfort
sit
or
lie
down
so
you
can
experience
ease
in
your
body
which
will
allow
for
ease
in
your
mind
we
will
start
this
meditation
with
your
eyes
open
gently
focus
your
line
of
vision
on
one
point
in
front
of
you
you
can
find
a
spot
on
the
floor
or
the
wall
and
now
narrow
your
focus
to
this
one
single
point
and
allow
everything
in
the
background
to
blur
or
fade
away
see
all
that
you
can
see
about
this
one
single
point
now
slowly
broaden
your
field
of
view
like
a
camera
lens
widening
with
a
relaxed
awareness
notice
everything
you
can
see
in
your
current
much
broader
line
of
you
without
having
to
turn
your
head
what
colors
textures
and
materials
do
you
see
do
you
see
brightness
or
dim
light
around
you
[
Music
]
take
it
all
in
once
more
slowly
narrow
your
field
of
view
to
the
same
single
point
as
your
focus
narrows
continue
to
draw
it
in
until
your
eyes
gradually
closed
and
you
invite
your
attention
to
turn
inward
and
now
start
to
notice
the
natural
rhythm
and
depth
of
your
breath
without
making
any
changes
just
notice
listen
to
the
sound
of
your
breath
look
for
any
movement
of
your
body
that
is
connected
to
your
breath
[
Music
]
and
now
intentionally
begin
to
deepen
each
breath
in
and
slow
down
on
your
exhale
as
you
slow
down
and
deepen
your
breath
take
time
to
notice
all
there
is
to
experience
about
your
breath
[
Music
]
and
explore
how
your
breath
might
change
slightly
as
you
continue
to
look
inward
[
Music
]
simply
notice
the
experience
of
your
breath
without
expectations
and
without
judgments
what
would
it
be
like
to
offer
your
breath
some
love
and
compassion
like
your
breath
slowing
down
your
mind
to
can
slow
down
in
relationship
to
each
breath
as
your
breath
and
your
mind
slow
notice
the
space
between
each
breath
and
the
similar
space
or
pause
between
your
thoughts
invite
this
gap
between
breaths
and
thoughts
to
lengthen
be
in
the
gap
no
need
to
do
anything
simply
be
in
this
space
without
expectations
what
do
you
notice
in
stillness
[
Music
]
this
is
a
judgment-free
practice
of
allowing
what
is
there
to
come
to
the
surface
with
curiosity
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
if
you
find
your
mind
wandering
or
your
sense
of
calm
begin
to
dissipate
come
back
to
your
breath
and
the
gap
between
thoughts
[
Music
]
when
we
slow
down
we
notice
more
when
we
are
in
the
gap
we
notice
what
we
might
otherwise
be
missing
when
we
rush
or
overthink
experience
your
body
being
breathed
and
let
your
attention
rest
on
the
space
between
breath
and
thought
[
Music
]
now
broaden
your
awareness
to
the
physical
experience
of
your
body
look
inside
and
since
the
energy
and
feelings
of
one
single
point
at
the
area
of
your
stomach
what
do
you
notice
at
this
one
small
focal
point
[
Music
]
similar
to
broadening
your
visual
focal
point
begin
to
widen
the
experience
of
your
sensations
moving
outward
from
your
stomach
notice
where
your
body
makes
a
connection
with
the
surface
below
you
perhaps
you
sense
there
is
a
blurring
of
the
lines
that
separate
you
from
the
support
and
from
the
energy
around
you
or
maybe
you
feel
pressure
or
warmth
at
this
connection
continue
gradually
moving
this
relaxed
scan
of
your
body
helped
from
your
Center
notice
if
there
are
any
parts
that
are
making
contact
with
another
part
of
your
body
[
Music

awaken
to
the
sensations
in
your
body
moving
out
from
your
Center
now
since
the
aliveness
in
your
hands
and
in
your
feet

feel
the
energy
moving
within
you

inhabit
your
body
fully
when
we
can
do
this
live
in
this
body
sense
our
own
aliveness
we
are
in
the
present
and
living
in
the
space
between
our
thoughts
when
your
mind
is
attentive
to
the
sensations
of
your
body
you
can
pause
you
can
extend
the
gap
between
your
thoughts
this
gap
is
where
you
can
experience
peace
and
calm
notice
now
if
there
is
anywhere
you
can
soften
a
little
bit
more
look
for
any
where
you
can
let
go
even
deeper
into
relaxation
and
ease
let
your
physical
body
go
so
that
you
can
let
your
thoughts
go
[
Music

imagine
your
thoughts
are
like
a
river
flowing
gently
downstream
let
your
thoughts
go
so
you
can
be
here
now
awake
to
the
sensations
in
your
body
[
Music

what
would
it
be
like
to
relax
a
tense
muscle
right
now
what
would
it
feel
like
to
let
go
of
tension
and
tightness
look
inside
for
any
areas
of
your
body
that
are
telling
you
something
sometimes
the
simple
act
of
attending
to
a
sensation
allows
it
to
soften
or
fade
away
our
body
wants
to
be
heard
to
be
recognized

invite
your
attention
to
move
to
the
areas
of
your

that
are
telling
you
something
and
feel
the
sensations
there
quiet
your
thoughts
to
hear
the
sensations

take
another
full
breath
in

it
out
as

as
you
can
and
do
this
again
letting
go
of
your
breath
letting
go
of
tension
letting
go
of
your
busy
mind
as

brought
in
your

once
more
look
for
habits
or
recurring
tendencies
that
you
may
have
to
leave
your
body
and
come
back
as
many
times
as
you
need
start
over
with
you're
aware
presence
in
life
outside
of
meditation
look
for
patterns
when
you
might
be
rushing
and
come
back
to
experience
life
fully
when
we
slow
down
and
stay
with
the
sensations
as
long
as
we
can
we
notice
more
we
live
more
fully
when
we
are
trying
to
control
our
life
to
make
it
just
the
way
we
want
it
to
be
perfect
we
are
not
experiencing
all
that
life
has
to
offer
listen
to
what
wants
to
be
heard
see
what
wants
to
be
seen
to
do
this
slow
down
cause
in
the
gap
between
thoughts
quiet
our
thoughts
to
see
hear
and
feel
deeply
and
have
it
your
body
fully
and
be
open
to
life
when
you
were
already
open
your
eyes
I
hope
you
have
a
peaceful
and
calm
day
thank
you
for
practicing
with
methank
you
for
tuning
in
to
this
guided
meditation
and
visualization
practice
to
balance
your
chakras
when
practice
regularly
balancing
your
chakras
can
be
a
powerful
tool
to
affect
change
in
the
ways
you
desire
and
all
aspects
of
your
life
this
visualization
will
guide
you
into
a
relaxed
state
bring
your
attention
to
each
chakra
and
help
restore
the
balance
energetic
flow
through
the
chakra
system
as
a
whole
within
the
center
of
your
body
along
the
length
of
your
spine
and
head
resides
seven
bundles
of
nerves
or
Wheels
of
energy
called
chakras
each
of
these
seven
chakras
are
part
of
a
system
that
functions
as
a
whole
each
one
needs
to
work
independently
as
well
as
flow
with
the
others
in
the
system
we
know
that
together
the
chakras
have
a
connection
with
each
other
and
interact
energetically
therefore
today
as
we
balance
the
chakras
we
will
not
only
consider
each
chakra
but
all
of
the
centers
together
and
the
energy
that
moves
through
the
whole
system
as
we
begin
this
practice
make
yourself
comfortable
with
your
spine
straight
either
sitting
or
lying
down
if
it
is
safe
and
enjoyable
for
you
perhaps
being
outside
and
utilizing
the
energy
of
nature
which
is
a
powerful
way
to
practice
this
visualization
allow
your
eyes
to
close
down
gently
invite
your
attention
to
rest
on
your
breath
breathe
naturally
through
your
nose
and
notice
the
sensations
arising
in
your
body
created
by
the
air
as
it
moves
in
and
out
of
your
body
notice
any
subtle
movements
in
your
body
since
the
temperature
of
the
air
as
it
passes
through
your
nostrils
peel
your
chest
and
back
rise
and
fall
naturally
with
each
breath
[
Music
]
since
if
there
is
a
connection
between
your
breath
rhythm
and
that
of
your
heartbeat
this
awareness
practice
is
about
feeling
the
sensations
of
your
body
from
within
as
they
arise
naturally
rather
than
trying
to
control
or
change
your
breath
[

moment
of
silence

comfortable
state
of
relaxation

that
you
are
standing
at
the
top
of
a
beautiful
white
marble
staircase
see
the
staircase
in
vivid
detail
you
rest
your
hand
on
the
smooth
cool
marble
banister
that
runs
down
beside
the
staircase

look
down
the
stairs
you
notice
that
there
are
ten
steps
leading
down
these
are
steps
that
will
lead
you
deeper
into
relaxation
in
a
moment
as
I
begin

count
you
will
walk
down
these
steps
you
will
find
that
the
deeper
down
you
go
the
more
comfortable
and
the
more
relaxed
you
will
become
so

you
can
hold
on
to
the
beautiful
banister
and
begin
to
slowly
descend
the
stairs
as
I
count
10
you
are
deeply
relaxed

feel
the
stress
melting
away

you
feel
yourself
completely
letting
go
of
any
responsibilities

things
you
may
need
to
do
eight
you
know
you
are
right
where
you
need
to
be
on
your
journey

you
allow
the
outside
world
to
turn
off
seven
this
step
takes
you
even
deeper
into
a
relaxed
state
six
you
are
committed
to
taking
your
life
and
dreams
to
the
next
level
five
as
you
descend
you
feel
the
familiar
state
of
freedom
in
your
body
and
clarity
in
your
mind
that
comes
with
this
relaxation
for
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
comfort
three
almost
to
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
almost
to
the
light
two
deep
deep
into
relaxation
and
one
all
the
way
into
a
deep
state
of
relaxation
and
now
that
you
have
reached
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
you
are
completely
relaxed
and
comfortable
they
take
a
moment
to
look
at
your
surroundings
you
realize
that
the
light
you
see
is
shining
out
from
behind
a
partially
closed
door
at
the
bottom
of
a
staircase
it
is
seeping
out
from
the
edges
of
the
door
expanding
its
light
outward
you
have
a
sense
that
behind
this
door
is
all
that
you
are
capable
of
and
all
of
your
inner
potential
this
light
is
shining
out
only
a
little
bit
allowing
only
some
of
your
potential
to
be
seen
you
know
that
before
this
door
can
be
opened
all
the
way
there
are
things
that
you
must
let
go
of
and
now
take
a
moment
and
first
let
go
of
any
negativity
you
may
be
holding
on
to
this
negativity
does
n't
have
to
be
named
specifically
just
let
it
go
but
the
energy
of
negativity
go
what
you
put
out
into
the
world
will
come
back
to
you
put
out
positivity
send
out
love
and
light
radiate
this
energy
outward
to
the
world
and
it
will
come
back
to
you
give
what
you
wish
to
receive
and
let
go
of
limiting
beliefs
of
yourself
see
these
beliefs
floating
away
from
your
body
like
a
feather
in
the
wind
and
replace
the
old
limiting
beliefs
with
new
positive
beliefs
these
limitations
we
put
on
ourselves
could
be
holding
us
back
from
moving
forwards
towards
our
ideal
life
and
towards
contentment
let
it
all
go
let
go
of
any
expectations
you
have
of
yourself
and
in
any
expectations
you
believe
others
have
for
you
let
go
of
the
need
to
please
anyone
but
you
and
take
care
what
others
think
let
go
of
attachments
let
it
all
go
let
go
of
competition
with
yourself
and
with
others
let
go
of
the
idea
of
being
perfect
and
the
need
to
always
be
right
let
go
of
the
shoulds
in
your
life
and
replace
these
thoughts
with
the
idea
that
you
are
enough
being
enough
means
being
comfortable
with
your
body
as
it
is
today
being
comfortable
with
what
you
have
achieved
as
well
as
what
you
have
not
being
enough
means
self-acceptance
and
it
is
something
we
could
all
say
to
ourselves
more
often
let
it
all
go
let
go
of
excuses
let
go
of
judgmental
thoughts
let
go
of
jealousy
and
thoughts
of
not
enough
let
go
of
insecurities
let
it
all
go
let
go
of
the
past
in
order
to
move
forward
let
go
of
worries
for
the
future
let
go
of
fear
forgive
allow
the
past
to
be
the
past
and
not
create
your
destiny
be
here
now
be
present
be
mindful
be
grateful
be
joyful
and
be
loved
and
let
go
of
anything
else
that
is
no
longer
serving
you
and
now
that
you
have
let
go
of
all
negativity
and
replaced
it
with
positive
love
and
light
now
you
know
it
is
time
to
open
this
door
all
the
way
to
let
the
light
shine
out
all
the
way
so
you
can
live
to
your
fullest
potential
so
now
reach
forward
to
open
the
door
and
as
you
place
your
hand
on
the
doorknob
and
pull
all
of
your
inner
strength
determination
and
possibilities
flow
out
filling
up
your
mind
and
the
space
around

feel
the
strength
and
positivity
flow
out
from
your
mind

fill
your
entire
body
and
into
your
heart

completely
full
with
potential
and
possibilities

are
confident
and
capable

the
space
to
fill
up
with
your
full
potential
you
know
you
are
able
to
achieve
great
things
now
that
your
inner
strength
and
potential
have
been
released
from
behind
this
door
and
now
walk
into
this
light
feel
the
energy
and
strength
of
your
full
potential
surrounding
you
filling
you
up
this
energy
builds
your
confidence
and
motivation
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
you
find
a
bench
to
sit
down
on
and
you
take
this
new
energy
confidence
and
motivation
and
allow
your
mind
to
wander
and
be
imaginative
to
be
open
to
possibilities
and
now
I
'd
like
you
to
imagine
yourself
as
a
small
puzzle
piece
fitting
nicely
into
the
full
puzzle
that
is
your
life
each
person
in
your
life
is
a
puzzle
piece
surrounding
you
and
each
fitting
perfectly
together
each
facet
of
your
job
your
family
your
friends
is
also
part
of
this
puzzle
when
you
change
the
pieces
surrounding
you
the
closest
on
the
puzzle
must
change
as
well
to
stay
connected
all
these
changes
take
time
and
require
patience
and
some
pieces
may
not
fit
as
well
next
to
your
puzzle
piece
and
may
need
to
be
switched
with
another
piece
that
does
fit
you
have
the
ability
in
awareness
to
help
this
process
filter
out
the
pieces
that
no
longer
fit
as
well
as
have
the
patience
for
those
pieces
that
take
time
to
change
you
are
open
to
change
and
the
opportunities
that
come
with
these
changes
you
choose
to
soften
into
these
possibilities
lovingly
you
live
in
alignment
with
your
values
and
you're
willing
to
give
a
little
and
be
flexible
you
understand
it
takes
time
for
changes
to
happen
and
take
root
yet
you
are
grateful
for
where
you
are
on
this
journey
you
know
you
are
exactly
where
you
are
supposed
to
be
right
now
in
life
we
often
need
to
let
go
of
what
does
not
serve
us
in
order
to
make
room
for
change
in
order
to
be
open
to
the
process
of
change
this
is
n't
always
easy
but
you
are
committed
to
doing
what
is
right
for
your
best
interest
and
what
is
in
alignment
with
your
values
rather
than
what
's
easy
with
change
comes
various
emotions
and
you
welcome
them
and
seek
to
feel
them
understand
them
embrace
them
and
then
let
them
go
when
necessary
you
do
n't
give
up
at
times
of
unexpected
pain
or
challenge
you
persevere
all
of
your
thoughts
are
positive
in
your
mind
you
repeat
after
me
I
am
open
to
change
I
am
worthy
of
love
and
success
I
am
confident
I
am
diligent
in
moving
towards
my
desired
success
I
believe
in
myself
and
my
abilities
I
am
courageous
and
brave
I
am
authentically
me
I
am
full
of
joy
I
am
creating
my
own
future
I
follow
my
dreams
with
passion
and
certainty
I
let
go
of
the
past
and
focus
on
the
now
I
am
enough
I
am
grateful
for
today
feeling
confident
and
relaxed
you
get
up
from
the
bench
and
walk
back
through
the
doorway
to
reach
the
bottom
of
the
stairs

fully

thank
you
so
much
for
listening
in
challenging
or
stressful
times
it
is
important
to
connect
with
your
physical
sensations
to
ground
your
energy
to
recognize
your
emotions
as
they
are
and
to
remember
that
you
are
not
your
thoughts
you
are
not
your
feelings
or
your
emotions
at
times
you
may
feel
controlled
by
your
thoughts
and
your
emotions
as
if
they
become
you
but
just
as
you
walk
out
in
the
rain
you
are
not
the
rain
when
you
are
experiencing
anxiety
you
are
not
the
anxiety
anxiety
is
only
an
experience
that
you
are
having
there
is
a
big
difference
in
saying
to
yourself
I
have
anxiety
or
I
am
anxious
versus
saying
I
am
experiencing
anxiety
in
this
moment
the
first
statement
is
claiming
that
sensation
as
your
own
which
your
mind
recognizes
as
something
it
wants
to
hold
on
to
because
you
are
the
owner
of
it
today
is
your
time
to
release
stress
and
anxiety
you
no
longer
need
to
take
ownership
of
it
take
comfort
in
the
fact
that
like
all
moments
this
moment
too
shall
pass
the
more
you
can
tenderly
offer
yourself
love
and
kindness
for
your
experience
the
less
suffering
you
will
experience

each
breath
you
take
to
new
and
fresh
energy
.
Notice
how
new
ideas
begin
to
present
themselves
to
you
.
Bring
up
feelings
of
abundance
,
as
if
you
have
so
much
that
your
cup
pours
over
for
others
to
enjoy
the
abundance
you
have
created
.
Imagine
that
you
are
energized
and
have
a
zeal
for
life
.
you
're
listening
to
power
thoughts
meditation
club
thank
you
for
being
here
i
wonder
now
if
you
can
imagine
a
tree
outside
an
autumn
imagine
the
leaves
changing
color
from
green
yellow
red
brown
and
as
time
goes
by
more
and
more
leaves
just
release
from
the
tree
letting
go
naturally
and
when
winter
comes
the
tree
stands
there
without
the
leaves
some
people
look
at
that
tree
and
think
that
there
's
no
life
there
i
wonder
if
they
've
thought
of
all
the
life
inside
that
tree
all
the
processes
going
on
inside
that
tree
because
when
the
spring
comes
the
new
fresh
green
leaves
grow
out
again
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
autumn
being
there
there
would
have
been
no
room
for
the
new
green
fresh
sleeves
i
'm
sorry
and
it
's
good
to
know
that
your
subconscious
mind
works
the
same
way
naturally
and
safely
it
releases
the
old
and
i
wonder
now
if
you
can
allow
yourself
to
access
that
deeper
inner
part
of
you
that
is
calm
serene
and
focused
in
your
imagination
everything
is
possible
i
'm
sorry
and
the
way
you
imagine
your
mental
pictures
the
way
you
hear
sounds
and
feel
emotions
and
body
sensations
through
this
process
now
that
is
the
right
way
for
you
to
do
this
so
imagine
now
that
directly
in
front
of
you
is
a
piece
of
pure
quartz
crystal
just
let
your
mind
focus
on
that
image
see
its
shape
texture
and
beauty
and
as
you
do
so
there
is
a
warm
gentle
light
that
begins
to
glow
within
the
crystal
which
grows
brighter
and
more
luminous
as
you
focus
on
its
energy
you
become
aware
of
the
crystal
beginning
to
grow
imagine
now
growing
larger
and
larger
brighter
and
brighter
i
'm
sorry
until
the
crystal
is
the
size
of
a
small
house
i
am
sorry
its
light
pours
out
from
each
facet
of
the
crystal
and
bathes
you
with
warmth
and
gentleness
making
you
feel
so
relaxed
so
peaceful
and
so
calm
you
begin
to
explore
the
crystals
in
more
detail
and
find
now
that
there
is
a
door
which
leads
into
the
crystal
the
door
is
slightly
open
allowing
a
brighter
gold
light
to
flow
out
from
the
opening
gently
open
the
door
so
that
you
can
walk
into
the
crystal
you
have
stepped
into
a
crystal
room
which
is
there
just
for
you
this
is
your
own
special
place
the
room
can
be
in
any
shape
or
size
you
wish
it
to
be
just
allow
your
imagination
to
create
the
rule
as
you
want
it
to
be
in
the
colors
that
you
love
and
feel
peaceful
with
make
it
as
comfortable
as
you
want
it
to
be
it
is
your
room
i
'm
sorry
please
imagine
that
you
look
around
the
room
and
realize
that
you
have
not
been
in
this
place
for
a
very
long
time
a
film
of
dust
and
debris
has
dulled
the
brightness
of
the
crystal
room
so
that
the
light
can
not
shine
as
brightly
as
it
should
in
one
corner
of
the
room
is
a
brew
imagine
now
taking
hold
of
the
broom
i
'm
sorry
start
sweeping
up
all
dust
and
debris
sweep
it
all
out
of
the
door
and
as
the
dust
is
swept
outside
imagine
it
being
transformed
bright
glittering
stardust
and
the
debris
is
being
absorbed
into
the
golden
light
where
it
is
transformed
into
positive
vibrant
energy
imagine
the
dust
and
debris
being
negative
thoughts
that
you
now
choose
to
let
go
of
you
can
be
at
peace
now
as
more
and
more
of
the
dust
and
the
breeze
is
swept
away
out
of
that
door
the
light
within
the
crystal
room
glows
brighter
and
brighter
so
that
you
are
surrounded
now

warm
golden
glow

you
feel
safe

and
relaxed

room

waters

all
your
old
negative
thoughts
they
are
being
absorbed
into
the
golden
light
where
it
is
transformed
into
positive
vibrant
energy

is
safe
now
to
release
these
old
thoughts
and
worries
into
the
light
and

silently
after
me

the
mind
as
we
spend
a
few
moments
observing
your
thoughts
many
of
your
thoughts
will
be
stressful
[
Music

by
practicing
observing
your
thoughts
you
can
become
detached
and
reduce
the
amount
of
stress
that
you
experience
as
a
result
of
your
thoughts
breathing
deeply
and
fully
so
just
observing
your
thoughts
and
practicing
allowing
them
without
judgment
or
interaction
[

and
as
you
observe
your
thoughts
remember
thoughts
they
are
just
the
stories
that
we
tell
ourselves
all
the
stories
that
others
tell

so
taking
a
deep

remain

whatever
your

not
interacting
with
them
by
not
repeating
them
or
following
up
with
them
you
will
begin
to
experience
less
stress
and
so
taking
a
breath
now
let
's
shift
your
attention
to
the
body
observing
any
sensations
or
feelings
that
may
be
present
[

feelings

whatever

anything
right

and
observing
you

just
staying
here
with
the
breath
accepting
that
stress
is
a
part
of
life
accepting
that
you
find
it
difficult
and
painful
even
just
allow
yourself
to
be
human
[

your

you
and
in
your

time
when
you
're
feeling
completely
ready
you
can
bring
this

to
an

Hey
there
,
and
welcome
to
this
meditation
to
help
you
reduce
anxiety
.
First
,
I
'd
like
to
invite
you
to
gently
close
your
eyes
and
take
a
nice
,
slow
,
deep
breath
in
,
deeper
than
you
've
taken
all
day
so
far
.
And
as
you
exhale
,
concentrate
on
the
sound
of
my
voice
,
allowing
it
to
ground
you
into
the
present
moment
,
and
giving
yourself
permission
right
now
to
focus
on
you
,
making
yourself
your
first
priority
.
There
is
nowhere
else
you
need
to
be
.
There
is
nothing
else
you
need
to
be
doing
.
For
the
next
several
minutes
,
your
wellbeing
is
your
focus
.
Continue
to
take
slow
,
deep
breaths
,
allowing
each
inhale
to
be
a
bit
deeper
than
the
one
before
it
.
Feeling
your
lungs
expand
out
as
you
inhale
,
holding
it
for
a
beat
and
contracting
back
in
as
you
exhale
.
And
as
you
continue
to
breathe
this
way
,
feel
the
journey
of
the
breath
through
your
body
and
notice
any
places
where
you
may
be
holding
stress
or
anxiety
in
your
body
.
Unfurl
your
brow
,
unclench
your
jaw
.
Let
your
shoulders
drop
down
from
your
ears
.
Open
your
palms
.
And
now
allow
your
breath
to
return
to
its
normal
rhythm
and
pattern
,
but
keep
your
focus
on
it
and
allow
it
to
be
your
anchor
during
this
meditation
.
If
you
get
distracted
by
a
thought
or
a
sound
,
simply
acknowledge
that
it
occurred
and
then
gently
let
it
go
and
return
your
attention
to
your
breath
.
When
we
're
stressed
or
anxious
about
something
,
it
's
often
because
we
do
n't
feel
we
have
control
over
it
,
and
the
sense
of
being
out
of
control
can
make
us
feel
less
safe
,
and
our
emotions
heighten
.
An
understandable
reaction
to
this
is
that
we
try
to
control
the
situation
even
further
.
We
also
tend
to
judge
the
situation
and
even
our
feelings
about
it
.
Those
judgments
and
the
stories
we
tell
ourselves
about
it
often
become
bigger
than
the
situation
itself
,
which
adds
on
even
more
stress
,
and
the
cycle
repeats
.
So
right
now
,
I
invite
you
to
call
to
mind
a
situation
that
you
feel
is
causing
you
anxiety
.
What
judgments
are
you
holding
about
it
?
As
you
name
the
judgment
,
acknowledge
its
presence
.
Now
give
the
judgment
permission
to
drop
away
.
You
do
n't
need
it
anymore
.
Let
it
go
.
And
what
's
the
story
you
've
been
telling
yourself
about
the
situation
?
As
you
recognize
it
,
acknowledge
its
presence
and
give
that
story
permission
to
drop
away
as
well
.
You
may
notice
your
mind
pushing
you
even
harder
to
hold
onto
those
judgments
or
those
stories
.
Recognize
and
acknowledge
those
thoughts
too
,
and
now
allow
them
to
drop
away
as
well
.
Continue
to
use
your
breath
to
anchor
yourself
back
in
the
present
moment
if
you
get
distracted
.
Now
let
's
look
at
that
situation
again
without
the
judgment
or
the
story
you
were
telling
yourself
.
How
does
it
feel
different
?
Has
the
level
of
anxiety
or
stress
changed
?
Instead
,
I
invite
you
to
look
at
the
situation
with
total
curiosity
.
Now
,
as
we
move
into
the
silent
part
of
the
meditation
,
give
yourself
permission
to
open
up
to
the
clarity
and
direction
on
what
the
very
next
step
for
you
to
take
is
.
Not
the
next
five
or
10
steps
,
not
all
the
steps
to
the
end
,
just
the
very
next
step
.
And
continue
breathing
with
your
eyes
closed
.
Just
let
your
attention
start
to
focus
back
on
my
voice
.
Our
judgments
of
and
stories
we
tell
ourselves
about
a
situation
tend
to
exaggerate
our
feelings
of
unease
,
anxiety
and
stress
.
They
can
skew
what
's
actually
going
on
out
of
proportion
and
they
can
block
us
from
seeing
the
truth
of
the
situation
and
allowing
in
the
ease
and
comfort
we
so
desire
.
So
the
next
time
you
're
feeling
anxious
,
remember
to
breathe
and
then
notice
and
acknowledge
the
judgements
about
it
and
the
story
behind
it
.
And
then
let
them
drop
away
and
notice
how
the
anxiousness
eases
.
Focus
on
the
truth
of
the
situation
in
this
moment
.
You
have
everything
you
need
right
now
.
Now
let
's
take
three
more
deep
breaths
together
.
Take
a
deep
inhale
in
,
holding
that
breath
for
a
beat
and
exhale
it
out
.
Again
,
an
even
deeper
breath
than
the
one
before
,
feeling
it
weave
in
and
out
of
your
muscles
and
cells
and
exhale
it
out
.
Last
time
,
your
deepest
breath
yet
sending
that
oxygen
all
the
way
through
your
entire
body
.
And
when
it
reaches
the
top
of
your
head
and
you
're
ready
,
you
can
open
your
eyes
.
Thanks

joining
me
for
this
meditation
and
for
giving
yourself
this
gift

Have
a
great
rest
of
your
day.this
is
a
meditation
on
depression
it
is
not
meant
to
fight
against
depression
or
hide
from
it
but
to
sit
with
it
and
learn
to
develop
a
relationship
with
these
feelings
there
are
many
dark
and
painful
feelings
you
may
be
experiencing
right
now
it
may
be
that
elusive
feeling
of
hopelessness
that
seems
to
permeate
your
thoughts
and
maybe
a
feeling
of
meaninglessness
without
motivation
or
purpose
it
may
just
be
an
unexplainable
sadness
the
Sun
rises
and
sets
and
the
days
go
on
but
you
feel
stuck
lost
trapped
in
a
dark
pit
depression
can
feel
like
a
black
ink
that
soaks
through
your
consciousness
but
there
is
hope
there
is
always
a
tiny
sliver
of
light
that
is
waiting
in
the
distance
to
take
you
back
even
if
it
may
not
feel
that
way
in
the
moment
or
even
if
it
has
n't
felt
that
way
for
quite
some
time
although
you
may
feel
yourself
return
only
in
small
slow
increments
this
meditation
is
intended
to
take
you
on
a
journey
back
to
your
life
back
to
inner
stillness
and
peace
finding
a
light
within
the
darkness
so
let
's
begin
allow
yourself
to
sit
or
lay
comfortably
with
your
hands
resting
gently
at
your
sides
or
on
your
legs
you
may
choose
to
gently
shut
your
eyes
or
keep
them
softly
focused
until
they
become
so
heavy
that
you
can
no
longer
hold
them
open
as
you
get
yourself
comfortable
in
these
first
few
moments
allow
your
attention
to
draw
itself
to
your
breathing
begin
taking
slow
deep
breaths
in
through
your
nostrils
and
start
to
think
to
yourself
simply
in
out
but
every
breath
in
and
out
and
if
it
feels
good
to
you
every
once
in
a
while
take
an
extra
deep
breath
and
just
hold
it
for
a
second
then
slowly
exhale
in
a
long
comforting
release
and
just
fill
yourself
otherwise
breathe
naturally
as
you
begin
to
settle
in
we
'll
start
by
counting
down
from
five
and
with
each
number
just
take
a
slow
healing
breath
and
think
to
yourself
the
short
phrase
focused
and
relaxed
so
begin
now
with
breath
in
five
and
exhale
focused
and
relax
four
focused
and
relaxed
your
breathing
changes
during
this
it
's
perfectly
fine
three
focused
and
relaxed
two
focused
and
relaxed
and
one
focused
and
relaxed
just
let
a
feeling
of
peacefulness
wash
over
you
your
head
may
be
becoming
heavy
your
eyes
may
push
too
close
if
they
have
not
already
every
muscle
relaxing
your
body
sinking
deep
deep
into
the
surface
just
continue
to
keep
a
gentle
and
steady
breath
notice
notice
now
your
entire
body
let
me
feel
a
slight
tingling
in
your
arms
or
hands
or
legs
you
may
even
get
a
sensation
of
the
blood
flowing
throughout
your
body
or
notice
your
heartbeat
you
may
also
notice
yourself
within
your
surrounding
space
or
even
begin
to
feel
yourself
slowly
connecting
with
it
almost
becoming
one
instead
of
a
separate
entity
with
everything
around
you
now
we
will
count
down
once
again
and
this
time
begin
to
just
imagine
a
a
bright
healing
light
in
front
of
you
even
golfing
you
and
surrounding
you
and
with
each
breath
just
think
that
phrase
healing
light
and
see
it
now
five
healing
light
and
end
for
healing
light
and
specializing
see
it
clearly
feel
it
around
you
3
healing
light
so
vivid
to
healing
light
healing
every
nerve
in
your
body
and
one
healing
light
now
as
you
further
draw
attention
to
your
body
and
your
relationship
with
all
that
's
around
you
just
bring
awareness
to
the
very
top
of
your
head
and
as
you
take
another
calming
breath
allow
a
sensation
of
relaxing
energy
to
flow
down
your
head
down
your
head
and
through
your
neck
and
your
shoulders
maybe
just
a
slight
tingling
sensation
we
also
enjoy
a
pleasant
sensation
behind
your
eyes
I
'm
just
allowing
a
soothing
weight
to
push
down
on
them
as
your
head
gains
that
feeling
of
heaviness
feel
that
tingling
wave
move
slowly
down
your
arms
through
your
elbows
and
wrists
and
out
the
very
tips
of
your
fingers
continuing
to
breathe
slowly
and
calmly
feel
it
creep
back
up
and
then
down
to
your
chest
slowly
down
your
door
so
gently
breathing
and
finally
ever
so
slowly
down
your
legs
down
your
legs
and
out
the
tips
of
your
toes
peeling
that
warm
calming
energy
just
flowing
throughout
your
body
and
on
these
next
breaths
just
pretend
that
you
're
standing
elsewhere
in
the
room
watching
your
own
body
within
the
space
and
see
yourself
and
visualize
it
and
imagine
that
you
see
a
warm
glowing
lights
around
you
now
on
the
next
several
breaths
you
will
feel
that
heavy
pressure
of
weight
come
down
on
you
more
and
more
enjoy
this
feeling
this
heavy
feeling
as
you
take
a
breath
in
can
count
with
me
five
and
out
heavy
weight
heavy
weight
and
for
heavyweight
throughout
your
whole
body
three
heavyweight
each
breath
in
makes
you
feel
heavier
weighed
down
to
each
sound
of
my
voice
makes
you
feel
heavier
sinking
sinking
deep
into
the
surface
and
one
heavy
weight
this
continue
to
bring
focus
to
your
breath
and
to
my
words
feeling
that
heaviness
pulling
your
downward
into
the
floor
your
muscles
just
relax
and
give
into
it
all
down
down
down
and
as
you
reach
the
fullness
of
this
weight
take
just
one
minute
to
soak
in
this
heavy
feeling
concentrate
on
that
warm
glow
and
give
yourself
into
the
words
that
follow
just
relax
for
one
minute
what
your
mind
creates
is
not
you
this
depression
is
feelings
it
it
's
not
you
it
has
you
in
its
grasp
your
suffering
is
real
but
hopelessness
is
not
real
the
pain
that
you
're
running
from
and
running
from
is
real
but
the
prison
bars
that
you
feel
trapped
behind
are
not
real
can
you
overcome
this
nightmare
can
you
wake
up
find
your
way
out
of
this
dark
pit
from
this
lonely
isolated
place
that
you
find
yourself
in
you
can
and
you
will
and
you
will
wait
and
practice
and
hang
on
to
hope
because
it
is
there
for
the
taking
it
is
not
lost
you
can
escape
and
you
will
keep
imagining
yourself
in
this
warm
glow
but
imagine
imagine
it
change
in
hue
it
's
a
vibrant
red
around
you
and
then
slowly
slowly
that
becomes
a
bright
blue
a
bright
glowing
blue
and
the
energy
it
begins
flowing
through
you
as
you
notice
every
nerve
every
limb
every
part
of
your
body
is
one
within
this
space
energy
warm
blue
glow
of
light
flowing
through
you
and
now
lastly
as
I
count
you
will
feel
this
weight
slowly
and
gently
begin
to
lift
five
you
may
suddenly
see
and
visualize
the
vastness
and
openness
of
the
sky
in
space
for
even
beginning
to
levitate
becoming
lighter
and
lighter
your
arms
become
feathers
and
you
throw
off
the
heavy
anvils
a
surface
below
you
disappears
three
you
see
yourself
no
longer
bound
by
gravity
or
this
room
breathing
in
and
out
as
that
glow
brightens
and
it
turns
into
an
almost
blinding
white
to
lighter
and
lighter
fearless
alive
free
lighter
and
lighter
floating
floating
up
into
the
vastness
of
the
universe
and
with
one
more
revitalizing
breath
I
count
you
to
one
weightless
floating
here
in
the
vastness
of
space
and
time
allow
yourself
two
more
minutes
just
two
more
minutes
to
float
in
this
open
world
within
your
mind
and
allow
yourself
to
search
for
these
answers
that
you
so
desperately
know
are
within
you
give
yourself
just
two
minutes
healing
is
not
instant
wounds
take
time
to
heal
but
believe
in
your
healing
believe
in
your
meaning
and
purpose
you
are
still
you
you
are
still
alive
you
are
here
you
are
okay
you
are
okay
this
concludes
our
meditation
so
please
return
whenever
you
are
lost
and
whenever
you
are
ready-
Hi
,
I
'm
Anisa
Benitez
,
and
we
'll
be
doing
a
guided
meditation
to
reduce
anxiety
,
so
find
yourself
a
comfortable
seated
position
,
and
we
'll
get
started
.
Bringing
your
hands
to
your
kneecaps
or
your
lap
and
taking
the
first
deep
breath
,
in
through
our
nose
,
(
inhales
)
and
out
through
our
mouth
,
closing
our
eyes
.
Again
,
follow
your
breath
,
taking
a
deep
inhale
through
your
nose
,
and
out
through
your
mouth
.
(
gentle
ambient
music
)
Follow
your
breath
,
taking
another
deep
inhale
through
your
nose
,
and
exhaling
through
your
mouth
.
And
observe
the
breath
.
Sometimes
we
notice
that
our
breathing
is
not
as
deep
as
we
thought
it
was
.
We
might
be
breathing
shallow
breaths
throughout
the
day
.
So
how
can
you
take
more
notice
of
what
it
feels
like
right
now
,
to
be
breathing
as
deeply
as
you
are
?
Now
we
're
gon
na
hold
our
breath
for
a
beat
at
the
top
.
Taking
a
deep
inhale
through
our
nose
,
inhaling
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
holding
our
breath
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
and
exhaling
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
.
Again
,
inhale
through
your
nose
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
hold
that
breath
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
and
release
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
.
Allow
your
breath
to
return
to
its
natural
rhythm
and
see
how
it
feels
now
that
you
're
breathing
deeply
at
the
top
of
your
head
.
Bring
your
awareness
and
your
attention
to
the
top
of
your
head
.
If
there
's
tension
in
your
forehead
,
how
can
you
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
out
and
feel
tension
release
there
?
Sometimes
you
might
be
holding
tension
because
of
concern
or
worry
.
Scrunching
our
forehead
to
send
some
breath
and
awareness
there
.
Take
another
deep
inhale
and
continue
to
bring
your
awareness
down
your
body
as
we
do
this
progressive
relaxation
technique
known
as
body
scanning
.
Bringing
our
awareness
now
to
our
cheeks
.
Maybe
it
was
a
day
of
smiling
,
a
day
of
talking
a
lot
.
How
can
you
bring
your
attention
there
and
release
any
tension
that
might
be
there
in
your
jawline
?
Continuing
to
follow
your
breath
,
taking
a
deep
inhale
in
and
exhaling
.
Bring
your
awareness
down
from
your
jaw
to
your
throat
.
How
can
you
send
a
deep
breath
there
?
And
upon
exhaling
,
feel
the
tension
release
from
your
throat
.
Maybe
there
is
words
unsaid
that
you
might
be
holding
in
from
the
day
.
How
can
you
feel
that
tension
relax
there
in
your
throat
?
Continuing
to
make
your
awareness
graze
down
your
body
,
and
while
it
does
so
,
releasing
any
tension
,
stress
that
we
might
be
carrying
in
our
body
.
Now
in
our
shoulders
,
it
's
so
common
that
we
hike
up
our
shoulders
.
Maybe
'cause
of
cold
,
maybe
'cause
of
tenseness
.
How
can
you
send
a
deep
breath
there
and
feel
your
shoulders
release
and
come
down
?
Feel
your
neck
elongate
.
Continuing
to
bring
your
attention
down
your
body
,
down
your
spine
to
your
sitz
bones
,
and
send
a
deep
breath
there
.
Oftentimes
,
focusing
at
the
base
of
our
body
helps
us
feel
grounded
.
So
take
a
deep
inhale
through
your
nose
,
and
exhale
,
sending
a
big
breath
there
.
Feeling
the
tension
release
,
feeling
ourselves
sink
into
the
earth
,
feeling
ourselves
grounded
in
this
moment
.
Continuing
to
bring
our
awareness
down
our
thighs
,
down
our
calves
,
into
our
ankles
,
to
her
toes
,
to
our
feet
in
contact
with
the
floor
maybe
,
and
send
a
deep
breath
there
.
Really
feeling
yourself
grounded
in
this
moment
.
In
this
moment
.
Again
,
take
a
deep
inhale
through
your
nose
,
the
deepest
that
you
've
taken
all
day
,
and
releasing
the
deepest
exhale
of
all
day
.
And
when
you
're
ready
,
bring
your
attention
back
to
your
surroundings
,
away
from
your
breath
,
but
know
that
you
can
always
come
back
here
.
Open
your
eyes
.
And
thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
tune
into
yourself
,
to
tune
into
your
breath
,
to
feel
grounded
in
this
moment
.

slowly
scan
your
entire
body
allow
your
awareness
to
move
over
each
part
of
your
body
noticing
any
areas
that
if
possible
can
be
softened
and
released
of
tension
begin
this
loving
scan
at
the
top
of
your
head
let
go
of
any
expectations
of
what
you
think
you
might
sense
and
simply
feel
what
is
truly
there
as
you
continue
to
notice
the
sensations
around
your
head
your
face
throat
and
neck
try
to
connect
directly
to
what
you
are
feeling
rather
than
using
your
eyes
to
scan
the
body
or
labeling
specific
sensations
sense
the
feelings
from
within
your
body
do
you
feel
tingling
heat
tightness
tension
or
relaxation
you
might
feel
a
sensation
of
floating
or
lightness
or
heaviness
whatever
you
're
feeling
is
okay
simply
observe
the
sensations
you
may
find
that
simply
paying
attention
to
a
specific
body
part
allows
it
to
relax
and
let
go
as
you
scan
begin
to
use
your
minds
awareness
to
ask
for
relaxation
throughout
your
entire
body
continue
moving
the
scan
of
your
body
down
all
the
way
to
your
feet
and
stay
with
the
sensations
and
this
relaxation
process
as
you
slowly
scan
your
body
fully
notice
any
areas
that
may
still
be
holding
on
to
any
lingering
tension
and
ask
your
body
to
let
go
simply
let
go
of
the
need
to
be
in
control
and
surrender
to
the
support
of
the
surface
below
you
your
body
is
safe
and
supported
notice
any
areas
that
may
still
be
holding
on

any
lingering
tension
and
once
more
ask
your

to
let
go
let
go
of
the
need
to
be
in
control
see
the
tension
melting
away
leaving
your
body
and
going
down
into
the
surface
below
you
to
be
gone
from
your
body
forever
as
you
take
time
now
to
relax
I
'd
like
you
to
recall
a

powerful
and
positive
experience

had
in
the
recent
past

event
I

and
to
your
breath
as
an
observer
see
yourself
smiling
with
a
positive
and

mind
feeling

to
come
out
of
the
state
of

you
are
feeling

the
sounds
around

I
hope

a
wonderful
dayI
will
be
guiding
you
to
be
an
observer
of
where
you
are
in
this
present
moment
to
slow
down
and
go
within
to
be
curious
about
your
physical
sensations
as
well
as
your
emotional
well-being
oftentimes
all
it
takes
is
stepping
back
from
a
situation
where
the
habit
is
reaction
so
you
can
simply
be
aware
of
a
moment
and
respond
more
in
alignment
with
your
true
self
and
what
is
important
to
you
you
can
see
the
present
moment
for
what
it
is
and
Trust
the
journey
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
and
find
a
posture
of
effortless
ease
where
you
can
be
relaxed
yet
alert
you
may
choose
to
lie
down
or
sit
up
when
you
are
comfortable
close
your
eyes
or
soften
your
gaze
to
bring
your
attention
inward
as
you
settle
into
comfort
bring
your
attention
to
your
breath
in
a
moment
I
will
guide
you
to
take
several
deep
breaths
counting
your
inhale
and
making
your
exhale
one
count
longer
than
your
inhale
before
you
do
this
first
observe
the
quality
of
the
state
you
are
in
without
making
any
changes
or
judging
where
you
are
just
check
in
are
you
calm
what
is
your
heart
rate
like
in
this
moment
what
is
the
depth
of
your
natural
breath
what
are
the
sensations
you
are
experiencing
in
your
body
are
you
warm
or
cool
what
else
is
your
attention
drawn
to
as
an
observer
of
your
state
after
noticing
your
current
state
begin
to
mindfully
inhale
and
count
the
length
of
this
breath
then
extend
your
exhale
one
count
longer
than
your
inhale
and
practice
this
for
the
next
few
moments
let
go
of
this
counting
breath
and
allow
your
breathing
to
return
to
its
natural
pace
and
then
scan
your
body
once
more
what
is
there
for
you
now
are
there
any
differences
in
the
quality
of
your
state
your
heart
rate
or
the
sensations
in
your
body
now
look
for
anywhere
that
you
can
let
go
of
the
tendency
to
hold
on
is
there
anywhere
in
your
physical
body
that
you
can
let
go
or
any
emotions
that
you
are
holding
on
to
let
them
go
to
let
go
of
tension
let
go
of
tightness
or
pain
let
go
of
the
need
to
control
or
hold
your
posture
often
we
are
in
fight-or-flight
mode
or
under
physical
or
emotional
stress
and
we
are
n't
even
aware
of
it
today
right
now
I
invite
you
to
find
more
ease
can
you
let
go
of
stress
and
welcome
yourself
into
the
rest
and
digest
mode
what
would
it
feel
like
in
your
body
to
experience
peace
to
find
calm
to
be
still
breathe
this
in
experience
this
right
now
the
stillness
this
calm
state
is
a
time
to
go
within
much
like
winter
is
a
time
of
unseen
growth
a
time
of
presumed
dormant
life
or
inactivity
trust
your
journey
Trust
the
journey
of
the
seasons
winter
is
a
time
to
turn
inward
to
connect
with
yourself
to
be
curious
about
what
is
there
for
you
you
may
sense
the
need
to
slow
down
to
lower
the
intensity
to
rest
and
prepare
for
what
is
to
come
listen
to
your
body
to
your
instincts
what
is
there
for
you
right
now
the
symbolism
of
winter
invites
us
to
quiet
the
mind
it
invites
us
to
wrap
up
in
warmth
and
find
stillness
of
our
soul
to
seek
out
serenity
this
is
a
time
of
introversion
contemplation
and
going
within
see
the
still
state
of
the
life
in
this
season
and
trust
that
there
will
be
growth
once
more
see
the
blessing
in
the
quiet
and
calm
of
the
winter
see
the
hope
for
the
future
of
the
seasons
to
come
as
you
look
inward
what
is
there
for
you
right
now
life
nature
and
every
person
experiences
a
natural
ebb
and
flow
an
inhalation
period
as
well
as
an
exhalation
period
life
is
the
balance
of
giving
and
receiving
of
expending
energy
and
conserving
energy
during
the
winter
season
it
is
a
time
to
withdraw
conserve
and
rest
the
expenditure
of
energy
is
minimal
this
is
the
season
that
we
experienced
the
longest
day
of
the
year
and
then
the
return
of
the
light
and
the
lengthening
of
daylight
it
is
the
season
during
which
our
energies
are
naturally
drawn
inward
when
we
are
inclined
to
be
more
contemplative
give
yourself
permission
to
slow
down
to
dream

go
within
your
dreams
may
be
blurry
and
not
fully
formed
right

plant
the
seeds
of
intention
for
your
dreams
then
open
your
field
of
awareness
and
look
for
signs
look
for
your
dreams
to
solidify
in
time
be
open
to
the
possibilities
as
they
arise
as
you
take
your
winter
season
to
rest
and
go
inward

yourself
to

Howdy
pal
,
and
welcome
to
Yoga
with
Adriene
.
I
'm
Adriene
and
today
we
have
a
meditation
for
you
to
help
you
with
anxiety
.
Happens
to
the
best
of
us
.
It
can
get
out
of
control
fast
.
So
,
thank
you
for
joining
me
in
this
meditation
to
help
quell
and
soften
and
maybe
even
cure
you
from
regular
anxiety
attacks
.
Hope
into
something
comfy
and
let
's
get
started
.
(
gentle
music
)
Alright
,
my
sweet
friends
,
so
we
're
going
to
begin
by
finding
a
comfortable
seat
and
what
was
a
comfortable
seat
yesterday
or
where
you
may
end
up
years
from
now
in
your
meditation
practice
or
just
in
your
body
is
just
always
right
in
a
constant
state
of
flux
for
so
many
reasons
.
So
,
I
'd
like
to
invite
you
today
to
really
consider
what
's
gon
na
feel
best
.
If
it
's
leaning
up
against
a
wall
,
snuggle
up
against
a
wall
.
If
it
's
sitting
on
the
edge
of
your
couch
or
participating
in
a
chair
,
fabulous
.
Or
you
can
lie
down
,
you
can
practice
this
meditation
lying
down
.
So
,
we
definitely
wan
na
come
to
a
place
where
we
feel
comfortable
and
safe
to
do
this
brief
meditation
and
to
practice
the
breath
,
the
pranayama
,
and
so
today
,
just
an
extra
gentle
nudge
to
find
a
comfortable
seat
and
really
be
honest
about
that
.
So
,
if
it
's
not
Sukhasana
today
,
find
something
that
feels
supportive
and
good
.
For
those
coming
into
Sukhasana
,
you
can
even
play
with
the
legs
here
,
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
,
maybe
give
yourself
a
nice
wide
base
.
So
,
we
'll
all
come
into
a
position
that
we
feel
is
the
most
supportive
of
us
today
.
Again
,
it
can
be
lying
down
.
And
when
you
arrive
there
,
really
choose
to
arrive
by
acknowledging
,
oh
I
chose
to
turn
on
this
video
,
I
made
the
choice
to
tend
to
what
's
going
on
,
and
the
first
position
that
I
'm
even
taking
here
was
also
a
choice
to
feel
supported
and
comfortable
.
So
,
basically
we
're
shifting
gears
a
little
bit
from
a
mindset
that
might
feel
a
little
bit
anxious
or
off
,
and
we
're
starting
to
get
organized
in
the
brain
and
body
and
say
,
okay
,
wait
,
whoa
,
whoa
,
whoa
,
I
have
some
power
here
,
a
lotta
power
to
help
guide
myself
out
of
that
which
does
n't
feel
good
and
to
help
guide
myself
to
a
place
that
feels
more
supported
.
So
,
hopefully
by
now
,
you
found
your
seat
for
today
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
your
place
where
you
are
going
to
reside
,
and
when
you
arrive
there
,
you
can
use
the
sound
of
my
voice
now
as
a
guide
,
so
close
your
eyes
and
just
bring
some
awareness
to
your
chest
,
your
heart
space
,
and
depending
on
where
you
're
at
today
,
my
sweet
friend
,
you
might
already
start
to
lean
in
and
just
feel
what
's
comin
'
up
,
let
the
emotional
body
have
a
seat
at
the
table
and
just
notice
.
And
wherever
you
are
today
,
see
if
you
can
begin
to
do
just
that
,
notice
.
Come
into
the
role
of
the
observer
.
So
,
I
find
it
very
helpful
to
close
the
eyes
,
relax
the
shoulders
,
and
bring
your
awareness
to
your
heart
center
or
your
chest
area
and
just
allow
whatever
feelings
come
up
,
whatever
thoughts
,
just
notice
them
.
And
then
notice
where
you
might
be
holding
or
gripping
in
the
body
,
the
fingers
or
the
toes
,
the
ankles
or
the
wrists
,
and
see
if
you
can
use
this
idea
of
the
observer
to
just
notice
all
of
those
points
and
then
in
time
to
allow
just
the
noticing
to
bring
a
softness
,
an
awareness
.
So
,
your
only
real
job
here
in
this
practice
today
is
to
pay
attention
.
We
use
Pranayama
technique
to
help
guide
the
energy
of
the
body
and
to
hopefully
help
relieve
you
from
feelings
that
are
not
serving
,
if
you
feel
stuck
or
off
or
anxious
,
stressed
out
.
Hopefully
,
the
Pranayama
will
allow
us
to
just
shift
our
perspective
or
break
the
pattern
that
we
might
be
stuck
in
.
So
,
after
you
've
taken
a
couple
moments
to
just
arrive
here
and
settle
in
,
acknowledge
that
you
chose
this
,
start
to
notice
your
breath
.
You
do
n't
have
to
do
anything
,
just
acknowledge
it
,
notice
the
natural
ebb
and
flow
.
Notice
what
it
feels
like
as
you
breathe
in
and
notice
what
it
feels
like
as
you
empty
the
breath
out
.
And
then
again
,
bring
your
awareness
to
your
chest
again
,
your
heart
space
,
this
place
that
tends
to
get
really
tight
and
collapsed
when
we
feel
anxiety
,
and
see
if
you
can
start
to
lift
up
through
that
area
,
even
if
it
's
not
a
big
muscular
movement
but
just
a
little
energy
.
Then
allow
that
to
affect
your
breath
,
maybe
taking
a
more
fuller
inhale
,
feeling
the
heart
lift
a
little
,
then
perhaps
feeling
the
shoulders
relax
and
soften
as
you
breathe
out
.
So
,
the
neck
and
shoulders
also
get
a
lot
of
tension
,
a
little
tightness
when
we
feel
anxious
,
so
use
your
inhale
to
feel
expansion
,
and
as
you
start
to
deepen
the
breath
,
use
your
exhale
to
find
a
softness
,
a
surrender
.
Alright
,
you
're
doing
great
.
Stay
with
it
,
stick
with
it
,
eyes
closed
,
shoulders
relaxed
,
lots
of
awareness
around
your
heart
center
,
your
chest
,
your
sternum
.
On
your
next
inhale
,
see
if
you
can
bring
the
tip
of
your
tongue
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
now
,
just
right
behind
the
teeth
,
and
breathe
in
,
and
then
breathe
out
,
jaw
nice
and
soft
.
Again
,
the
tip
of
the
tongue
comes
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
and
we
breathe
in
.
The
jaw
stays
soft
,
not
clinched
,
as
you
breathe
out
.
And
on
your
next
inhale
,
we
're
gon
na
count
to
four
.
Breathe
in
for
four
.
Here
we
go
.
Tongue
comes
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
.
And
we
inhale
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
and
then
just
let
it
go
soft
and
easy
.
Inhale
for
four
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
and
then
let
it
go
.
Notice
how
you
feel
,
stay
present
,
keep
observing
.
Adding
onto
this
ratio
,
now
we
're
going
to
hold
the
breath
,
retain
the
breath
in
between
the
inhalation
and
the
exhalations
for
a
seven
count
.
So
,
we
'll
do
one
breath
cycle
,
just
in
and
out
,
and
then
we
'll
start
with
the
four
.
So
,
breathe
in
deep
here
,
nice
,
soft
,
easy
breath
.
And
exhale
just
to
relax
the
shoulders
,
empty
everything
out
.
I
'm
breathing
in
for
four
.
Inhale
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
holding
,
retaining
the
breath
for
seven
,
six
,
five
,
four
,
three
,
two
,
one
,
and
let
everything
go
.
Notice
what
thoughts
come
up
,
stay
present
,
let
it
unfold
.
Try
to
keep
the
body
still
.
And
the
last
bit
of
the
ratio
is
an
exhale
for
eight
.
So
,
we
'll
inhale
for
four
,
I
'll
guide
you
with
my
voice
.
We
'll
hold
at
the
top
,
retaining
the
breath
mindfully
for
seven
and
then
a
nice
smooth
exhalation
on
the
eight
.
Four
,
seven
,
eight
.
Soften
through
your
fingertips
and
toes
.
One
breath
cycle
,
in
and
out
to
start
,
and
then
we
'll
begin
.
Here
we
go
,
inhale
.
Empty
it
all
out
.
And
inhaling
for
four
,
inhale
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
.
Holding
for
seven
,
six
,
five
,
four
,
three
,
two
,
one
.
And
exhale
for
eight
,
seven
,
six
,
five
,
four
,
three
,
two
,
one
.
Just
notice
how
you
did
,
no
judgment
,
just
observing
.
Inhaling
for
four
,
inhale
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
.
Retaining
on
seven
,
six
,
five
,
four
,
three
,
you
got
this
,
two
,
one
.
And
big
exhale
,
eight
,
seven
,
six
,
five
,
four
,
three
,
two
,
one
.
Inhale
for
four
,
three
,
two
,
one
.
Retain
for
seven
,
six
,
five
,
four
,
three
,
two
,
one
.
And
exhale
for
eight
,
seven
,
six
,
five
,
four
,
three
,
two
,
and
one
.
Inhale
for
four
,
three
,
two
,
one
.
Retain
,
seven
,
six
,
five
,
four
,
three
,
two
,
one
.
Exhale
for
eight
,
seven
,
six
,
five
,
four
,
three
,
two
,
and
one
.
Let
everything
go
.
Stay
with
it
.
Notice
what
comes
up
.
Reside
in
that
wonderful
role
of
the
observer
.
And
wherever
you
are
,
whether
you
're
seated
in
a
chair
or
Sukhasana
or
lying
down
,
you
're
gon
na
find
soft
,
easy
movement
with
the
neck
.
So
,
if
you
're
lying
down
,
you
might
rock
the
head
gently
side
to
side
.
You
might
shake
the
head
yes
and
then
no
.
And
then
you
'll
start
to
bat
the
eyelashes
open
.
Soft
,
easy
movement
with
the
neck
and
shoulders
.
And
then
we
'll
take
a
big
inhale
in
and
exhale
,
sigh
it
out
,
so
this
is
important
,
little
big
of
sound
here
.
Inhale
in
.
Sigh
it
out
.
(
sighs
)
And
one
more
time
,
inhale
.
(
deeply
sighs
)
Hands
come
together
,
notice
how
you
feel
.
Thank
you
for
sharing
your
time
and
your
energy
and
your
practice
with
me
and
all
the
people
around
the
globe
participating
,
working
towards
a
happy
,
healthy
balanced
life
.
Namaste
.
(
gentle
music
)
This
is
a
guided
mindfulness
meditation
on
feeling
overwhelmed
.
Take
a
mental
step
back
from
whatever
you
are
feeling
right
now
.
Allow
yourself
to
be
comfortable
and
to
take
some
slow
and
natural
breaths
.
In
and
out
...
In
and
out
...
Feel
your
breath
and
body
in
your
space
.
Recognize
that
for
just
a
bit
,
you
get
to
find
a
comforting
space
,
here
,
in
your
time
.
Just
you
in
your
space
...
...
hearing
my
voice
.
Enjoying
each
moment
.
Enjoying
your
presence
.
Feeling
okay
with
everything
just
as
it
is
.
Just
for
now
.
Again
feeling
so
relaxed
and
comfortable
with
your
body
here
in
this
space
.
And
taking
natural
gentle
breaths
as
your
focal
point
.
We
would
n't
be
human
if
there
were
n't
times
in
our
lives
when
our
hearts
and
minds
became
overwhelmed
with
a
weight
that
we
are
carrying
.
These
feelings
can
come
from
many
places
.
But
it
is
important
to
know
that
it
is
okay
and
natural
to
feel
this
way
.
What
we
can
practice
is
improving
a
relationship
between
these
thoughts
and
emotions
.
And
recognize
a
response
to
them
.
A
still
and
calm
mind
can
bring
us
back
into
the
present
moment
and
to
tame
that
heavy
weight
that
can
feel
as
if
it
reaches
all
the
way
into
our
soul
.
That
still
mind
can
tame
that
voice
in
our
head
that
says
the
pressure
or
pain
or
expectations
put
upon
us
are
too
much
for
us
to
handle
.
Practicing
this
mindful
meditation
allows
us
to
take
a
gentle
step
back
and
see
the
bigger
picture
.
Just
as
a
violent
storm
will
eventually
clear
to
become
stillness
.
There
is
a
stillness
underneath
.
We
can
be
reminded
of
the
important
phrase
:
''
This
,
too
,
shall
pass
.
''
And
so
,
I
invite
you
to
focus
on
lifting
that
weight
from
your
mind
by
sharing
these
short
phrases
with
me
.
Feel
free
to
repeat
them
after
me
,
either
out
loud
or
in
your
mind
.
Taking
your
time
with
each
one
and
allowing
the
words
and
meaning
to
sink
deeply
into
your
consciousness
.
And
so
,
continuing
that
breath
and
body
focus
,
we
begin
now
:
''
I
recognize
stress
and
anxiety
.
''
``
Like
a
heavy
weight
upon
me
.
''
``
I
watch
and
understand
it
.
''
``
I
allow
myself
to
let
go
.
''
``
Feeling
the
weight
lifting
.
''
``
Floating
away
.
''
``
Floating
away
.
''
``
Calm
and
serene
.
''
``
Still
and
present
.
''
``
Right
here
and
right
now
.
''
Fantastic
.
That
is
the
end
of
the
phrases
.
And
did
you
feel
the
weight
lifting
?
The
burden
just
a
bit
lighter
on
your
shoulders
.
This
may
take
time
and
may
not
be
an
instant
cure
,
but
it
will
help
you
to
step
outside
of
yourself
and
understand
where
this
weight
of
these
overwhelmed
feelings
are
coming
from
.
It
allows
us
to
purposefully
sort
our
thoughts
and
more
clearly
see
a
path
forward
.
And
so
,
enjoying
this
time
,
continuing
that
gentle
breath
and
body
relaxation
focus
,
I
will
just
read
these
phrases
one
after
another
.
You
are
invited
to
just
listen
to
them
and
for
any
tension
that
remains
,
I
will
help
you
to
escape
it
.
Then
I
will
finish
up
the
session
,
just
a
few
minutes
after
.
``
Recognize
any
remaining
stress
and
anxiety
.
''
``
Like
a
heavy
weight
upon
you
.
''
``
Watch
and
understand
it
.
''
``
Allow
yourself
to
let
it
go
.
''
``
Feeling
the
weight
lifting
.
''
``
Floating
away
.
''
``
Floating
away
.
''
``
Calm
and
serene
.
''
``
Still
and
present
.
''
``
Right
here
and
right
now
.
''
This
will
soon
conclude
this
session
.
And
if
you
like
,
take
a
few
last
deep
breaths
,
do
some
shoulder
or
neck
circles
,
maybe
stretch
out
your
arms
.
Just
prepare
yourself
to
finish
up
this
session
and
to
continue
on
into
the
next
part
of
your
day
or
night
.
Be
well
,
be
at
peace
,
be
present
and
mindful
of
your
stress
and
anxiety
.
If
overwhelming
feelings
start
to
overcome
you
,
just
remind
yourself
of
how
you
can
let
go
of
the
weight
like
a
helium
balloon
.
Floating
away
,
leaving
you
calm
and
serene
.
Becoming
still
and
present
,
right
here
and
right
now
.
So
long
for
now.Hello
,
my
loves
.

Bring

take
a
moment
for
gratitude
.
Close

What
are
you
grateful
for
in
the
now
?
No

Take

bring

neck
circles
on

.
While
inhaling
,
slowly
roll
your
head
to
the
right
,
then
back
.
And
then
exhale
to

Gently
,
at
your
own
pace
,
do
one
more
round
,
inhaling
for
the
first
half
and
exhaling
for
the

.
Now
switch

Notice
how
your

now
.
Feel
the
relaxation
flow
through
your
body
.
Now
close
your
mouth
and
breathe
through
your
nose
for
the
rest
of
this
meditation
.
We
will
do
a
full
body
relaxation
,
bringing
awareness
to
one
area
at
a
time
.
First
,
relax
your
forehead
.
Relax
your
eyebrows
.
Relax
your
lips
.
Relax
all
your
facial
muscles
.
Relax
your
scalp
.
Relax
your
brain
.
Relax
your
shoulders
.
Relax
your
arms
.
Relax
your
hands
.
And
relax
your
fingertips
.
Relax
your
heart
.
Relax
your
stomach
.
Relax
your
hips
.
Relax
your
thighs
.
Relax
your
calves
.
Relax
your
feet
.
Relax
your
toes
.
Feel
your
body
totally
relax
.
Allow
yourself
to
feel
the
stillness
of
this
moment
.
There
is
absolutely
nothing
you
need
to
do
other
than
what
you
're
already
doing
right
now
.
Just
relax
,
breathe
,
and
listen
to
this
audio
.
Remember
this
feeling
of
calm
and
centeredness
.
You
can
come
back
to
this
feeling
any
time
simply
by
relaxing
your
mind
and
your
body
,
and
by
choosing
to
live
in
the
present
moment
.
Right
here
,
right
now
.
You
are
safe
.
You
're
safe
here
.
Too
often
,
we
allow
our
minds
to
dwell
on
the
past
or
worry
about
the
future
,
causing
stress
and
anxiety
.
We
ca
n't
change
the
past
and
we
ca
n't
predict
the
future
.
All
we
have
control
over
is
now
.
So
live
in
the
now
and
do
the
best
you
can
in
the
present
moment
.
If
you
think
about
it
,
the
past
and
the
future
are
only
a
figment
of
your
imagination
.
They
're
illusions
,
perceptions
held
by
your
mind
.
The
only
thing
that
's
real
is
the
present
moment
right
in
front
of
you
.
The
present
moment
is
always
your
place
of
power
.
So
take
a
deep
breath
with
awareness
of
the
present
moment
,
right
now
.
Feel
the
energy
you
have
flowing
through
your
body
right
now
.
You
are
alive
,
you
are
here
,
and
you
are

welcome
to
our
meditation
practice
today
's
intention
for
our
time
together
is
to
help
the
mind
find
peace
and
balance
especially
to
help
ourselves
cope
with
the
uncertainty
of
our
world
at
this
time
let
us
begin
today
by
finding
a
comfortable
seated
position
you
can
sit
on
your
bed
against
the
wall
or
on
a
comfortable
cushion
if
you
have
one
let
's
begin
by
closing
our
eyes
and
taking
both
our
hands
and
placing
them
upon
our
heart
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
listen
to
your
own
heart
beating
in
your
chest
what
each
beat
may
it
remind
you
of
this
beautiful
energy
life
prana
that
is
within
you
with
each
beat
may
take
you
deeper
within
at
this
time
into
the
internal
experience
of
your
own
being
take
a
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
no
long
exhalation
out
allowing
yourself
to
find
this
presence
comfort
and
grounding
within
you
slowly
release
your
hands
onto
your
lap
let's
take
the
chin
hand
mudra
where
we
place
the
thumb
and
index
finger
together
allowing
the
palm
of
the
hand
to
face
upward
creating
a
seal
of
energy
within
your
body
close
your
eyes
and
allow
yourself
to
go
even
deeper
focusing
your
awareness
to
the
space
between
your
eyebrows
your
third
eye
simply
focus
and
notice
if
you
begin
to
see
any
shapes
or
colors
or
perhaps
just
complete
emptiness
and
blackness
no
judgment
here
just
simply
observe
[
Music
]
breathing
and
let
it
go
allow
your
body
to
let
go
of
any
tension
in
your
face
relaxing
your
forehead
allowing
your
eyes
to
feel
heavy
and
clenching
your
jaw
complete
relaxation
of
the
face
then
move
this
relaxation
downward
towards
your
shoulders
your
arms
and
then
down
towards
your
hips
and
your
legs
just
let
it
go
simply
stay
present
noticing
the
movement
of
your
breath
as
you
breathe
in
and
out
begin
to
notice
any
sensations
in
your
body
feeling
the
coolness
of
the
air
coming
into
your
nostrils
as
you
breathe
in
and
then
the
warmth
of
the
air
leaving
your
nostrils
as
you
breathe
out
[
Music
]
notice
if
you
begin
to
feel
any
tingling
sensations
in
your
fingers
or
your
toes
whatever
you
are
experiencing
right
now
just
simply
notice
it
be
the
watcher
of
the
experience
itself
allow
yourself
to
find
peace
enjoy
in
this
simple
moment
of
silence
and
disconnection
you
deserve
it
[
Music
]
this
is
a
time
where
it
's
very
normal
for
our
minds
to
begin
to
want
to
cling
to
something
a
specific
thought
a
memory
a
daydream
or
perhaps
even
fear
or
the
future
it
will
go
in
many
directions
and
that
's
okay
simply
remember
to
use
your
breath
whenever
you
feel
yourself
drifting
away
from
this
present
moment
use
your
breath
to
come
back
to
yourself
to
this
moment
right
here
right
now
wherever
you
are
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
a
long
and
soft
exhale
of
breathing
exhale
out
in
this
moment
it
's
okay
to
realize
that
you
may
be
feeling
uncertainty
stress
or
anxiety
in
your
life
but
remember
it
is
simply
a
reaction
to
the
circumstances
around
you
which
is
creating
a
future
that
has
not
happened
yet
and
wo
n't
necessarily
happen
either
even
though
we
may
not
be
able
to
control
what
life
brings
our
way
at
this
time
what
we
do
have
control
over
is
how
we
react
to
the
challenges
or
any
situations
that
are
brought
forward
to
us
so
breathe
in
and
in
this
moment
choose
to
let
all
that
negative
energy
go
release
it
out
of
you
into
the
ground
into
the
earth
choose
to
find
peace
enjoy
in
the
simplicity
of
this
very
moment
simply
being
here
with
yourself
giving
yourself
permission
to
feel
to
be
to
let
go
breathe
in
and
exhale
out
[
Music

you
begin
to
take
your
deep
breaths

as
calm
as
still
and
neutral
as
possible
while
you
breathe
really
engaging
your
abdomen
so
that
it
does
most
of
the
work
when
it
comes
to
breathing
belly
expands
as
you
breathe
in
and
contracts
as
you
breathe
out
and
as
you
feel
yourself
more
and
more
connected
to
your
breath
spend
a
moment
to
scan
through
your
body
from
your
head
to
the
soles
of
your
feet
moving
inch
by
inch
releasing
any
tightness
in
any
muscles
you
may
be
clenching
in
this
moment
your
goal
is
to
only
use
the
muscles
you
need
and
nothing
more
releasing
all
muscles
in
your
face
your
hands
hips
legs
letting
go
of
anything
you
do
not
need
right
now
only
using
the
muscles
necessary
and
as
you
feel
your
body
getting
heavier
you
feel
yourself
relaxing
more
deeply
into
this
moment
you
begin
to
notice
a
ring
of
light
as
if
it
's
wrapping
around
you
creating
a
column
of
white
light
that
completely
encompasses
your
physical
form
you
notice
in
front
of
you
a
bright
red
on
button
and
as
soon
as
you
press
it
the
column
of
light
begins
to
exude
even
more
bright
white
light
whenever
you
get
in
hell
you
breathe
this
white
light
into
your
being
and
on
every
exhale
you
feel
it
flowing
throughout
every
cell
and
every
space
between
every
cell
this
white
light
cleanses
and
clears
any
and
all
stale
stuck
stagnant
energy
tied
to
stress
and
anxiety
and
it
's
okay
whatever
emotions
you
feel
as
this
happens
there
's
no
need
to
push
them
aside
to
run
away
from
them
to
judge
them
if
more
unwanted
feelings
occur
as
you
are
doing
this
cleanse
that
's
just
because
they
are
escaping
do
not
judge
them
just
lovingly
acknowledge
them
with
compassion
in
your
heart
as
you
stay
tuned
in
to
the
beautiful
brilliant
white
light
washing
over
you
cleansing
and
clearing
every
space
within
every
cell
every
space
between
every
cell
you
may
begin
to
notice
a
lightness
occurring
in
your
body
as
if
you
are
feeling
lighter
and
freer
as
this
tube
of
light
continues
to
wash
over
around
and
through
you
and
you
allow
any
emotions
that
are
no
longer
serving
to
freely
pass
through
you
you
lovingly
acknowledge
them
as
they
do
without
getting
hung
up
on
them
without
judging
them
just
having
compassion
as
you
stay
present
with
the
sensation
of
white
light
cleansing
and
clearing
your
entire
auric
field
your
entire
physical
body
your
entire
mental
and
emotional
being
as
you
start
to
feel
lighter
and
freer
you
begin
to
tune
your
awareness
now
to
that
which
you
desire
to
feel
you
've
lightened
the
load
emotionally
here
and
now
it
's
time
to
attune
with
something
greater
you
welcome
in
the
frequency
of
love
and
you
notice
a
tiny
lever
within
the
tube
of
light
and
when
you
flick
it
on
it
raises
the
vibration
in
this
tube
of
light
to
the
energy
of
love
you
feel
it
wrapping
around
you
flowing
within
you
until
all
you
are
is
love
you
feel
the
deep
truth
in
the
affirmation
i
am
love
relax
into
this
love
is
in
every
cell
every
space
within
every
cell
you
let
this
be
your
truth
you
tune
into
how
refreshed
cleansed
and
clear
you
feel
you
say
thank
you
to
yourself
for
doing
this
feel
genuine
appreciation
towards
yourself
for
being
here
and
when
you
're
ready
take
your
time
as
you
begin
to
roll
your
shoulders
wiggle
your
fingers
and
toes
and
bring
your
awareness
back
to
the
world
around
you
opening
your
eyes
as
it
feels
good
to
you
thank
you
so
much
for
being
here
enjoy
this
feeling
and
come
back
to
this
as
often
as
you
need
to
welcome
to
a
guided
meditation
on
declutter
of
the
mind
so
to
start
if
you
are
experiencing
a
bout
of
anxiety
or
a
panic
attack
right
now
just
close
your
eyes
let
's
immediately
bring
our
attention
out
of
the
feeling
and
anxiety
of
this
attack
and
bring
our
attention
into
the
physical
breathe
in
the
way
that
you
need
to
breathe
right
now
but
bring
your
attention
to
the
physical
to
your
body
making
contact
with
the
floor
or
chair
and
just
know
that
you
will
be
okay
and
this
too
will
pass
we
just
need
to
gently
ground
our
attention
right
now
and
something
other
than
our
thoughts
so
you
can
put
your
hands
in
your
lap
and
notice
your
hands
resting
there
allow
your
fingers
to
touch
and
drill
down
your
awareness
on
the
fingers
let
's
continue
to
ground
our
attention
here
and
notice
the
weight
of
your
body
on
the
floor
or
on
the
chair
noticing
gravity
and
sinking
our
awareness
into
the
physical
sensations
you
notice
here
taking
our
minds
out
of
feelings
and
thoughts
and
into
the
body
and
if
your
mind
wanders
simply
bring
it
back
to
the
body
without
judgment
or
frustration
or
adding
more
thoughts
here
and
now
with
our
eyes
closed
let
's
start
a
breathing
practice
let
's
begin
to
wind
down
from
our
previous
state
so
we
're
going
to
breathe
in
for
four
seconds
pause
and
hold
for
one
second
and
then
breathe
out
for
four
seconds
and
there
's
no
need
to
be
perfect
here
just
try
to
follow
the
prompts
as
much
as
you
can
so
breathing
in
one
two
three
four
hold
for
one
and
breathe
out
one
two
three
four
so
let
's
do
another
breathing
in
one
two
three
four
holding
for
one
and
then
breathing
out
one
two
three
four
and
now
see
if
you
can
maintain
this
breathing
rhythm
on
your
own
for
the
next
few
moments
and
again
no
need
to
be
perfect
here
the
less
effort
the
better
and
now
allow
your
body
to
breathe
on
its
own
whatever
way
is
comfortable
for
you
to
breathe
in
return
to
that
and
when
you
do
let
's
start
by
practicing
some
mindfulness
here
so
we
're
going
to
watch
the
breath
for
the
next
few
moments
we
're
not
going
to
change
anything
about
the
breath
or
add
anything
here
we
're
just
using
the
breath
as
an
anchor
for
our
awareness
while
noticing
the
thoughts
and
feelings
that
come
and
go
through
the
mind
so
while
you
watch
the
breath
a
thought
of
panic
or
anxiety
may
arise
and
then
we
just
simply
notice
it
without
any
judgment
or
following
it
with
more
thinking
and
then
gently
returning
our
attention
to
the
breath
again
so
let
's
watch
the
breath
with
an
open
awareness
for
the
next
few
moments
and
if
you
find
that
your
mind
has
wandered
and
become
lost
in
thought
bring
it
back
gently
to
the
breath
and
as
we
watch
the
breath
we
can
count
the
breaths
just
to
ground
our
attention
on
the
breath
a
little
more
so
count
the
in-breath
one
the
out-breath
two
until
we
reach
a
count
of
ten
and
then
begin
the
count
again
and
now
in
the
final
few
moments
just
allow
yourself
to
let
go
of
any
attempt
here
let
's
allow
the
mind
to
do
what
it
wants
for
the
next
few
moments
and
now
open
your
eyes
you
've
just
completed
the
practice
thanks
for
sitting
and
i
'll
see
you
next
time

into
a
physician
of
eve

with
a
straight
back
and
wakeful
posture
you
can
imagine
there
is
an
invisible
string
attached
to
the
top
of
your
head

you
nice
and
tall
allow
your
shoulders
to
fully
rely

rest
your
arms
where
they
're
most
comfortable
close
your
eyes
so
move
your
breath
and
feel
your
body
by
that
and
then
bring
your
attention
to
the
state
of
your
heart
listening
inward
in
a
gentle
compassionate
way
holding
a
space
for
what
's
here
now
tuned
into
the
flow
of
your
breath
allow
your
mind
to
rest
on
the
breath
as
it
goes
in
and
out
of
your
body
follow
each
breath
attentively
silently
recognizing
each
in-breath
and
each
other
who
now
will
relax
our
attention
from
the
breath
and
open
to
a
sense
of
self
love
and
compassion
and
silently
repeat
the
following
word
may
I
be
happy
may
I
be
safe

of
them
with
a
kind
and
open
heart
may
I
be
happy
may
I
be
safe
may
my
heart
feel
peace
and
one
more
time
slowly
savor
each
one
may
I
be
happy
may
I
be
safe
may
my
heart
feel
peace
you
know
gently
returning
to
your
bra
rest
in
this
loving
comforting
space
you
've
created
for
yourself
but
your
breath
continuing
to
welcome
and
soothe
you
allow
your
inhales
and
exhales
to
soothe
any
anxiety
worry
weariness
sadness
what
pain
very
simply
very
lovingly
let
the
breath
arrive
on
the
inhale
you
gently
flow
away
on
the
exhale
now
gently
relax
your
attention
while
growing
up
many
of
us
never
had
the
proper
tools
or
guidance
to
deal
with
difficult
emotions
we
never
learned
to
understand
our
sadness
or
anger
we
were
n't
taught
how
to
calm
our
anxiety
or
soothe
our
frustration
instead
we
learned
to
distract
and
avoid
the
tune
out
unpleasant
feelings
with
numbing
sometimes
destructive
behavior
but
no
matter
what
happens
we
developed
when
younger
in
our
adult
lives
mindfulness
can
help
us
cultivate
the
skills
of
self
soothing
their
meditation
we
learn
how
to
calm
our
emotions
and
settle
our
nervous
system
we
develop
self
acceptance
and
compassion
we
learn
to
tenderly
be
with
whatever
arises
rather
than
run
from
it
these
tools
allow
us
to
care
for
our
own
hurt
so
rather
than
seeking
discomfort
and
distraction
or
destruction
remember
to
reach
for
the
tools
of
self
soothing
be
loving
and
gentle
with
yourself
and
you
'll
be
able
to
hold
your
own
heart
give
yourself
space
to
feel
and
time
to
breathe
and
become
your
own
source
of
soothing
comfort
as
Brian
andreas
said
there
are
days
I
drop
words
of
comfort
on
myself
like
falling
leaves
and
remember
that
it
is
enough
to
be
taken
care
of
by
myself
and
as
we
come
to
the
end
of
the
session
in
these
last
few
breaths
fill
up
your
heart
once
again
with
loving
kindness
now
let
your
awareness
return
to
the
room
hearing
sound
whenever
you
're
ready
open

Yoga
With

is
Benji
and

a
beautiful
meditation
for
mental
balance
and
grounding
.
So
grab
something
to
sit
on
if

.
Hop

something
extra
comfy
and
let

get
started
.
(
bright
music
)
Alright
,
welcome
my
darling
friends
.
We
're
going
to
begin
,
surprise
,
our
practice
today
in
a
comfortable
seat
.
So
take
your
time
.
Just
notice
if
you
're
kind
of
rushing
right
now
here
and
let
's
start
to
slow
it
down
as
you
come
into
a
nice
cross-legged
seat
.
And
I
will
encourage
you
,
particularly
if
you
're
new
to
sitting
(
chuckles
)
in
a
meditation
to
lift
your
hips
up
either
on
a
couch
pillow
or
if
you
have
a
bolster
,
great
.
You
can
fold
up
some
blankets
or
some
towels
are
just
fine
too
.
And
get
to
where
your
hips
are
a
little
bit
higher
than
your
knees
so
you
can
create
these
two
slides
of
the
thighs
down
.
And
as
you
start
to
get
settled
in
here
,
just
start
to
tap
into
that
inner
smile
as
much
as
you
're
willing
.
This
is
my
power
tool
,
my
secret
weapon
that
I
often
talk
about
so
it
's
not
so
secret
,
but
just
as
you
settle
in
you
can
start
to
kind
of
feel
the
benefits
of
this
time
that
you
're
taking
for
yourself
by
softening
and
,
yeah
,
tapping
into
that
inner
smile
.
It
can
be
like
,
``
I
'm
doing
this
.
''
Or
,
``
Oh
my
god
,
I
need
this
.
''
Whatever
it
is
just
tap
into
a
little
joy
that
you
're
taking
this
short
but
valuable
time
for
yourself
.
Benji
's
relaxed
.
If
you
're
not
relaxed
,
we
'll
get
you
there
or
we
'll
try
.
Hopefully
by
now
you
're
in
your
seat
.
Getting
settled
in
.
And
if
you
are
working
with
your
back
right
now
,
we
'll
say
that
,
feel
free
to
sit
up
against
a
wall
or
you
can
even
do
this
in
a
chair
.
You
just
want
to
make
sure
that
your
spine
is
nice
and
long
.
And
on
that
note
,
let
's
take
a
moment
here
to
gently
tuck
the
chin
.
And
bring
more
awareness
to
the
spine
.
So
that
could
be
sitting
up
tall
.
It
could
just
be
noticing
your
pattern
.
Again
,
just
gently
tucking
the
chin
.
Feeling
that
length
as
you
do
so
through
the
back
of
the
neck
.
And
best
you
can
bringing
more
awareness
to
your
spine
.
And
if
you
have
n't
already
,
allow
your
hands
to
soften
,
fingertips
to
soften
just
wherever
feels
good
and
then
as
I
often
invite
you
to
do
in
practice
same
thing
here
.
Just
notice
what
feels
good
today
.
Whether
you
need
a
more
grounding
palm
.
Right
?
Energetically
,
I
'm
here
.
(
exhales
)
``
I
'm
doing
this
.
I
need
to
breathe
.
``
I
need
this
time
for
myself
.
''
Or
maybe
you
're
feeling
pretty
good
and
this
is
more
preventative
care
today
.
So
open
those
palms
up
baby
.
Allow
yourself
to
be
a
little
more
vulnerable
,
open
.
So
,
both
are
vulnerable
,
but
you
get
to
decide
.
And
really
we
're
connecting
the
brain
to
the
body
here
.
So
there
's
so
much
that
goes
into
these
little
gestures
and
making
decisions
for
yourself
.
If
you
know
a
mudra
you
want
to
take
it
now
,
please
do
.
And
then
if
you
have
n't
already
,
close
your
eyes
.
Allow
your
eyelids
to
get
heavy
here
.
And
if
for
whatever
reason
you
're
not
comfortable
with
the
eyelids
closed
,
just
soften
your
gaze
gently
down
past
your
nose
.
(
light
music
)
Alrighty
and
we
've
begun
.
Chin
slightly
tucked
.
Neck
long
.
Hands
,
arms
,
carefully
placed
.
Fingers
soft
.
Let
's
start
by
noticing
any
sounds
around
us
.
Wherever
you
may
be
today
.
Or
maybe
you
're
relishing
,
silence
.
As
we
start
to
settle
in
and
ground
down
,
allow
any
extra
movement
,
patterns
,
just
fidgeting
,
see
if
you
can
allow
them
to
soften
as
you
build
a
little
structure
for
your
mediation
here
.
In
time
finding
stillness
with
more
ease
and
being
kind
if
you
're
noticing
a
lot
of
fidgeting
or
patterns
.
No
worries
.
That
's
why
we
're
here
.
To
observe
.
With
kindness
.
To
welcome
balance
and
clarity
to
both
the
mental
and
emotional
self
.
Now
most
of
you
have
already
likely
begun
to
notice
your
breath
but
if
not
allow
me
to
roll
out
the
red
carpet
,
to
bring
fresh
picked
flowers
to
your
doorstep
and
welcome
you
to
just
notice
with
a
loving
kindness
your
natural
breath
.
And
as
you
begin
to
notice
the
rhythm
of
your
natural
breath
today
,
see
if
you
can
take
it
one
step
further
.
Inviting
the
mind
to
also
notice
what
the
breath
does
to
the
body
.
As
you
breathe
in
and
out
.
Notice
,
if
you
can
,
what
parts
of
the
body
move
as
you
breathe
in
.
And
see
if
you
can
notice
how
gravity
tends
to
take
over
as
you
breathe
out
.
So
we
have
this
sense
of
a
rise
and
a
fall
,
nice
and
easy
,
nothing
forced
.
Just
noticing
what
moves
as
you
breathe
in
.
And
embracing
the
gravity
as
you
breathe
out
.
Now
you
can
keep
going
just
as
is
or
I
'll
bring
another
fresh
bouquet
to
your
door
and
invite
you
to
deepen
the
breath
just
a
bit
.
Bringing
more
consciousness
,
more
loving
awareness
to
that
inhale
and
watching
the
ripple
effect
as
you
breathe
in
.
And
using
that
exhale
to
ground
down
.
Relax
the
shoulders
.
Relax
your
jaw
.
Allowing
your
inhale
perhaps
to
be
a
little
deeper
,
more
full
.
And
perhaps
,
when
you
're
ready
,
allowing
your
exhale
to
be
longer
.
Think
of
it
as
a
beautiful
extension
.
Breathing
out
as
you
ground
down
,
down
,
down
.
Now
go
ahead
and
let
your
nice
conscious
deep
breaths
rest
.
Return
to
just
a
nice
,
easy
,
natural
rhythm
and
flow
.
With
so
much
love
and
a
gentle
,
just
gentleness
,
see
if
you
can
reestablish
this
awareness
in
your
spine
by
maybe
lifting
your
heart
,
gently
sitting
up
a
little
bit
taller
.
And
you
might
feel
,
if
you
're
doing
this
with
your
eyes
closed
,
as
though
you
grow
a
little
bit
longer
and
taller
in
the
spine
.
And
as
you
rest
easy
here
in
your
seat
,
soften
the
skin
of
the
forehead
,
relax
the
jaw
and
again
use
a
gentle
exhale
to
relax
the
shoulders
down
.
You
're
more
than
halfway
through
your
mediation
.
So
as
thoughts
come
to
your
mind
,
to
your
soul
,
just
acknowledge
them
and
come
back
to
a
loving
awareness
of
your
breath
.
So
beginning
to
deepen
the
breath
a
little
bit
.
Again
here
,
see
if
you
can
find
something
new
as
you
breathe
in
.
Embracing
gravity
as
you
breathe
out
.
And
now
one
final
invitation
.
As
you
continue
to
breathe
and
lean
into
the
dance
of
feeling
the
inhale
lift
you
,
a
rise
.
And
feeling
the
exhale
ground
you
,
the
fall
of
the
breath
.
As
you
lean
into
that
balance
of
the
two
,
I
lovingly
invite
you
to
just
bring
your
mind
's
eye
to
the
tip
top
crown
of
your
head
.
Place
your
attention
there
.
And
then
imagine
,
head
over
heart
,
heart
over
pelvis
.
Then
from
the
crown
tip
top
of
your
head
in
your
own
way
,
whatever
this
means
to
you
,
draw
a
line
from
the
top
of
your
head
down
through
the
center
core
channel
of
your
being
,
all
the
way
to
the
base
of
the
spine
.
So
we
've
placed
a
light
rope
or
pipeline
,
a
cylinder
,
whatever
it
is
for
you
,
this
awareness
from
the
crown
of
the
head
to
the
base
of
the
spine
.
And
see
if
you
can
allow
that
action
,
that
awareness
,
to
affect
your
breath
or
to
at
least
notice
if
it
changed
the
way
your
holding
yourself
up
here
with
each
inhale
.
And
the
way
you
're
using
your
exhale
to
continuously
ground
down
.
And
for
the
last
minute
here
,
we
'll
take
that
line
from
the
crown
to
the
base
of
the
spine
and
just
hang
with
me
,
my
friends
,
continue
that
line
down
.
Past
your
physical
body
,
down
into
the
earth
.
Continue
that
line
down
to
the
core
of
the
earth
.
And
then
notice
how
that
makes
you
feel
.
Notice
if
,
and
it
may
not
,
if
that
effects
the
way
you
carry
yourself
here
,
the
way
you
breathe
in
and
the
way
you
breathe
out
.
Now
take
three
final
conscious
breaths
.
Finding
balance
and
a
sense
of
calm
or
peace
between
the
dance
of
the
rise
and
the
fall
.
The
lift
and
the
ground
.
The
earth
and
the
sky
.
Then
release
your
conscious
breaths
.
Rest
easy
here
as
you
slowly
drop
your
chin
to
your
chest
.
Try
to
keep
the
shoulders
relaxed
here
as
you
gently
open
your
eyes
.
Can
flutter
the
eyelashes
open
.
And
when
you
're
ready
,
gently
lift
your
head
.
Cue
the
birds
outside
my
window
.
We
'll
bring
the
palms
together
.
Just
take
one
quiet
little
beat
here
to
notice
how
you
feel
.
And
we
'll
close
it
off
by
bowing
together
and
whispering
,
Namaste.Our
own
self-talk
can
contribute
to
the
pain
and
low
self-esteem
that
is
sometimes
associated
with
rejection
or
failure
.
This
relaxation
script
will
help
you
to
identify
the
feelings
and
thoughts
related
to
rejection
and
failure
,
and
to
change
this
negative
thinking
.
Get
comfortable
in
a
quiet
place
where
you
can
relax
.
Begin
to
relax
your
body
by
first
tensing
a
muscle
group
,
and
then
releasing
to
create
a
feeling
of
relaxation
.
Start
with
your
arms
.
Close
your
hands
into
tight
fists
,
and
tense
your
hands
and
arms
...
all
the
way
up
to
your
shoulders
.
Hold
this
tension
for
a
count
of
five
:
one
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
.
Now
release
,
allowing
your
hands
and
arms
to
become
limp
.
Rest
for
a
count
of
ten
.
One
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
...
six
...
seven
...
eight
...
nine
...
ten
.
Now
repeat
,
tensing
the
muscles
of
your
hands
and
arms
...
holding
very
tight
...
very
tense
...
one
..
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
.
Relax
,
letting
the
muscles
become
relaxed
and
loose
.
Relax
your
arms
even
more
deeply
...
allowing
a
feeling
of
heaviness
to
grow
with
each
number
...
one
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
...
six
...
seven
...
eight
...
nine
...
ten
.
Focus
on
your
legs
now
,
tensing
these
muscles
from
your
hips
...
to
your
knees
...
to
your
feet
.
Hold
the
muscles
of
your
legs
very
tightly
...
filled
with
tension
...
hold
for
a
count
of
five
.
One
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
.
Release
this
tension
,
allowing
your
legs
to
relax
completely
.
Rest
for
a
count
of
ten
.
One
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
...
six
...
seven
...
eight
...
nine
...
ten
.
Repeat
,
tensing
your
legs
again
,
holding
very
tightly
...
feeling
the
tension
in
each
muscle
...
one
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
.
Now
relax
,
releasing
the
tension
you
have
been
holding
in
your
legs
.
Relax
completely
,
feeling
your
legs
become
heavier
and
more
relaxed
...
relaxing
even
more
with
each
number
...
one
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
...
six
...
seven
...
eight
...
nine
...
ten
.
Tense
the
muscles
of
your
back
now
...
one
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
...
and
release
...
one
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
...
six
...
seven
...
eight
...
nine
...
ten
.
Tighten
the
muscles
of
your
chest
and
stomach
.
Hold
..
one
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
...
and
release
...
one
...
two
...
three
...
four
...
five
...
six
...
seven
...
eight
...
nine
...
ten
.
Now
practice
holding
and
releasing
tension
with
your
breath
.
Breathe
in
deeply
and
hold
that
breath
.
Hold
...
feeling
the
tension
...
and
then
relax
...
breathe
out
...
releasing
all
the
tension
with
your
breath
.
Take
another
breath
,
breathing
in
deeply
...
and
hold
.
Now
release
,
relaxing
as
you
breathe
out
.
Allow
your
next
breath
to
occur
naturally
...
smoothly
breathing
in
as
much
air
as
you
need
,
and
then
releasing
the
air
naturally
,
exhaling
fully
.
Breathe
slowly
in
and
out
...
letting
your
breaths
occur
at
whatever
pace
is
comfortable
for
you
.
Feel
your
breathing
slow
naturally
...
becoming
very
calm
.
(
Pause
)
Now
that
you
are
feeling
more
relaxed
,
think
about
the
feelings
of
rejection
or
failure
you
would
like
to
deal
with
.
Think
about
a
time
when
you
felt
rejected
or
a
time
when
you
believe
you
failed
in
some
way
.
When
did
this
rejection
or
failure
event
occur
?
What
happened
?
Imagine
this
rejection
or
failure
event
in
detail
,
remembering
as
much
as
you
can
.
(
Pause
)
Now
think
about
how
you
felt
when
the
rejection
or
failure
event
was
happening
.
What
emotions
did
you
experience
at
the
time
?
(
Pause
)
What
about
afterward
?
What
emotions
did
you
have
after
the
rejection
or
failure
occurred
?
(
Pause
)
How
are
you
feeling
right
now
,
as
you
think
about
the
rejection
or
failure
?
Notice
how
you
feel
emotionally
and
physically
in
this
moment
.
(
Pause
)
Now
examine
the
thoughts
that
go
along
with
your
emotions
.
Picture
the
event
when
you
experienced
rejection
or
failure
.
What
kinds
of
things
were
you
saying
to
yourself
during
and
after
?
For
example
,
perhaps
you
were
rejected
by
a
friend
who
told
you
that
he
did
not
want
to
see
you
.
You
may
have
had
thoughts
such
as
:
He
does
not
like
me
.
I
am
no
good
.
I
am
not
fun
to
be
around
.
No
one
likes
me
.
I
’
m
a
loser
.
These
types
of
negative
thoughts
lead
to
the
unpleasant
feelings
you
experienced
.
If
you
want
to
feel
better
,
you
can
change
the
negative
thoughts
to
more
realistic
ones
and
your
feelings
will
become
more
positive
.
One
way
to
change
negative
thinking
is
through
affirmations
to
build
confidence
and
increase
self-esteem
.
Let
’
s
work
on
increasing
confidence
now
.
First
,
focus
again
on
relaxing
your
body
and
calming
your
mind
.
Let
all
your
previous
thoughts
go
,
and
be
only
in
the
here
and
now
.
(
Pause
)
Breathe
away
the
thoughts
,
just
allowing
them
to
pass
...
letting
each
thought
slip
away
...
You
do
not
need
to
do
anything
in
particular
...
just
relax
...
and
let
your
thoughts
pass
,
without
dwelling
on
any
of
them
...
(
Pause
)
As
you
begin
to
relax
,
allow
yourself
to
open
up
to
the
idea
of
feeling
confident
and
secure
...
strong
and
positive
...
imagining
what
it
would
be
like
to
experience
positive
feelings
and
believe
positive
things
about
yourself
.
Imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
look
at
a
situation
with
new
eyes
...
with
self-respect
...
Imagine
how
you
would
handle
rejection
or
failure
as
a
self-respecting
,
confident
person
...
treating
yourself
with
respect
and
love
...
Think
about
the
idea
of
accepting
imperfection
...
of
allowing
mistakes
and
learning
from
them
...
think
about
all
the
true
,
realistic
things
you
could
tell
yourself
if
you
experience
rejection
or
failure
.
Instead
of
saying
,
“
he
does
not
like
me
''
or
“
no
one
likes
me
,
''
you
can
tell
yourself
the
following
types
of
statements
:
I
can
not
read
people
’
s
minds
.
The
thing
that
happened
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
does
not
like
me
.
There
are
people
who
care
about
me
.
I
care
about
me
.
Instead
of
saying
,
“
I
am
no
good
,
''
you
may
say
:
I
made
a
mistake
.
Everyone
makes
mistakes
.
I
do
not
like
making
mistakes
,
but
I
can
learn
from
my
errors
.
I
choose
to
learn
from
this
experience
.
I
have
many
good
qualities
and
I
also
have
flaws
.
Think
about
the
more
positive
,
more
realistic
,
encouraging
statements
you
could
say
to
yourself
about
the
situation
where
rejection
or
failure
occurred
.
(
Pause
)
It
is
normal
to
experience
rejection
sometimes
.
You
are
a
human
being
and
all
human
beings
go
through
rejection
.
Remind
yourself
that
you
are
a
good
person
.
It
is
okay
to
feel
upset
.
Know
that
these
feelings
will
pass
.
You
will
soon
feel
better
.
Be
kind
to
yourself
.
The
most
painful
rejection
is
the
act
of
treating
yourself
unkindly
.
Be
a
support
to
yourself
.
(
Pause
)
You
are
a
human
being
with
both
strengths
and
weaknesses
.
It
is
okay
to
have
flaws
.
You
,
like
all
people
,
will
make
many
mistakes
in
your
life
.
Errors
are
part
of
being
human
.
We
all
fail
from
time
to
time
.
Failing
at
one
thing
does
not
make
you
a
failure
and
it
does
not
generalize
to
you
as
a
person
.
A
failure
at
one
thing
can
be
better
described
as
a
mistake
,
rather
than
a
failure
.
Failing
at
many
things
,
that
is
,
making
many
mistakes
,
is
a
healthy
,
normal
process
.
Successful
people
fail
many
times
.
You
are
a
successful
person
.
Mistakes
can
be
turned
into
positives
by
growing
from
them
.
(
Pause
)
Now
you
can
simply
relax
...
no
need
to
focus
on
anything
at
all
.
Just
drift
...
relaxing
...
(
Pause
)
Allow
a
feeling
of
confidence
to
begin
inside
...
deep
within
your
core
...
it
may
feel
like
warmth
...
such
a
solid
,
strong
feeling
...
Let
this
confidence
grow
...
getting
bigger
...
radiating
from
inside
you
...
filling
your
entire
body
from
head
to
feet
...
shining
from
you
and
lighting
up
the
room
you
are
in
...
It
feels
so
good
to
be
filled
with
confidence
.
Allow
the
confidence
to
grow
...
all
on
its
own
...
it
grows
without
you
doing
anything
at
all
...
getting
bigger
...
even
stronger
...
feel
the
confidence
that
fills
you
...
Any
negativity
in
your
life
can
be
a
trigger
for
this
confidence
to
grow
.
Rejection
or
failure
...
upsetting
events
...
anything
negative
in
your
life
can
remind
you
of
this
feeling
of
confidence
you
have
right
now
.
When
something
negative
happens
,
find
that
a
feeling
of
confidence
begins
inside
and
grows
...
filling
you
with
strength
and
poise
to
deal
with
the
situation
.
You
can
feel
good
and
feel
confident
even
in
circumstances
that
are
less
than
ideal
.
Negative
situations
can
be
a
cue
for
this
confidence
to
grow
.
Feel
the
confidence
fully
,
right
now
...
filling
you
with
complete
confidence
and
calm
.
(
Pause

Keep
a
feeling
of
confidence
with
you
as
you
complete
this
relaxation
exercise
.
Take
a
few
moments
to
re-awaken
your
mind
and
body
.
Open
your
eyes
and
look
around
the
room
,
becoming
re-oriented
to
your
surroundings
.
Stretch
if
you
want
to
,
and
feel
your
body
waking
up
.
When
you
are
fully
awake
and
alert
,
you
can
return
to
your
usual
activities
,
feeling
confident
and
calm.Take
a
moment
to
settle
into
a
comfortable
position
.
Notice
now
,
how
you
are
feeling
....
how
you
are
doing
right
now
in
this
moment
.
How
does
your
body
feel
?
Scan
your
body
for
a
moment
now
,
starting
at
your
feet
,
simply
noticing
how
your
body
is
feeling
.
Notice
your
feet
...
ankles
...
legs
....
hips
.
Continue
scanning
your
body
,
moving
upward
to
your
stomach
,
back
,
chest
,
sides
.
Mentally
scan
your
hands
,
arms
,
and
shoulders
...
your
neck
,
head
,
and
face
.
Where
is
your
body
the
most
tense
?
Where
is
your
body
the
most
relaxed
?
Just
notice
the
state
of
tension
and
relaxation
in
your
body
.
Notice
how
your
body
relaxes
...
bit
by
bit
....
without
any
effort
on
your
part
.
See
how
your
muscles
become
a
little
bit
looser
...
less
tense
....
naturally
,
just
because
you
are
taking
a
moment
to
sit
quietly
and
relax
.
Without
any
effort
or
input
from
you
...
without
you
even
trying
...
your
body
becoming
slightly
more
relaxed
with
each
passing
moment
.
Think
about
your
body
image
...
what
is
body
image
?
Maybe
you
think
about
the
picture
in
your
mind
you
have
of
what
your
body
looks
like
.
Maybe
it
's
the
ideas
you
have
about
your
body
...
your
feelings
about
your
physical
self
.
Perhaps
body
image
is
is
a
vision
of
how
you
think
your
body
should
be
.
What
does
body
image
mean
to
you
?
Take
a
moment
now
to
consider
your
thoughts
and
ideas
about
your
own
body
.
How
are
you
feeling
right
now
,
thinking
about
your
body
image
?
You
might
feel
neutral
,
content
,
comfortable
,
uncomfortable
,
satisfied
,
dissatisfied
,
happy
or
unhappy
,
angry
,
afraid
,
accepting
.....
maybe
a
combination
of
things
....
contradictory
feelings
are
common
....
and
it
is
okay
to
feel
however
you
are
feeling
.
What
might
it
be
like
to
accept
your
body
,
just
as
it
is
?
What
if
you
felt
okay
about
your
physical
self
?
Imagine
for
a
few
moments
what
that
would
be
like
.
Think
about
a
time
in
your
life
when
you
felt
accepting
of
your
physical
self
-
your
whole
self
,
or
even
part
of
yourself
.
Which
parts
of
your
body
are
the
easiest
for
you
to
accept
?
Imagine
if
you
could
accept
your
body
as
a
whole
,
rather
than
as
a
collection
of
individual
parts
.
You
have
been
doing
some
difficult
thinking
these
last
few
moments
.
Let
's
take
a
step
back
now
,
mentally
,
to
relax
.
Breathe
in
,
deeply
.
And
breathe
out
.
In
....
and
out
.....
In
...
and
out
.....
Keep
breathing
deeply
,
slowly
.
It
feels
good
to
take
deep
,
calm
breaths
.
Just
relax
for
a
moment
while
you
notice
your
breathing
.
Just
notice
your
breaths
for
a
moment
.
(
pause
)
If
there
are
any
areas
where
you
are
feeling
tense
,
direct
your
attention
to
these
areas
as
you
breathe
....
imagining
that
each
breath
in
brings
relaxation
...
and
each
breath
out
expels
tension
.
Breathing
in
relaxation
...
and
breathing
out
tension
.....
each
breath
relaxes
you
further
.
(
pause
)
Now
I
will
say
some
body
image
affirmations
.
You
can
repeat
these
if
you
wish
,
or
simply
relax
as
I
talk
.
Each
affirmation
is
true
....
even
if
it
may
not
seem
true
right
now
.
Let
's
begin
the
affirmations
.
I
am
okay
the
way
I
am
.
I
can
accept
myself
the
way
I
am
.
My
body
is
acceptable
just
the
way
it
is
.
I
am
an
okay
person
.
I
accept
this
body
I
am
in
.
There
is
no
need
to
be
perfect
.
My
imperfections
make
me
unique
.
I
am
perfectly
alright
just
the
way
I
am
.
My
body
is
a
functioning
whole
.
I
am
human
,
and
all
humans
have
flaws
.
I
can
accept
my
imperfections
.
I
free
myself
from
judging
my
body
.
I
am
okay
just
the
way
I
am
.
I
accept
myself
.
Now
that
you
have
repeated
some
affirmations
,
take
note
of
how
you
are
feeling
.
What
was
it
like
to
repeat
or
listen
to
the
affirmations
?
It
is
okay
to
feel
however
you
are
feeling
right
now
,
good
or
bad
.
Accept
the
variety
of
feelings
you
may
have
.
Take
a
moment
now
to
just
relax
.
Let
all
the
worries
and
tension
go
as
you
breathe
slowly
in
...
and
out
....
in
....
out
.....
continue
to
breathe
slowly
,
deeply
....
naturally
.
When
you
are
ready
to
return
to
your
waking
level
of
consciousness
,
slowly
leave
this
relaxed
state
you
are
in
.
Keep
with
you
a
feeling
of
calm
,
while
becoming
more
awake
and
alert
.
Wake
up
your
body
and
your
mind
.
Move
your
arms
and
legs
a
little
and
feel
your
muscles
reawakening
.
I
'll
count
up
now
from
5
to
1
,
and
when
I
reach
1
you
will
be
fully
awake
and
ready
to
return
to
your
usual
activities
.

may

racing
through

take
a

in
the

exhaling
when

your

is
relaxed
and
your

a
moment
and
allow
the
feelings
to
rise
knowing

protected
I
understand
that
you
feel
stressed
and
anxious
right
well
that
's
okay
that
's
right
it
's
okay
to
feel
anxious
in
fact
it
's
quite
normal
anxiety
is
a
normal
sensation
whenever
we
are
stressed
or
concerned
I
would
like
you
to
remember
that
whenever
you
feel
anxious
again
whenever
you
feel
yourself
dwelling
on
small
details
and
becoming
increasingly
anxious
you
will
tell
yourself
that
it
's
okay
to
feel
this
way
and
it
will
soon
pass
[

that
's
right
these
feelings
will
soon
pass
now
picture
yourself
tomorrow
you
become
engaged
in
your
usual
pattern
of
obsessive
thoughts
and
feeling
anxious
you
begin
to
have
recurrent
persistent
obsessive
thoughts
maybe
you
feel
like
you
have
touched
something
that
's
contaminated
and
you
feel
the
urge
to
clean
yourself
several
times
or
maybe
you
're
unsure
whether
you
locked
your
door
or
perhaps
you
feel
the
urge
to
obsessively
count
or
arrange
things
in
a
certain
way
whatever
it
is
that
your
thoughts
are
obsessing
over
you
do
not
perform
the
ritual
see
yourself
having
obsessive
thoughts
but
remaining
in
the
same
place
and
not
doing
the
ritual
for
whatever
reason
[

if
you
become
consumed
by
the
thoughts
of
not
locking
your
door

not
turning
off
a

check
on
it

at

you
tell

later
if

starting
to
creep
back
into

just
practice
now
take
a

calm
returning
to

get
through
this
hard
time

do
not
perform
the
ritual

are
choosing
to
remain
calm
instead

resisting
the
obsessive
thoughts

can
do
it
[

now
imagine

two
months
from

you
are
still
doing
a

compulsions
to
pass

you
may
still
be
having
some
anxiety
in
other
areas

to
pass
without
taking
any
action

you
will
continue
to

take
longer
to
pass
than

allow
the
time
needed
until
once
again
you
feel
calm

you
want
to
have
complete
control
over
these

begin
to
realize

have
the

over
your

around

begin
to
feel
more
confident

of
yourself
as

goes
by

are
so
excited
at
the
prospect
of
being
free
of
obsessive
thoughts
you
know
that
anxiety
is
a
part
of
life
and
you
will
feel
anxiety
whenever
you
worry
about
the
future
and
what
's
next
but
whenever
the
thoughts
begin
to
be
obsessive
you
take
control
and
breathe
deeply
allowing
the
initial
thoughts
and
worries
to
pass
bringing
yourself
back
to
the

awakening
of
the
senses

how
you
are
inextricably
linked
through
the
breath
to
the
world
outside
of

allow
each
in-breath
to

watch
the
way
the
breath
flows
in
through
your
chest
filling
the
entirety
of
your
lungs
causes
the
stomach
to
expand
to
rise
and

might
witness
an
expansion
of
the
chest
area
as

an
opening
up

expansion

from
this
place
of
complete
awareness
and
presence
tune
into
the
heart
space
drawing
your
awareness
to
the
center
of
the
chest
and
allow
your
heart
to
expand
as
it
expands
envision
it
touching
all
possibilities
for
the
day
ahead
you
might
envision
a
white
or
a
golden
light
radiating
out
from
the
heart
making
contact
with
the
future
that
is
continually
unfolding
you
if
you
find
any
anxious
or
fearful
thoughts
arise
just
witness
them
without
becoming
attached
to
them
and
gently
focus
back
into
your
heart
space
or
into
the
golden
light
radiating
from
this
space
within
you
you
focusing
now
on
your
highest
potential
and
visions
for
the
day
it
might
be
goals
that
you
want
to
achieve
things
that
you
want
to
set
out
to
do
or
you
need
to
do
and
allow
any
cluttering
or
limiting
thoughts
to
naturally
fall
away
and
there
is
no
need
to
force
anything
out
of
existence
or
to
judge
or
condemn
anything
that
might
be
arising
less
than
your
highest
potential
arises
simply
notice
it
acknowledge
it
and
allow
it
to
dissipate
you
whatever
we
envision
on
a
regular
we
start
to
manifest
in
the
outer
world
consciously
reflect
for
a
moment
on
whatever
it
is
your
highest
self
wishes
to
manifest
in
your
life
or
more
specifically
in
the
day
ahead
what
is
the
deepest
yearning
of
your
heart
what
is
the
energy
you
wish
to
carry
with
you
throughout
your
day
continuing
to
feel
into
the
hearts
glow
and
compassionately
allowing
conflicting
mental
chatter
to
subside
as
a
higher
truth
reveals
itself
you
begin
to
narrow
in
on
what
is
it
you
wish
to
manifest
considering
for
a
moment
that
you
already
hold
whatever
it
is
you
may
take
a
few
moments
to
breathe
into
this
feeling
as
if
it
is
already
present
within
you
allow
your
thoughts
to
be
clear
and
conscious
stemming
from
the
core
of
who
you
are
you
might
like
to
consider
in
the
words
of
Rumi
what
you
seek
is
seeking
you
just
allow
the
openness
of
your
heart
to
hold
the
truth
that
whatever
you
hope
to
embody
is
already
here
it
is
already
present
within
you
you
just
coming
back
to
the
body
now
and
taking
in
a
few
more
grounding
breaths
before
setting
a
powerful
intention
for
the
day
ahead
allow
yourself
to
be
completely
here
truth
to
go
and
nothing
you
need
to
achieve
as
we
increase
our
ability
to
be
fully
present
and
limiting
thoughts
begin
to
fall
away
and
you
begin
to
embody
more
deeply
the
truth
of
who
you
are
silent
and
steady
breaths
here
rooting
yourself
in
the
expanding
energy
of
this
morning
you
so
from
this
place
of
pure
presence
but
you
now
to
set
one
more
clear
and
powerful
intention
for
your
day
consider
whatever
it
is
you
wish
to
embody
and
state
it
to
yourself
as
if
it
were
already
here
for
instance
if
you
are
longing
is
for
self-confidence
and
esteem
consider
a
phrase
such
as
I
am
confident
and
complete
or
if
the
stability
and
safety
are
of
your
highest
concern
perhaps
an
affirmation
like
all
of
my
deepest
needs
are
being
met
just
allow
yourself
to
become
very
clear
and
focused
on
your
intention
as
you
begin
to
repeat
it
to
yourself
with
each
full
breath
so
take
a
few
moments
of
silence
here
as
you
align
your
intention
with
your
breath
letting
the
words
fill
you
up
entirely
again
and
again
but
just
a
few
moments

wherever
you
are
now
resting

to
soften
the
area
around
the
eyes
and
when
you
are

up

naturally
shifts
in
any
way
again
there
is
no
need
to
intervene
or
manipulate
its
rhythm
but
you
may
find
that
as
you
tune
into
the
breath
it
might
naturally
deepen
slow
down
or
adjust
itself
in
some
other
way
just

notice
if
this
is
true
for
you
and
also
notice
if
it
is
not
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
way
to
notice
the
breath
simply
observe
it
however
it
comes
and

wherever
it

throughout
this
meditation
the
mind
may
entangle
itself
in
thoughts
of
the
past
or
in
visions
of
what
might
come
to
be
if
for
when
it
does
simply
acknowledge
this
tendency
as
a
movement
away
from
this
present
moment
before
drawing
your
attention
back
to
the
breath
if
thoughts
arise
simply
witness
them
for
a
moment
with
compassion
and
non
judgment
before
returning
to
your
unchangeable
Center
no
matter
how
frequently
they
crop
up
no
that
is
entirely
normal
for
thoughts
to
rise
and
entirely
possible
to
gently
let
them
go
use
the
breath
as
your
anchor
at
any
point
during
this
meditation
to
reground
yourself
in
the
physical
place
that
you
rest
[

draw
your
awareness
now
to
the
stomach
noticing
its
natural
rise
and
for
as
breath
moves
through
you
in
our
busy
day
to
day
activities
we
often
breathe
primarily
from
the
chest
restricting
our
breaths
range
of
movement
this
shallow
breathing
engages
our
stress
response
and
releases
a
surge
of
hormones
that
temporarily
increase
our
blood
pressure
[
Music
]
as
we
naturally
expand
the
breaths
movement
moving
it
effortlessly
into
the
stomach
we
activate
the
relaxation
response
this
deeper
breathing
pauses
out
of
an
inner
state
of
stress
and
helps
us
to
sink
effortlessly
into
stillness
and
soon
into
a
state
of
deep
sleep
continue
to
focus
your
attention
on
the
stomach
noticing
just
how
far
the
breath
can
go

take
a
moment
now
to
acknowledge
this
physical
place

it
possible
to
simply
witness
the
space
you
occupy
to
witness
the
physical
world

are
intimately
connected

and
warmth
for
the
rest
of
this
meditation
just
taking
in
a
few
deep
breaths
here
and
releasing
another
deep
breath
in
[
Music

and
letting
go
with
each
breath
in
feeling
your
body
relaxed
deeper
and
deeper
as
you
let
go
now
seeing
if
you
can
gently
shift
your
focus
with
your
eyes
still
closed
up
to
the
area
between
your
eyebrows
just
above
your
nose
this
is
sometimes
called
the
third
eye
area
and
no
straining
here
just
seeing
if
you
can
see
visualize
this
space
you
may
see
nothing
it
could
appear
as
all
black
you
may
see
shadows
or
flickers
of
color
white
purple
or
black
[

whatever
you
see
here
is
all
normal
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
just
be
with
this
[

now
as
you
stare
into
this
space
it
begins
to
open
up
and
you
begin
to
see
the
expanse
of
the
beautiful
night
sky
you
're
now
outdoors
it
's
a
warm
balmy
night
you
are
safe
laying
in
a
peaceful
field
on
a
rug
you
feel
comforted
and
supported
by
the
beauty
of
the
Bible
black
night
sky

you
've
never
seen
the
stars
shining
so
brightly
each
one
of
the
trillions
of
stars
above
you
presents
their
own
magic
to
you
comforting
you
keeping
you
safe
offering
their
presence
and
reminding
you
that
you
too
are
part
of
this
enormous
expanse
you
have
never
been
separate
always
connected
and
at
one
[

the
stars
have
been
waiting
for
this
moment
to
connect
with
you
and
for
you
to
connect
to
them
as
you
pee
up
into
the
night
sky
it
's
almost
as
if
the
stars
are
reaching
down
to
you
Olly
Olly
wanting
to
be
closer
to
you
leaving
trails
of
white
sparkly
streaks
as
they
do
so
whispering
to
you
the
beauty
you
see
above
you
is
the
beauty
you
have
within
they
continue
to
slowly
fall
towards
you
almost
like
some
scene
from
an
imaginary
fairy
tale
it's
almost
as
if
you
could
reach
out
right
now
and
you
could
touch
them
these
stars
are
puncturing
the
night
sky
with
their
brilliant
light
and
there
are
trillions
of
them
galaxy
after
galaxy
some
of
the
stars
are
so
close
to
you
and
yet
others
are
beyond
the
beyond
the
depth
of
these
shining
beings
of
light
is
incomprehensible
as
you
witness
this
in
awe
and
wonder
just
allow
your
eyes
to
wander
across
the
entirety
of
this
expanse
you
can
see
some
shooting
stars
across
the
patches
of
darkness
like
a
memory
they
are
there
one
moment
and
gone
the
next
reminding
you
again
of
the
fleeting
moments
of
life
all
of
life
is
transient
nothing
stays
the
same
and
this
too
is
okay
you
see
that
some
of
the
stars
are
dim
whilst
others
are
shining
brightly

is
a
nearly
cloudless

overhead
something
begins
to
appear
out
of
the
distance
as
it
makes
its
way
closer
to
the
air
space
directly
above
you
you
come
to
see
that
it
is
an
eagle
soaring
freely
across
the
clear
blue
sky
take
a
few
moments
to
observe
the
smooth
curves
it
makes
as
it
wings
and
carves
its
way
through
the
air
it
is
both
strong
and
light
moving
with
both
confidence
and
grace
the
Eagle
continues
to
dance
through
the
sky
as
it
makes
its
way
closer
and
closer
to
the
earth
it
appears
to
be
approaching
the
very
field
you
rest
in
but
nothing
about
its
approach
frightens
you
in
some
strange
way
you
feel
that
this
bird
is
no
different
from
you
and
you
know
deep
in
your
gut
that
in
no
way
can
it
harm
you
in
fact
the
eagle
brings
you
a
sense
of
inner
peace
courage
and
lightness
you've
heard
much
about
Eagles
knowing
that
their
presence
is
an
invitation
to
move
deeper
into
freedom
soaring
high
above
the
sky
Eagles
suggests
to
us
that
now
might
be
the
time
to
look
at
things
from
a
new
perspective
these
birds
grant
confidence
and
courage
to
look
ahead
they
symbolize
new
beginnings
self
growth
and
personal
awareness
as
you
observed
the
Eagles
flight
you
are
blessed
with
its
wisdom
feeling
refreshed
and
renewed
[

you
witness
the
eagle
landing
on
the
soft
earth
beside
you
as
you
rise
to
your
feet
to
welcome
its
arrival
the
two
of
you
meet
eyes
and
then
bow
your
heads
in
respect
of
one
another
with
the
great
eagle
just
before
you
you
stretch
your
arm
out
to
touch
its
soft
code
noticing
how
calm
and
relaxed
it
is
within
this
environment
and
in
your
presence
the
eagle
is
free
unbounded
by
fear
and
anxiety
as
it
welcomes
your
tender
touch
it
reminds
you
that
you
too
have
nothing
to
fear
breathing
deeply
soaking
in
this
sense
of
freedom
and
on
your
next
exhale
you
release
all
residual
tension
that
lingers
in
body
and
mind
you
are
complete
at
peace

this
great
bird

the
Eagle
takes
one
last
look
at
you
and
turns
preparing
to
take
off
once
again
preparing
to
set
sail
in
the
clear
vast
blue
sky
as
the
great
bird
turns
its
head
you
realize
that
by
some
divine
magic
you
have
become
this
eagle
gazing
up
towards
the
open
sky

off
to
release
everything
that
tethers
you
to
the

soar
high
above
the
earth

and
unbounded

Eagle
came
for
just
a
moment
to
show
you
that
her
way
is
your
way
that
nothing
stands
in
your
way
of
experiencing
what
it
feels
like
to
be
entirely
free
and
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
this
realization
you
lift
off
from
the
security
of
the
earth
to
experience
a
complete
lightness
in
your
being

saw
ever
lessly
above
the

extending
your
arms
with
the

strength
and
grace
shown
to
you
by

I
invite
you
now
to
come
into
a
comfortable
lying
down
position
ensuring
that
your
body
is
resting
with
ease
wherever
you
are
you
might
want
to
use
blankets
or
cushions
to
support
you
as
you
find
comfort
in
the
physical
space
you
occupy
take
a
few
releasing
breaths
here
allowing
a
deep
sigh
to
leave
your
body
on
your
next
outward
breath
[
Music

to
begin
our
journey
into
tranquility
take
a
moment
to
observe
that
the
stillness
of
your
physical
body
[
Music

as
day
transforms
into
night
and
the
Sun
fades
away
we
are
invited
to
enter
a
much
needed
period
of
rest
and
rejuvenation
as
we
sink
into
the
stillness
of
night
rest
assured
there
is
nothing
we
need
to
consciously
engage
in
or
take
care
of
we
can
trust
that
the
body
will
work
by
its
way
of
its
innate
wisdom
so
take
a
moment
now
to
quietly
observe
the
miracle
of
this
body
feel
into
its
heaviness
as
you
sink
further
into
the
surface
beneath
you
you
might
want
to
notice
now
where
there
might
still
be
movement
despite
the
sense
of
stillness
notice
where
breath
brings
subtle
movement
to
the
body
how
it
causes
the
chest
and
stomach
to
expand
on
each
inhalation
and
to
fall
away
on
each
exhalation
[
Music

observe
how
beautifully
this
gentle
movement
intertwines
with
a
deeper
sense
of
complete
stillness
as
you
take
a
few
deep
breaths
here
in
silence

if

shifted

acknowledge
these

lure
us
into

we
begin
to
witness
our
mental
movements

our
power

discernment
easing

experience
greater
clarity

a

take
a
moment
now

observe
the
mind
you
might
find
that
thoughts
and
associated
feelings
linger
beneath

an
otherwise
very
still

as

tell

return
your

at
any
point
you
can
use
the

a
tool
to
draw
you
back
into
a
present
state
of
awareness
when
we
draw
our
attention
to
the
mind
during
meditation
we
might
find
that
enchanting
visuals
accompany
the
stories
we
tell
the
point
of
this
meditation
is
not
to
banish
or
look
down
upon
this
imagery
that
we
create
unconsciously
meditation
is
simply
a
call
to
become
more
conscious
and
mindful
of
what
is
happening
inside
of
our
heads
the
mind
is
a
powerful
tool
that
can
either
entrap
us
in
imagery
informed
by
fear
or
that
can
be
used
to
enhance
our
lives
and
create
more
positive
beliefs
ideas

dreams
take
a
few
moments
now
to
practice
being
an
outside
observer
of
thoughts
and
imagery
that
appear
in
the
mind
simply
become
more
attuned
to
the
way
that
your
thoughts
give
life
to
your
visions
knowing
that
you
hold
the
power
to
turn
your
attention
away
from
any
storyline
that
is
guided
by
fear
worry
or
anxiety
[

rather
than
force
your
thoughts
to
become
something
you
might
deem
to
be
more
positive
take
this
time
to
let
all
thoughts
dissolve
continue

on
the

can
imagine
that
all
negative
and
unconstructive

being
released
allow

to
become
completely
at

another
moment
to

down

welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
to
help
you
release
all
muscular
tension
and
to
help
you
fall
into
a
deep
and
peaceful
sleep
over
the
course
of
this
meditation
you
will
be
guided
to
bring
your
awareness
to
each
area
of
the
body
to
feel
into
it
to
tighten
it
and
then
to
release
it
completely
allowing
the
entire
body
to
come
to
a
state
of
total
relaxation
so
before
we
begin
this
journey
just
ensure
that
all
end
of
day
matters
are
taken
care
of
if
you
require
an
alarm
to
be
set
just
quietly
set
it
now
if
there
are
blinds
that
need
to
be
drawn
or
bright
lights
that
can
be
turned
off
just
take
care
of
these
small
matters
before
settling
into
a

lying
down
position
you
[

wherever
you
are
ensure
that
the
spine
and
neck
are
straight

relaxed
and
that
you
are
supported
in
any
way
that
you
need
take
your

to
adjust
any
cushions
or
blankets
so
that
you
are
as
comfortable
as
possible
in
this
very
moment
[

set
an
intention
now
to
fully
let
go
through
both
body
and
mind
as
we
enter
a
process
of
complete
release
[
Music
]
you
now
let
's
begin
by
becoming
more
mindful
of
this
exact
moment
in
time
and
space
begin
by
drawing
your
awareness
to
your
ears
and
to
all
the
sounds
that
you
may
currently
be
infiltrating
through
them
as
you
open
your
hearing
simply
observe
all
the
sounds
that
come
from
subtle
hums
to
more
prominent
noises
outside
[
Music
]
without
judging
or
labeling
these
sounds
practice
remaining
in
a
state
of
deep
awareness
as
vibrations
filter
into
your
eardrums
and
as
they
disappear
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
allow
the
Mayans
tendencies
to
categorize
to
label
and
the
judge
to
step
aside
as
you
simply
witness
these
noises
as
dynamic
expressions
of
life
as
simple
and
subtle
vibrations
of
energy
now
expand
your
awareness
of
this
present
moment
by
beginning
to
observe
the
physical
space
you
rest
in
notice
the
air
that
touches
your
skin
and
the
material
world
that
supports
and
surrounds
you
take
a
few
moments
to
observe
each
inch
of
your
body
that
is
in
contact
with
the
physical
world
you
might
come
to
notice
the
temperature
of
your
body
and
surfaces
around
you
you
might
observe
the
textures
of
blankets
and
pillows
that
brush
against
your
skin
and
you
might
even
observe
a
barely
describable
feeling
of
support
of
safety
or
of
heaviness
as
you
sink
further
into
the
surface
beneath
you
[
Music
]
notice
if
the
body
's
formation
or
sensory
experience
changes
in
any
way
as
you
become
more
mindful
of
this
physical
space
you
are
in
[
Music
]
become
more
mindful
now
of
your
breath
quietly
observing
the
rhythm
and
depth
of
its
present
form
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
to
be
mindful
does
not
mean
to
change
or
to
manipulate
the
present
moment
in
any
way
that
the
mind
deemed
to
make
better
or
worthy
to
the
contrary
mindful
awareness
asks
us
to
open
to
and
to
accept
this
moment
exactly
as
it
is
so
with
this
in
mind
see
if
you
can
open
to
your
breath
exactly
as
it
is
right
now
releasing
any
judgment
or
expectation
for
it
to
feel
any
differently
and
it
presently
does
[
Music
]
you
if
a
natural
deepening
occurs
allow
this
simply
noticing
it
as
a
natural
movement
of
energy
further
into
your
being
continue
to
observe
the
breath
for
a
few
more
moments
feeling
into
the
expression
of
each
inhalation
and
each
exhalation
notice
the
feeling
of
air
entering
through
your
nasal
cavity
filling
your
lungs
and
pressing
upward
against
your
belly
and
then
notice
the
same
dynamic
movement
in
Reverse
observing
any
sensations
connected
to
your
fall
exhalation
[
Music
]
just
breathe
here
in
mindful
awareness
for
a
few
more
silent
moments
[
Music
]
if
the
mind
wanders
at
any
point
during
this
meditation
see
if
you
can
refrain
from
judgment
as
you
compassionately
call
your
attention
back
to
the
present
moment
it
is
in
the
mines
nature
to
wander
but
with
that
said
we
can
use
the
power
of
our
intention
to
refocus
our
attention
back
on
this
present
moment
this
refocusing
is
what
helps
us
to
enter
an
expanding
state
of
complete
of
relaxation
in
just
a
few
moments
we
will
enter
into
a
full-body
scan
through
which
you
will
become
deeply
aware
of
the
presence
of
tightness
in
the
body
and
then
of
the
feeling
of
complete
relaxation
you
will
be
guided
to
witness
tighten
and
release
each
area
that
we
pass
allowing
each
part
of
the
body
that
come
to
deep
rest
and
complete
ease
in
preparation
for
a
peaceful
night
's
sleep
[
Music

as
much
as
possible
see
if
you
can
align
tightening
movements
with
your
inhalations
and
all
movements
towards
release
with
your
exhalations
just
breathe
naturally
in
between
each
muscle
group
that
we
work
on
so
before
we
begin
into
this
body
scan
I
invite
you
to
make
any
adjustments
now
that
will
help
you
to
feel
into
the
entirety
of
your
body
you
might
find
that
it
is
easiest
to
access
each
muscle
when
in
a
straight
line
down
position
on
your
back
however
if
this
is
not
comfortable
for
you
come
into
a
position
that
is
as
neutral
as
possible
while
remaining
comfortable
[

ensure
that
the
chest
is
open
with
shoulders
drawing
away
from
the
ears
allow
your
breath
to
continue
to
be
in
the
background
of
your
awareness
secondary
only
to
your
gently
shifting

of
the
physical

begin
by
noticing
your

into
them

consciously
tighten
just

on
your
next
inhalation
observing
what
it
feels
like
for

to
be
pulled
inwards
completely

resistance
to
any
pain
you
currently
have
have
had
in
the
past
or
any
expectations
of
pain
you
may
resist
pain
because
you
do
n't
like
to
be
uncomfortable
as
this
is
human
nature
this
causes
the
pain
to
be
pushed
down
and
not
processed
and
then
released
this
resistance
to
the
sensations
in
your
body
and
the
negative
associations
with
these
feelings
can
cause
additional
suffering

most
needed
if
those
signals
are
ignored
or
suppressed
they
will
continue
showing
up
and
eventually
they
will
become
more
obvious
and
impossible
to
ignore
recognize
what
you
are
feeling
in
this
moment
as
you
acknowledge
your
experience
allow
it
to
be
just
as
it
is
with
acceptance
this
is
not
to
say
you
are
giving
up
you
are
simply
not
adding
more
suffering
by
resisting
reality
invite
ease
into
the
areas
that
may
be
asking
for
your
attention
approach
this
practice
with
acceptance
as
you
give
yourself
permission
to
have
whatever
your
experience
is
let
go
of
resistance
let
go
of
judgment
practice
surrender
now
begin
to
move
your
attention
slowly
over
your
physical
sensations
begin
at
the
top
of
your
head
and
scan
your
body
's
sensations
from
the
inside
with
a
flowing
attention
all
the
way
down
to
the
soles
of
your
feet
as
your
attention
flows
from
one
part
of
your
body
to
another
pause
and
linger
on
any
areas
that
seem
to
be
asking
for
your
attention
give
each
of
these
sensations
the
notice
that
it
is
needing
your
physical
body
is
your
anchor
or
your
reminder
for
this
meditation
so
if
you
find
that
your
mind
has
wandered
off
into
a
story
or
thoughts
about
something
else
lovingly
bring
it
back
to
the
current
experience
of
your
sensations
notice
any
areas
of
your
body
where
you
are
experiencing
feelings
and
simply
be
with
the
sensations
without
labeling
good
or
bad
or
telling
a
story
of
why
these
sensations
are
here
stay
with
the
felt
sense
of
the
sensation
and
let
go
of
your
ideas
about
it
welcome
anything
and
everything
you
are
feeling
be
with
the
actual
experience
of
your
body
and
let
go
of
your
resistance
to
this
experience
what
would
it
be
like
for
you
to
encourage
a
release
a
letting
go
of
any
tension
as
you
move
your
awareness
around
your
body
let
go
of
your
attention
and
attachment
to
what
is
n't
working
for
you
let
go
of
what
is
no
longer
serving
you
this
tension
may
have
been
there
to
serve
you
at
one
point
but
now
you
can
let
it
go
perhaps
it
resonates
with
you
to
visualize
a
letting
go
you
may
see
a
beautiful
bird
fly
off
into
the
sky
or
a
feather
being
carried
by
a
light
breeze
or
any
other
visualization
of
letting
go
that
shows
up
in
your
mind
once
your
awareness
reaches
your
feet
bring
it
back
to
the
top
of
your
head
and
begin
again
this
time
as
your
attention
flows
through
your
body
focus
on
any
areas
of
ease
and
softness
within
your
body

quality
of
this
area

area

is
available
to
you

areas
of
ease
to
spread

that
what
you

on

your
sense
of
peace

move
and
grow

rays
of

outward
in
all
directions

my

Jason
Stevenson

meditation
designed
to
promote
more
peaceful
and
soothing
dreams
whether
you
have
experienced
difficult
dreams
lately
or
an
absence
of
dreams
this
meditation
will
help
to
set
the
stage
for
beautiful
imagery
to
visit
you
as
you
sleep
while
listening
to
this
meditation
simply
allow
your
body
to
rest
and
your
mind
to
expand
as
you
drift
into
beautiful
places
using
the
power
of
your
attention
so
now
I
asked
you
to
take
a
few
deep
breaths
opening
yourself
to
this
powerful
practice
of
visualization
before
we
set
the
stage
for
better
dreams
to
come
to
you
let
's
take
a
journey
into
the
body
and
mind
exactly
as
it
is
now
to
prepare
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
entirely
comfortable
lie
down
in
any
position
that
is
comfortable
to
you
however
you
rest
remain
mindful
of
keeping
the
neck
in
line
with
the
spine
to
help
promote
a
sense
of
openness
and
relaxation
within
the
body
proper
posture
even
when
sleeping
helps
to
promote
positive
feelings
that
will
carry
over
into
sleep
making
any
final
adjustments
necessary
just
allow
yourself
to
come
into
a
state
of
complete
stillness
the
only
observable
movement
now
should
be
the
breath
as
it
makes
its
way
through
the
body
opening
the
chest
and
expanding
the
belly
as
you
witness
your
body
coming
into
stillness
notice
how
the
breath
naturally
slows
itself
you
might
even
allow
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
to
leave
the
body
on
an
exhalation
releasing
any
unnecessary
tension
or
concern
that
lingers
in
your
body
begin
to
open
your
senses
up
to
the
world
around
you
beginning
with
your
ears
start
to
become
mindful
of
the
quiet
space
that
is
around
you
and
of
any
sounds
that
pass
through
this
sense
of
stillness
when
opening
the
ears
there
is
no
need
to
search
for
noises
or
to
label
any
sounds
that
arise
simply
observe
whatever
is
going
on
around
you
through
your
sense
of
hearing

become
aware
now
of
the
physical
space
you
reside
in
noticing
the
sensations
of
the
surface
beneath
you
of
any
cushions
or
blankets
above
or
against
you
notice
if
there
is
any
particular
sensation
of
the
air
around
you
does
it
appear
to
be
still
or
in
flow
is
it
cool
warm
or
possibly
neutral
[
Music
]
just
allow
your
physical
body
and
its
capacity
to
feel
the
ground
you
deeper
into
this
present
moment
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
I
invite
you
now
to
move
a
little
further
into
the
body
following
the
movement
of
air
into
your
lungs
tune
in
to
the
sensations
of
it
as
it
enters
and
leaves
you
as
the
belly
rises
and
as
it
falls
[
Music
]
without
attempting
to
change
the
breath
in
any
way
allow
it
to
carry
you
further
into
the
experience
of
inner
stillness
even
amidst
its
constant
flow
allow
the
physical
body
to
settle
reaching
a
point
of
complete
ease
and
comfort
if
you
feel
is
necessary
to
adjust
your
position
in
any
way
just
move
slowly
and
mindfully
as
you
come
into
a
place
of
deeper
comfort
[
Music
]
take
a
moment
now
to
observe
the
mind
you
might
find
that
thoughts
and
associated
feelings
linger
beneath
the
surface
of
an
otherwise
very
still
state
if
thoughts
are
present
simply
observe
them
from
a
place
of
compassion
and
non
judgment
just
see
if
it
's
possible
to
observe
them
as
an
outsider
without
becoming
consumed
by
the
stories
they
tell
and
then
return
your
attention
to
the
breath
[
Music
]
at
any
point
you
can
use
the
breath
as
a
tool
to
draw
you
back
into
a
present
state
of
awareness
when
we
draw
our
attention
to
the
mind
during
meditation
we
might
find
that
enchanting
visuals
accompany
the
stories
we
tell
the
point
of
this
meditation
is
not
to
banish
or
look
down
upon
this
imagery
that
we
create
unconsciously
meditation
is
simply
a
call
to
become
more
conscious
and
mindful
of
what
is
happening
inside
of
our
heads
the
mind
is
a
powerful
tool
that
can
either
entrap
us
in
imagery
informed
by
fear
or
that
can
be
used
to
enhance
our
lives
and
create
more
positive
beliefs
ideas
and
dreams
take
a
few
moments
now
to
practice
being
an
outside
observer
of
thoughts
and
imagery
that
appear
in
the
mind
simply
become
more
attuned
to
the
way
that
your
thoughts
give
life
to
your
visions
knowing
that
you
hold
the
power
to
turn
your
attention
away
from
any
storyline
that
is
guided
by
fear
worry
or
anxiety
[
Music
]
rather
than
force
your
thoughts
to
become
something
you
might
deem
to
be
more
positive
take
this
time
to
let
all
thoughts
dissolve
continue
to
focus
on
the
breath
moving
through
you
as
you
sink
further
and
further
away
from
mental
distractions

with
each
inhalation
you
might
envision
yourself
being
infiltrated
with
lightness
peace
and
contentment
and
with
each
outward
breath
you
can
imagine
that
all
negative
and
unconstructive
thoughts
and
beliefs
are
being
released
allow
yourself
to
become
completely
at
ease
within
this
present
moment
take
another
moment
to
feel
into
your
physical
body
knowing
that
you
are
entirely
supported
in
this
moment
physically
emotionally
and
spiritually
and
that
even
through
this
simple
act
of
slowing
down
you
are
beginning
to
invite
more
positive
dreams
into
your
evening
sleep
[

from
this
deep
sense
of
underlying
stillness
I
invite
you
now
to
use
the
power
of
your
mind
to
enter
a
visual
place
of
peace
beauty

serenity
there
are

what

what

a
recognizable
beat

be
growing
in

the
sounds
disorderly
like
the
unpredictable
pitter-patter
of
rain

whatever
brings
you
peace
to
arise
in
this
place
of

tuning
in
now
to

that
are

here
from
the
smell
of
salty
water
to

just
allow
your

to
be
rich

either

I

go
of

messages
that
you

to
gently
scan
the

releasing
any
constrictions
you

across
perhaps
in
the
belly
the
shoulders
your
neck

into
this
position

more
highly
aware
of
the
physical
world
that
holds

body
at
every
inch
of
skin
that
is
in
contact
with
the
surface
below

expand
your
awareness
by
noting
other
physical
sensations

way
clothing
or
blankets
feel
against
your
body
all
the
way
the
air
around
you
touches
your

whatever

is

movements
of
energy

way
of
this
life
force
observe
any
sensations
that
are

the
outer
and
inner
world
bringing
you
closer
to
a
sense
of
harmony
and

now
tune
in
once
again
to
the
surface
beneath

a
moment
that
there
are
sturdy
roots
beginning
to
grow
from
all
the
places
that
make
contact
with
the
earth
feel
these
roots
expanding
permeating
the
surface
beneath
you
and
then
slowly
breaking
through
the
rich
dense
soil
beneath
the
earth
's
surface
[

as
you
ground
yourself
into
the
physical
world
this
way
observe
yourself
being
nourished
by
the
nutrients
and
lifeforce
that
rise
through
these
roots
see
if
you
can
feel

roots
feeding
you

protecting

begin
to
feel
more
and
more
grounded
in
the
space

to
dissolve

still
supports

held
on
it
shift
your
attention
now
by
drawing
your
awareness
to
the
crown
of
your
head
feel
into
the
lightness
that
is
present
here
noticing
perhaps
a
white
or
golden
glow
occupying
the
space
where
your
mind
and
physical
body
meets
the
universe
[

open
your
awareness
to
the
invisible
universal
energies
that
permeate

golden
thread

to
disappear

out
of
the
dense
forest
ahead
of
you
you
notice
a
pathway
beginning
to
clear
as
if
beckoning
you
to
move
deeper
into
the
woods
you
feel
safe
and
secure
venturing
that
way
so
you
begin
to
tread
mindfully
down
the
path
notice
the
way
the
earth
feels
beneath
your
feet
and
the
way
the
forest
air
feel
was
your
lungs
just
ahead
of
you
along
the
path
you
notice
a
bright
white
figure
beginning
to
appear
it
is
somewhat
like
a
human
form
but
is
radiating
in
otherworldly
energy
[

deep
in
your
bones
you
know
that
this
is
your
first
spirit
guide
you
continue
to
move
towards
this
spirits
direction
feeling
drawn
to
whatever
messages
you
are
now
sensing
our
present
here
take
your
time
to
observe
this
figure
as
you
approach
what
energy
does
he
or
she
exude
what
might
he
or
she
have
to
share
[

finally
you
reach
your
spirit
guide
standing
just
before
him
or
her
you
gaze
into
one
another
's
eyes
and
through
them
your
guide
speaks
listen
closely
to
what
is
offered
here
without
searching
for
anything
simply
open
yourself
to
the
teachings
that
are
being
offered
open
your

as
divine
messages
filter
into
your

your
guide
extends
his
or

hand
to
you
and
you
reach
for
it
you
sense
there
is
another
figure
this
spirit
would
like
you
to
meet
and
so
together
you
move
further
into
the
woods
as
you
walk
you
are
infused
with
your
spirits
energy
becoming
more
empowered
and
inspired
with
each
step
that
you
take
together
see
if

feel
all
of
your
cells
coming
to
life
awakening
to
the
truths
that
are
being
offered
to
you
[

and
once
again
you
notice
another
beaming
figure
of
light
just
ahead
of
you
on
this
path
take
your
time
as
you
slowly
move
your
way
towards
it
observing
whatever
energies
or
characteristics
are
noticeable
as
you
approach
[
Music

as
you
look
into
the
eyes
of
this
second
spirit
guide
you
feel
a
great
sense
of
peace
and
calm
come
over
you
this
spirit
like
the
first
speaks
at
a
higher
frequency
than
the
earthly
realm
is
accustomed
to
blessing
you
with
this
new
inside
take
a
few
moments
to
rest
with
this
spirit
allowing
the
messages
he
or
she
offers
to
permeate
your
entire
being
[
Music

now
with
each
of
these
mystical
spirits
on
either
side
of
you
you
know
that
there
is
one
final
guide
you
are
meant
to
meet
on
this
journey
the
three
of
you
continue
walking
slowly
and
mindfully
through
the
dense
and
enchanted
woods
that
surround
you
continue
to
breathe
in
the
fresh
forest
air
allowing
it
to
reach
all
the
way
to
the
depths
of
your
belly
tune
in
once
again
to
the
textures
and
colors
of
the
woods
mindfully
observing
all
the
mystical
creatures
and
plants
that
bring
everlasting
life
to
this
place
[
Music

finally
in
the
clearing
ahead
of
you
you
see
the
third
and
final
figure
of
light
the
spirit
is
glowing
with
arms
stretched
forward
warmly
you
make
your
way
towards
this
spirit
feeling
instantly
renewed
awakened
and
welcomed
and
as
you
finally
meet
this
divine
body
of
energy
you
reach
your
hands
forward
to
meet
theirs
as
you
look
into
this
third
spirits
eyes
you
are
instantly
filled
with
light
peace
love
and
clarity
take
a
few
moments
to
bathe
in
this
experience
allowing
the
highest
message
to
come
to
you
open
your
heart
to
whatever
it
is
you
need
to
hear
right
here
right
now
[

[

[

[

[

in
this
clearing
within
the
woods
you
and
your
three
spirit
guides
come
to
form
a
circle
hand
in
hand
take
a
moment
to
look
towards
the
first
who
came
to
you
sinking
more
deeply
into
the
message
he
or
she
had
offered
you
[
Music

[
Music

now
shift
your
gaze
to
the
second
spirit
you
met
remembering
the
bits
of
insights
that
were
infused
into
your
being
upon
your
encounter
[
Music
]
and
finally
gaze
into
the
eyes
of
the
third
and
final
spirit
opening
your
heart
to
whatever
was
presented
to
you
allow
this
final
message
to
mingle
for
a
few
moments
with
your
entire
being
[
Music
]
take
a
moment
to
thank
each
of
your
spirit
guides
and
then
gently
allow
them
to
dissipate
back
into
the
air
of
these
enchanted
woods
know
that
they
have
not
left
you
but
they
are
always
always
within
[
Music
]
gently
allow
the
entire
forest
to
melt
away
as
you
draw
your
awareness
back
to
your
physical
body
[
Music
]
notice
once
again
the
feeling
of
the
bed
or
other
support
system
beneath
you
and
then
reconnect
with
your
breath
to
help
ground
you
back
into
this
physical
reality
nestled
into
the
cushions
and
blankets
that
are
there
around
you
allowing
them
to
bring
warmth
to
body
and
spirit
[
Music
]
the
messages
that
were
offered
may
continue
to
linger
for
a
short
time
but
soon
I
invite
you
to
surrender
them
back
to
the
universe
for
the
night
knowing
that
they
are
never
very
far
away
let
all
thoughts
go
as
you
come
back
down
to
this
very
moment
in
time
there
is
nothing
you
need
to
witness
in
this
moment
aside
from
your
body
as
it
slowly
surrenders
into
sleep
the
positive
and
powerful
insights
you
have
encountered
will
return
tomorrow
but
for
now
allow
the
body
heart
mind
and
solve
the
risk
deeply
into
the
physical
world
with
your
spirit
guides
always
around
you
you
can
rest
with
ease
knowing
that
you
are
supported
unconditionally
throughout
this
lifetime
allow
the
following
affirmation
to
lull
you
to
sleep
repeating
these
words
silently
and
softly
as
you
inch
closer
and
closer
towards
a
restorative
slumber
the
universe
supports
me
the
universe
supports
me
the
universe
supports
me

hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
thank
you
for
tuning
into
this
meditation
this
meditation
comes
at
a
time
an
exceptionally
challenging
time
for
us
here
in
Australia
as
the
wildfires
have
sparked
overwhelming
devastation
fear
uncertainty
grief
and
despair
with
a
situation
as
destructive
as
this
one
right
before
our
very
eyes
it
's
hard
to
find
a
sense
of
peace
safety
and
security
in
the
earth
beneath
our
feet
even
those
who
have
seen
the
images
footages
and
news
from
afar
can
sense
a
great
loss
that
is
occurring
in
this
beautiful
country
humans
pets
plants
animals
property
nothing
is
beyond
the
reach
of
these
fires
so
wherever
you
are
in
the
world
I
hope
this
meditation
brings
some
sense
of
peace
comfort
as
we
move
forward
to
get
started
I
invite
you
to
take
a
moment
just
to
settle
into
this
space
either
lying
down
or
in
a
comfortable
seated
position
and
allow
your
belly
to
relax
and
the
forit
to
soften
as
you
simply
arrive
wherever
you
are
my
hopes
are
that
you
are
far
from
danger
in
this
moment
and
then
you
can
find
some
sense
of
solidity
in
the
earth
beneath
you
right
now
so
draw
your
attention
to
the
breath
and
watching
it
as
it
flows
into
and
out
of
your
body
[
Music
]
and
then
see
if
you
might
invite
the
breath
a
little
bit
deeper
relaxing
your
stomach
as
you
welcome
both
body
and
mind
to
soften
here
[
Music
]
now
take
a
few
moments
to
be
mindful
of
any
thoughts
or
any
feelings
any
stories
that
are
moving
through
your
mind
in
this
moment
if
you
've
been
touched
by
fires
in
some
way
in
Australia
or
any
part
of
the
world
take
a
moment
to
honor
whatever
feelings
and
sensations
are
present
for
you
and
if
you
are
somewhere
else
across
the
ocean
and
have
been
shaken
by
what
you
've
seen
in
the
media
or
heard
from
loved
ones
take
a
moment
to
also
honor
whatever
has
arisen
within
this
meditation
is
not
designed
to
make
everything
okay
it
is
first
meant
to
assist
us
in
honoring
the
raw
truth
of
our
experience
before
guiding
us
into
some
sense
of
peace
despite
this
tragic
event
now
finish
your
next
exhalation
and
then
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
out
a
deep
breath
in
once
again
and
out
and
one
more
time
while
it
's
important
to
witness
and
honor
whatever
is
within
us
we
can
continually
bring
ourselves
back
to
the
peace
and
safety
of
this
present
moment
through
awareness
of
the
breath
use
the
breath
as
your
anchor
anytime
you
need
to
reconnect
with
what
is
right
here
the
fear
and
uncertainty
of
approaching
fires
the
loss
of
homes
of
wildlife
and
animals
a
sense
of
hopelessness
helplessness
and
disempowerment
and
the
grief
the
anger
the
shock
the
desperation
all
of
these
are
very
real
experiences
that
a
meditation
can
not
make
right
in
any
tangible
sense
the
very
raw
and
heart-wrenching
feelings
that
have
been
stirred
are
so
deeply
human
the
devastation
is
hard
to
put
into
words
[
Music
]
and
so
because
of
what
is
happening
here
and
in
other
areas
of
the
world
we
might
feel
as
if
someone
or
something
is
to
blame
now
whether
that
be
climate
change
politicians
or
humanity
as
a
whole
being
able
to
point
out
a
cause
for
this
devastation
can
in
some
way
feel
consoling
and
yet
anger
blame
and
rage
will
not
help
us
to
find
peace
healing
and
a
way
for
us
to
move
forward
and
when
we
dig
deeper
we
might
tap
into
what
is
beneath
our
anger
is
there
a
sense
of
fear
juda
feeling
unsupported
unprotected
or
vulnerable
is
there
a
sense
of
despair
for
the
suffering
of
animals
wildlife
and
humanity
[
Music
]
whatever
is
moving
through
you
I
invite
you
to
tune
in
to
what
is
present
in
the
body
and
can
you
observe
and
sit
with
these
emotions
as
they
manifest
themselves
in
your
physical
being
[
Music
]
you
might
want
to
breathe
energy
into
these
areas
of
tightness
tension
or
resistance
naturally
letting
yourself
soften
into
this
meditation
[
Music
]
grounding
through
the
breath
little
thoughts
and
stories
come
as
they
may
and
and
watch
them
depart
just
as
effortlessly
with
each
out
breath
this
might
take
some
time
so
just
practice
compassion
as
these
things
work
themselves
through
[
Music
]
to
explore
this
soft
and
compassionate
witnessing
I
invite
you
to
create
a
bit
of
distance
between
your
thoughts
and
feelings
and
yourself
as
the
observer
of
them
see
if
you
might
approach
your
fears
and
concerns
from
a
place
of
your
highest
itself
as
you
watch
what
moves
through
consider
can
i
nurture
this
part
of
me
this
part
of
the
world
that
is
suffering
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
open
your
heart
to
yourself
holding
yourself
exactly
as
you
are
in
this
moment
and
as
we
open
up
through
this
center
of
our
being
we
can
begin
to
find
a
greater
sense
of
peace
even
amidst
the
heaviness
that
life
can
bring
[
Music
]
continue
to
breathe
all
the
way
into
the
base
of
the
belly
and
all
the
way
back
out
releasing
just
a
fraction
of
discomfort
resistance
and
any
strong
emotions
with
each
and
every
breath
[
Music
]
now
begin
to
imagine
a
white
healing
light
penetrating
from
the
top
of
your
head
inching
ever
so
slowly
down
through
the
body
with
every
body
part
that
it
passes
feel
your
body
gently
opening
up
to
a
deeper
release
in
a
sense
of
bees
[
Music
]
allow
the
mind
to
soften
beneath
its
glow
your
heart
to
expand
and
your
belly
to
relax
and
your
limbs
to
find
softness
and
stillness
while
there
may
be
residue
of
emotion
and
fear
see
if
you
can
open
yourself
up
to
this
moment
of
peace
stillness
and
subtle
healing
can
you
allow
yourself
to
be
bathed
in
this
white
healing
glow
but
these
next
few
moments
and
now
from
this
lighter
softer
space
see
if
you
might
open
your
heart
as
you
bring
to
mind
the
land
the
humans
and
the
animals
that
are
in
need
of
your
love
and
your
prayers
at
this
time
you
might
envision
strangers
or
perhaps
someone
you
know
and
love
you
might
envision
farmland
forests
plants
and
animals
or
rows
of
homes
you
might
envision
the
whole
country
or
the
whole
world
[
Music
]
regardless
of
what
comes
to
mind
allow
the
images
of
these
Souls
to
enter
your
mind
from
a
place
of
love
rather
than
fear
hold
the
image
of
them
in
both
mind
and
heart
and
sending
love
light
and
peace
to
all
those
affected
[
Music
]
as
we
allow
our
strongest
emotions
to
come
to
pass
and
to
soften
opening
up
to
our
reality
from
a
place
of
purpose
and
love
we
start
to
uncover
ways
we
might
be
of
benefit
to
ourselves
to
our
loved
ones
our
community
and
our
shared
humanity
from
sending
prayers
to
sending
support
and
supplies
to
helping
in
hands-on
ways
where
possible
let
these
devastating
fires
bring
our
shared
humanity
to
the
forefront
encouraging
us
to
love
support
and
send
peace
to
all
those
on
this
planet
take
a
few
moments
of
quiet
space
now
to
send
prayers
or
loving
thoughts
to
all
those
affected
by
these
fires
and
to
those
affected
by
any
other
disaster
that
is
shaking
this
world
and
those
who
call
it
home
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
gently
soften
your
mind
of
all
thoughts
or
prayers
and
all
best
wishes
as
you
come
back
to
the
natural
rhythm
of
the
breath
allow
each
inhalation
to
open
your
heart
to
the
love
and
healing
that
is
possible
and
each
exhalation
free
you
of
things
that
no
longer
serve
you
so
that
you
may
move
through
this
world
with
hope
and
purpose
and
love
whatever
comes
your
way
I
send
you
my
prayers
and
warmest
of
wishes
allow
the
waves
of
life
to
move
through
you
but
to
never
hold
you
down
for

hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
guided
nighttime
meditation
that
is
aimed
to
help
you
wind
down
both
body
and
mind
before
sleep
often
times
we
get
into
bed
with
our
heart
set
on
getting
a
great
night
's
sleep
an
overactive
body
or
mind
or
both
stand
in
the
way
of
our
achieving
this
deep
relaxation
that
we
yearned
for
so
to
address
this
challenge
this
meditation
will
help
you
to
soften
all
of
that
interactivity
and
tension
as
you
find
yourself
drifting
naturally
and
gracefully
into
a
sound
sleep
so
before
we
begin
I
invite
you
to
take
a
moment
or
two
to
ensure
that
all
of
your
end-of-day
activities
are
taken
care
of
lights
turned
off
alarms
set
if
needed
and
anything
else
that
might
stand
in
the
way
of
your
fullest
relaxation
you
can
address
this
[
Music
]
and
once
everything
is
taken
care
of
just
getting
comfortable
in
your
sleeping
or
lying
down
position
your
neck
should
be
aligned
with
the
spine
and
your
arms
and
legs
are
free
to
fall
and
rest
where
they
may
and
take
a
deep
breath
in
now
and
out
and
allowing
yourself
to
surrender
a
little
bit
into
the
surface
beneath
you
take
a
moment
here
to
simply
acknowledge
the
present
state
of
your
mind
[
Music
]
without
judging
or
evaluating
or
trying
to
change
anything
see
if
you
might
observe
whatever
thoughts
or
feelings
are
present
from
a
place
of
subtle
separation
[
Music
]
it
does
n't
need
to
be
any
attachment
to
whatever
you
were
witnessing
just
a
soft
and
compassionate
acknowledgement
of
your
present
state
of
being
[
Music
]
now
softly
surrender
is
focused
awareness
as
you
shift
your
attention
to
the
natural
rhythm
of
your
breath
[
Music
]
see
if
you
can
follow
each
inhalation
and
exhalation
and
mindfully
observing
whatever
sensations
are
present
you
might
notice
the
depth
of
your
breath
and
its
speed
or
rhythm
[
Music
]
but
in
any
case
see
if
you
can
accept
your
current
state
of
being
without
trying
to
change
it
in
any
way
[
Music
]
and
as
you
observe
your
breath
you
might
notice
it
beginning
to
deepen
and
quite
often
when
we
draw
our
attention
in
a
loving
and
non-judgmental
way
to
the
breath
it
begins
to
expand
on
its
own
you
might
observe
the
belly
softening
or
the
shoulders
falling
whatever
your
experience
feels
like
is
entirely
welcome
[
Music
]
whether
we
are
consciously
aware
of
it
or
not
our
body
and
mind
is
connected
so
when
there
is
tension
in
either
body
or
mind
it
often
impacts
the
well-being
of
the
other
aspect
of
ourselves
sometimes
we
're
not
entirely
aware
of
the
tension
we
hold
on
to
until
we
start
to
consciously
release
it
so
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
we
're
going
to
move
through
a
gentle
though
powerful
practice
of
tension
and
release
as
you
hear
each
body
part
mentioned
I
invite
you
to
bring
attention
or
tightness
to
this
region
and
then
to
release
it
completely
on
your
following
breath
out
so
to
begin
draw
your
attention
down
to
your
feet
on
your
next
in-breath
curling
them
in
and
holding
them
tightly
for
a
brief
moment
and
on
your
next
exhalation
release
this
tension
completely
[
Music
]
breathe
slowly
and
mindfully
in
between
body
parts
noticing
the
wave
of
relaxation
that
pervades
the
mind
as
we
move
through
this
practice
now
bring
a
tightness
to
both
legs
pulling
them
in
and
holding
them
just
for
a
moment
and
release
them
on
the
exhalation
perhaps
relaxing
more
thoroughly
through
a
deep
sigh
[
Music
]
on
your
next
breath
in
contract
the
space
within
your
pelvis
region
and
your
backside
holding
for
just
a
brief
moment
and
then
soften
these
areas
on
your
exhalation
and
melting
further
into
the
surface
that
support
you
[
Music
]
shifting
your
focus
now
up
to
your
belly
tightening
your
core
muscles
on
your
next
inhalation
Titan
and
as
you
exhale
allow
all
the
muscles
here
to
relax
completely
feel
a
complete
surrender
in
your
core
taking
a
few
slow
deep
breaths
into
your
belly
now
[
Music
]
draw
your
attention
now
to
your
hands
tightening
them
into
fists
on
your
next
inhalation
tighten
and
as
you
exhale
allow
your
fingers
and
palms
to
soften
completely
[
Music
]
on
your
next
inhalation
pull
your
arms
into
your
sides
squeezing
and
holding
for
just
a
moment
and
as
you
exhale
allow
them
to
surrender
completely
to
gravity
[
Music
]
bring
a
subtle
and
inward
pull
to
your
shoulders
and
upper
chest
area
on
your
next
inhalation
and
tighten
and
relax
these
areas
completely
allowing
the
shoulders
to
fall
back
and
the
hard
area
to
soften
and
expand
[
Music
]
now
I
invite
you
to
focus
on
the
muscles
in
your
face
tightening
your
jaw
your
cheeks
your
forehead
but
just
a
moment
really
tense
really
tighten
and
as
you
exhale
allow
all
face
muscles
to
soften
completely
let
go
[
Music
]
lastly
I
invite
you
to
tense
your
entire
body
or
any
particular
region
that
you
feel
requires
further
release
and
hold
here
for
just
a
moment
as
you
observe
the
sensation
of
tension
here
on
your
next
outward
breath
let
the
entire
physical
body
go
letting
gravity
nourish
you
as
it
holds
you
safely
and
comfortably
on
the
bed
or
other
service
that
supports
you
here
[
Music
]
just
take
a
few
moments
of
silence
here
to
ground
yourself
through
the
breath
once
again
subtly
observing
the
underlying
restful
state
of
both
body
and
mind
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
if
it
feels
more
comfortable
to
sink
into
sleep
in
a
different
position
you
're
welcome
to
shift
your
posture
at
any
time
and
if
or
as
you
move
positions
just
move
slowly
and
mindfully
embodying
this
peaceful
state
of
being
that
you
have
transitioned
into
[
Music
]
if
any
thoughts
arise
in
the
forefront
of
your
mind
attempting
to
pull
you
away
from
this
inner
peace
continue
observing
these
invisible
movements
of
energy
by
silently
whispering
to
yourself
I
see
you
and
I
release
you
I
see
you
and
I
release
you
I
see
you
and
I
release
you
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
now
allowing
all
thoughts
to
be
gently
surrendered
as
they
arise
see
if
he
can
tune
into
the
blank
canvas
that
exists
before
the
mind
's
eye
and
in
this
space
begin
to
visualize
yourself
standing
at
the
edge
of
a
majestic
lake
the
ancient
pines
that
surround
the
shore
the
clouds
that
fill
the
sky
and
the
subtle
stars
that
begin
to
appear
overhead
as
the
night
approaches
[
Music
]
each
of
these
elements
adds
to
the
wonder
of
this
space
you
are
witnessing
[
Music
]
the
waters
are
calm
and
clear
mirroring
the
pink
orange
and
fading
blue
sky
above
[
Music
]
you
feel
equally
peaceful
silently
whispering
the
beauty
and
radiance
of
this
simple
moment
[
Music
]
you
stand
firmly
grounded
on
a
rocky
peninsula
that
slopes
gently
towards
the
water
barefoot
you
feel
into
the
cool
rock
beneath
you
kneeling
deeply
connected
to
and
supported
by
the
physical
earth
this
connection
you
now
hold
with
nature
inspires
you
to
seek
more
of
this
natural
comfort
in
your
waking
life
to
return
to
this
natural
place
whenever
you
seek
clarity
peace
or
release
just
to
your
right
a
narrow
dark
extends
from
the
shore
at
the
end
of
it
a
floating
raft
gently
bobbles
atop
the
still
water
[
Music
]
as
the
Sun
sets
we
begin
to
feel
tired
hoping
to
drift
off
beneath
the
stars
that
grow
brighter
and
brighter
as
the
sky
darkens
so
you
begin
to
slowly
and
mindfully
make
your
way
down
the
dock
soon
coming
to
reach
the
raft
that
floats
at
the
end
of
it
[
Music
]
upon
reaching
the
raft
you
notice
that
there
are
already
cushions
and
blankets
set
up
for
you
making
yourself
comfortable
you
come
to
rest
here
lying
down
gently
beneath
the
stars
overhead
a
gentle
lapping
of
water
beneath
the
raft
lulls
you
closer
and
closer
toward
sleep
[
Music
]
as
you
listen
to
it
the
mind
begins
to
fall
away
and
your
inner
peace
rises
to
the
surface
[
Music
]
before
drifting
off
however
you
take
one
long
last
look
up
towards
the
cosmos
witnessing
the
stars
here
surrounded
by
the
beauty
and
peace
of
this
natural
landscape
it
is
enough
to
melt
all
worries
and
fears
away
[
Music
]
all
tensions
are
released
from
both
body
and
mind
as
you
develop
a
deep
trust
in
the
grander
vision
of
life
the
Stars
offer
you
this
heightened
perspective
[
Music
]
you
close
your
eyes
on
even
the
stars
now
tuning
into
the
sound
and
sensations
observed
here
the
water
continues
to
lap
beneath
the
raft
and
the
subtle
rocking
makes
you
feel
deeply
connected
to
the
water
beneath
you
to
the
flow
of
life
itself
and
to
this
unique
and
wonderful
journey
you
are
honored
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
you
return
to
your
breath
now
witnessing
the
natural
ebb
and
flow
of
this
life
force
as
it
passes
through
your
physical
being
[
Music
]
on
your
next
in
breath
just
allow
the
heart
and
belly
to
expand
completely
and
as
you
breathe
out
release
any
last
traces
of
tension
perhaps
with
a
deep
sigh
to
help
you
settle
[
Music
]
now
gently
allow
the
notion
of
this
majestic
lake
to
dissipate
as
you
tune
into
your
physical
presence
wherever
you
are
notice
the
comfort
and
support
of
the
surface
beneath
you
the
nourishment
of
the
breath
as
it
flows
through
you
and
the
piece
that
is
observable
beneath
the
layers
of
your
mind
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
with
nothing
left
to
envision
and
nothing
left
to
do
you
are
ready
to
let
the
day
come
to
an
end
so
that
another
may
arrive
when
you
were
well-rested
letting
everything
go
gently
allow
yourself
to
drift
into
a
deep
and
steady
slumber
as
you
fall
to
sleep
allow
the
following
affirmations
to
fill
your
subconscious
mind
continuing
to
transform
the
inner
world
in
positive
and
empowering
ways
[

I
am
safe
grounded

youhello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
soothing
guided
meditation
that
will
take
you
on
a
journey
into
the
peace
of
the
ocean
gently
guiding
you
towards
a
restorative
and
peaceful
sleep
during
the
course
of
this
journey
you
will
first
come
into
contact
with
the
peace
that
exists
right
here
in
the
present
moment
before
being
guided
to
open
yourself
up
to
a
deeper
descent
underwater
all
that
is
required
of
you
now
is
a
willingness
to
open
yourself
up
to
the
possibility
of
complete
inner
harmony
take
a
few
grounding
breaths
now
as
we
begin
this
exploration
allowing
your
heart
and
chest
to
soften
with
each
breath
that
you
take
[
Music
]
now
take
a
few
moments
to
make
any
necessary
adjustments
to
the
physical
body
moving
yourself
in
such
a
way
to
allow
relaxation
to
flow
effortlessly
through
your
being
if
there
is
any
tightness
lingering
around
the
chest
or
the
stomach
or
your
shoulders
or
any
other
part
of
your
body
quietly
make
note
of
this
tension
and
then
gently
release
it
on
the
next
breath
out
[
Music
]
straighten
your
neck
soften
the
area
around
your
eyes
as
you
consciously
begin
to
release
all
physical
tension
you
prepare
yourself
for
the
journey
into
deep
release
and
peace
[
Music
]
now
before
we
journey
anywhere
let's
take
some
time
to
become
more
intimately
aware
of
the
environment
around
and
within
us
begin
by
simply
drawing
your
awareness
to
the
physical
body
and
each
area
of
it
that
is
in
contact
with
the
physical
support
beneath
you
you
might
notice
the
entire
back
side
of
your
body
being
completely
supported
by
the
bed
or
the
cushions
or
the
blankets
underneath
you
just
take
a
moment
to
simply
draw
your
attention
to
each
area
of
contact
here
now
consider
areas
of
the
body
facing
upwards
towards
the
ceiling
that
are
also
in
contact
with
the
material
world
noticing
items
of
comfort
that
might
be
draped
over
the
top
of
you
and
then
see
if
you
can
finally
tuned
in
to
the
invisibility
of
air
that
surrounds
your
body
noticing
if
you
can
feel
it
against
your
skin
in
these
observations
there
is
no
need
to
search
for
some
specific
form
of
experience
or
result
simply
allow
any
arisings
to
be
witnessed
[
Music
]
draw
your
attention
now
to
the
belly
as
you
observe
the
way
it
rises
and
falls
as
you
inhale
and
exhale
[
Music
]
even
if
sensations
of
the
breath
within
a
more
subtle
we
can
typically
observe
their
presence
in
the
form
of
movement
once
we
draw
our
attention
to
this
life
force
so
allow
the
rest
of
the
body
to
remain
still
as
you
focus
for
a
few
silent
moments
on
the
rising
and
falling
of
your
core
use
your
breath
as
an
anchor
when
needed
throughout
this
meditation
even
when
you
descend
into
the
depths
of
the
ocean
in
this
visualization
the
breath
is
always
available
to
provide
you
with
grounding
support
and
connection
to
this
physical
existence
and
if
at
any
point
the
mind
wanders
becoming
preoccupied
with
stories
fears
or
judgments
or
chatter
of
any
sort
you
can
once
again
turn
to
the
breath
or
to
my
words
to
refocus
your
attention
it
's
entirely
natural
for
our
minds
to
wander
so
there
is
no
need
to
condemn
this
tendency
in
any
way
when
distractions
occur
simply
take
a
deep
breath
refocus
your
attention
and
settle
into
this
act
of
self-care
once
again
as
you
watched
the
breath
moving
into
and
out
of
your
body
allow
a
sense
of
tranquility
to
overcome
your
entire
being
of
seemingly
paradoxical
the
breath
is
both
like
an
anchor
and
like
the
waves
they
are
one
in
the
same
as
we
learn
to
ride
the
waves
of
breath
and
of
life
we
move
towards
the
discovery
of
complete
presence
and
stillness
no
matter
how
still
we
bring
ourselves
to
be
waves
will
still
come
just
as
the
breath
will
still
come
movement
is
a
part
of
life
how
we
react
to
those
movements
is
where
we
discover
our
power
to
maneuver
ourselves
in
this
world
peacefully
and
calmly
so
before
we
descend
into
the
ocean
take
a
few
moments
of
silence
to
effortlessly
move
with
the
rhythm
of
your
breath
the
body
will
remain
still
while
the
present
moment
continually
shifts
sink
into
this
peaceful
movement
for
a
short
while
now
[
Music
]
take
this
moment
to
tune
into
the
space
between
the
brows
into
the
Mayans
I
allow
all
thoughts
and
images
to
melt
away
as
you
focus
your
attention
solely
on
the
empty
space
before
you
the
world
around
and
within
becomes
quiet
as
you
prepare
for
a
journey
into
the
depths
of
the
ocean
upon
this
blank
slate
before
your
mind
's
eye
begin
to
visualize
yourself
at
the
edge
of
the
ocean
your
bare
feet
are
nestled
into
the
sand
as
you
stare
out
the
vast
sea
before
you
take
a
few
moments
to
observe
the
sensations
present
what
do
your
eyes
notice
you
what
sounds
to
your
ears
pickup
what
smells
fill
the
air
how
does
your
body
feel
how
does
your
heart
feel
as
you
begin
to
relax
into
this
space
eel
the
ocean
air
filling
the
entire
cavity
of
your
lungs
as
you
inhale
and
then
releasing
all
unnecessary
stress
and
tension
from
your
physical
body
as
you
exhale
stare
out
at
the
open
sea
as
you
witness
every
knot
and
contraction
dissolving
[
Music
]
you
take
a
few
steps
forward
so
that
as
the
waves
brush
up
against
the
shore
they
cover
your
feet
observe
the
natural
rhythm
of
the
waves
steady
though
ever-changing
just
like
the
breath
they
continue
to
flow
in
and
out
in
and
out
the
ocean
slowly
becomes
influenced
by
your
breaths
natural
rhythm
slowly
coming
to
meet
your
own
unique
flow
you
start
to
feel
yourself
to
be
in
total
harmony
with
the
vast
abyss
in
front
of
you
something
inside
of
you
whispers
view
to
venture
into
the
water
so
you
start
to
move
slowly
and
gracefully
forward
step
by
step
you
wade
out
until
soon
your
calves
are
submerged
and
then
your
knees
your
thighs
and
your
waist
you
stand
waist-deep
as
you
prepare
to
dive
below
[
Music
]
stretching
your
arms
out
before
you
you
take
a
deep
breath
a
small
jump
and
then
dive
forward
with
grace
and
these
you
are
now
completely
submerged
as
you
glide
through
the
water
extending
both
arm
fords
and
then
swooping
them
out
to
the
sides
to
propel
you
further
you
notice
that
by
divine
magic
you
are
able
to
breathe
beneath
the
water
small
gills
have
developed
and
you
come
to
realize
that
you
are
neither
of
this
world
nor
the
human
one
you
are
otherworldly
a
great
wave
of
relief
washes
over
you
as
you
realize
you
had
been
yearning
to
explore
this
underwater
palace
with
ease
you
continue
to
breast
to
stroke
your
way
through
the
ocean
feeling
completely
safe
and
accepted
within
this
new
kingdom
[
Music
]
you
absorb
every
new
side
every
color
texture
and
shape
of
the
sea
life
you
pass
[
Music
]
seahorses
brightly
striped
fish
and
even
small
shark
swim
around
you
none
of
them
posing
any
threat
to
you
in
this
magical
environment
you
breathe
naturally
and
effortlessly
underwater
your
body
feels
light
and
free
completely
supported
with
each
and
every
movement
you
make
with
every
drop
of
water
that
soon
passes
over
your
body
old
stories
and
detachments
are
released
soon
nothing
remains
but
a
sense
of
oneness
you
are
aligned
with
the
oceans
movements
gliding
with
grace
now
something
appears
to
be
approaching
you
from
straight
ahead
though
you
can
not
make
out
what
the
creature
is
your
intuition
tells
you
it
is
not
threatening
the
pair
of
eyes
move
closer
and
closer
until
very
soon
you
know
the
figure
to
be
a
dolphin
that
is
making
its
way
toward
you
the
dolphin
slows
as
she
approaches
stilling
herself
just
a
few
feet
ahead
of
you
you
too
have
ceased
movement
now
floating
effortlessly
in
the
open
abyss
of
the
great
sea
both
pairs
of
eyes
meet
as
you
take
a
few
silent
moments
of
pure
awareness
here
you
can
sense
that
your
energies
are
in
harmony
and
that
you
have
attracted
one
another
for
a
reason
[
Music
]
though
the
dolphin
speaks
a
different
language
in
sound
the
vibrations
relay
her
message
she
reminds
you
that
it
is
possible
to
be
both
compassionate
and
gentle
while
harnessing
a
deep
and
authentic
source
of
inner
strength
when
embodying
these
two
principles
the
way
dolphins
do
body
and
mind
relax
completely
knowing
that
the
paradoxes
in
life
do
not
have
to
bring
strife
strength
and
compassion
can
co-exist
they
can
be
one
in
the
same
the
dolphin
breaks
her
gaze
as
she
swims
off
to
the
side
and
begins
to
swim
playful
circles
around
you
she
sings
out
to
the
sea
reminding
you
that
it
is
okay
to
lighten
up
to
play
and
to
be
who
you
really
are
as
she
sings
you
feel
her
vibrations
radiating
into
the
core
of
your
being
in
this
moment
you
know
you
are
forever
changed
for
the
better
balance
and
harmony
have
now
made
their
way
into
your
burns
rather
than
remaining
an
idea
digested
by
mind
alone
[
Music
]
the
dolphin
slows
and
comes
back
for
one
more
brief
moment
to
gaze
into
your
eyes
a
subtle
smile
overcomes
her
face
before
she
flutters
away
disappearing
into
the
darkness
ahead
of
you
you
breathe
deeply
feeling
her
still
very
much
present
within
you
[
Music

she
has
blessed
you
with
a
wisdom
and
the
gifts
gifts
that
now
live
within
you
you
look
above
and
notice
you
are
not
too
far
from
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
sunlight
trickles
in
to
remind
you
to
come
back
to
the
human
world
though
you
have
enjoyed
your
time
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
you
know
you
must
now
return
as
you
swim
slowly
and
calmly
up
towards
the
light
you
feel
every
last
grain
of
tension
fall
from
your
body
sinking
down
to
the
ocean
floor
to
be
renewed
you
feel
light
and
free
having
no
remaining
weightiness
in
your
body
or
mind
as
you
break
through
the
barrier
of
water
that
opens
up
to
the
open
sky
your
gills
disappear
and
you
notice
what
it
is
like
to
breathe
like
a
human
once
again
floating
on
your
back

take
a
few
deep
breaths
into

and
strength

welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
which
is
designed
to
help
you
slow
your
racing
mind
and
then
lead
you
gently
into
a
soothing
and
restorative
sleep
over
the
next
little
while
I
invite
you
to
simply
follow
my
voice
as
you
come
to
experience
a
profound
sense
of
silence
within
take
a
few
deep
breaths
now
to
settle
yourself
into
this
space
and
soon
and
we
will
begin
it
is
not
uncommon
within
our
fast-paced
modern
lifestyle
for
the
mine
to
be
on
constant
overdrive
even
when
we
bring
the
body
to
rest
mental
chatter
often
persists
one
of
the
primary
reasons
that
we
have
trouble
easing
our
way
into
sleep
is
because
of
this
feverish
side
of
the
mind
whether
it
is
caught
up
in
the
past
events
or
is
living
20
steps
into
the
future
the
mind
has
a
way
of
pulling
us
out
of
the
present
moment
it
keeps
us
stimulated
and
engaged
even
when
we
want
to
try
to
slow
down
when
the
mind
is
constantly
on
the
go
deep
rest
is
put
on
hold
before
we
begin
navigating
this
side
of
the
mind
exposing
it
in
such
a
way
that
calms
and
soothes
it
let
us
take
a
few
moments
to
come
into
a
comfortable
lying
down
position
and
just
taking
your
time
to
stretch
and
release
the
body
in
any
way
that
feels
restorative
and
to
adjust
your
positioning
with
cushions
or
blankets
as
you
require
and
once
you
are
settled
see
if
it
is
possible
to
straighten
the
neck
if
it
is
curved
at
all
bringing
a
gentle
oneness
across
the
chest
breathing
in
and
exhaling
[

grounding
yourself
into
the
physical
space
beneath
and
around
you
so
take
some
time
now
to
really
connect
with
your
breath
becoming
intimate
with
the
way
it
passes
through
you
as
you
inhale
observe
every
sensation
as
the
air
trickles
in
first
entering
your
nasal
cavity
passing
through
the
trachea
and
then
settling
into
the
depths
of
your
lungs
and
as
you
breathe
out
observe
the
moment
in
Reverse
as
your
breath
returns
to
the
world
around
you
notice
your
breaths
rhythm
and
depth
[

without
changing
it
in
any
way
for
the
time
being
simply
observe
its
flow
noticing
where
it
extends
to
and
how
fast
or
slow
it
moves
as
we
move
through
this
meditation
remember
that
your
breath
is
always
available
to
help
anchor
you
in
this
present
moment
if
distracting
thoughts
arise
which
they
will
allow
the
breath
to
guide
you
back
down
to
your
body
to
your
direct
experience
of
the
now
[
Music

take
a
moment
now
to
simply
draw
your
attention
to
your
stomach
notice
the
way
the
belly
moves
as
you
breathe
rising
and
falling
throughout
the
cycle
of
your
breath
as
you
draw
your
attention
to
this
area
of
the
body
you
might
notice
that
the
breath
naturally
deepens
if
so
open
yourself
to
this

release
any
constriction
in
the
abdomen
to
help
guide
the
flow
of

deep
into

when
how
Mayans
run
uncontrollably
our
bodies
assume
a
state
of
stress
engaging
a
defense
mechanism
known
as
the
fight-or-flight
response
when
the
body
is
engaged
in
this
way

as
the
body
prepares
to
defend
itself
in
order
to
counterbalance
this
surge
of
stress
hormones
and
to
soften
the
reaction
within
the
body
we
can
engage
in
what
is
known
as
the
relaxation
response
to
help
the
body
and
mind
to
slow
down
by
consciously
drawing
the
breath
into
the
belly

invite
this
counter
response
to
take
over

that
stimulate

take
a
few
moments
of
silence
now
to
deepen
the
breath
in
this
way
guiding
it
into
the
fullest
capacity
of
the
lungs
so
that
it
presses
into
the
abdomen
if
you
find
it
challenging
at
first
to
deepen
your
breath
all
the
way
this
is
entirely
okay
over
time
the
breath
will
soften
and
the
lungs
will
expand
for
now
just
see
how
far
the
breath
is
capable
of
going
as
you
slowly
breathe
in
and
slowly
breathe
out

thoughts
may
continue
to
rise
from
time
to
time
but
there
is
no
need
to
panic
or
self
judge
if
they
do
the
mind
may
attempt
to
add
fuel
to
the
fire
by
criticizing
telling
the
self
that
it
should
not
be
thinking
refrain
from
giving
in
to
this
common
reaction
reminding
yourself
that
is
natural
for
thoughts
to
arise
and
then
compassionately
releasing
whatever
has
come
up
[

[

thinking
is
a
natural
function
of
the
mind
and
as
such
it
can
not
be
forced
to
cease
entirely
however
we
can
begin
to
expose
our
racing
thoughts
by
observing
them
from
a
new
place
and
with
the
fresh
lens
as
we
uncover
their
nature
we
begin
to
distance
ourselves
from
them
and
from
the
stories
that
they
spin
so
now
I
invite
you
to
open
your
heart
to
the
truth
that
you
are
not
your
thoughts
take
a
few
breaths
here
on
your
own
repeating
the
following
words
in
silence
I
am
NOT
my
thoughts
I
am
NOT
my
thoughts
allow
yourself
to
open
wholeheartedly
to
the
truth
that
your
thoughts
do
not
define
you

notice
the
way
that
the
mind
can
be
redirected
in
such
a
way
flowing
alongside
your
attention
it
can
take
time
to
catch
the
mind
when
it
escapes
but
we
continued
practice
it
is
possible
to
refocus
again
and
again
on
the
direct
experience
within
this
present
moment
any
time
the
mind
wanders
simply
acknowledge
its
movement
with
compassion
and
curiosity
there
is
no
reason
to
criticize
or
condemn
the
uprising
of
thought
instead
practice
observing
the
inner
dialog
from
a
distance
when
you
notice
yourself
becoming
entangled
in
the
minds
story
simply
notice
what
has
happened
and
draw
your
attention
back
to
your
breath

follow
each
inhale

it
is
possible
to
further
de-escalate
the
power
of
your
thoughts
by
beginning
to
label
them
whenever
they
arise
this
sort
of
labeling
should
not
be
based
in
judgment
such
as
being
defined
by
words
such
as
good
or
bad
or
spiritual
or
an
spiritual
rather
rising
thoughts
can
be
observed
according
to
the
action
that
they
represent
for
instance
you
may
assign
certain
words
to
your
thoughts
such
as
thinking
planning
denying
criticizing
or
worrying
after
you
label
thoughts
in
this
way
allow
the
wave
to
disappear
and
then
return
to
your
breath
[

practice
this
again
rooting
yourself
through
the
breath
and
becoming
more
aware
of
the
nature
of
your
thoughts
not
of
their
content

the
way
they
move

the
nature
of
these

of

let
whole

subside
as
you
come
deeper
into
the
physical

of
the
body
take
a
moment
to
scan
the
body
gently
drawing
your
awareness
first
your

before
very
slowly
moving
upwards
throughout
the
visceral
body
and
as
you
pass
each
area
allow
that
part
of
the
body
to
soften
by
simply
focusing
on
a
particular
area
and
by
using
the
power
of
your
attention
to
release
all
of
the
associated
muscles
the
physical

relaxes

relaxes
even
further

up

feeling
free
of
your

relax
deeply
you

like
to
feel
into
this
release
through
a
deep
sigh
exhaling
all

out
of

nothing
remains

once
all

have
been
dissolved
this
orb
of
energy
begins
to
shrink

not
disappearing

this
soft

glow
appears
as
a
pearl
pristine
clear
and
sparkling
it
hovers
in
the

between
the

for
another

you
come
to

deep
and
profound
silence
within
its

with
this
silence
for

reaches

floating
a

take
a

our
thoughts
often
when
we
wake
we
carry
fragments
of
our
dreams
and
we
hold
on
to
thoughts
about
the
days
behind
and
the
days
ahead
of
us

simply
begin
to

from

place
of
non-attachment

may
be
carrying
in

to
nurture
these

draw
your

to
anything
arising
in
the

now
there
is
no
need
to
search
for
anything
simply
observe
yourself
open
up
to
the
thoughts
that
may
be
pre-existing
or
as
they
make
themselves
known
just
witness
the
nature

them

in

release
them
knowing
that
they
are

about

may
be
to
come

to
allow

to
guide
you
through

gentle
awakening
of
the
senses
noticing
how
you
are
inextricably
linked
through
the
breath
to
the
world
outside
of
you
allow
each
in-breath
to
nourish
you

free
you

may
be

to
draw

to

do
watch
the

the
breath
flows
in
through

filling
the
entirety
of

lungs
and
causes
the
stomach
to
expand

things
that

anything
out

anything
less
than
your

simply

it

it
and
allow
it
to
dissipate
whatever
we
envision
on
a
regular
basis
we
start
to
manifest
in
the
outer

consciously
reflect
for
a
moment
on
whatever
it
is
your
highest
self
wishes
to
manifest
in
your
life
or
more
specifically
in
the

what
is
the

yearning
of
your

[

what

the

you

to
subside

a

begin
to
narrow
in
on
what
is
it
you
wish
to
manifest
considering
for
a

that
you
already
hold
whatever
it
is
you
may
take
a
few
moments
to
breathe
into
this

as
if
it

already
present
within

allow
your
thoughts
to
be
clear
and
conscious
stemming
from
the
core
of
who
you
are
you
might
like
to
consider
in
the
words
of
Rumi
what
you
seek
is
seeking
you
[

just
allow
the
openness
of
your
heart
to
hold
the
truth
that
whatever
you
hope
to
embody
is
already
here
it
is
already
present
within
you

just
coming
back
to
the
body
now
and
taking
in
a
few
more
grounding
breaths
before
setting
a
powerful
intention
for
the
day
ahead
allow
yourself
to
be
completely
here
knowing
that
in
truth
there
is
no
where
you
need
to
go
and
nothing
you
need
to
achieve
as
we
increase
our
ability
to
be
fully
present
you
might
find
limiting
thoughts
begin
to
fall
away
and
you
begin
to
embody
more
deeply
the
truth
of
who
you
are
take
three
silent
and
steady
breaths
here
routing
yourself
in
the
expanding
energy
of
this
morning
you
so
from
this
place
of
pure
presence
I
invite
you
now
to
set
one
more
clear
and
powerful
intention
for
your
day
consider
whatever
it
is
you
wish
to
embody
and
state
it
to
yourself
as
if
it
were
already
here
for
instance
if
you
are
longing
is
for
self
confidence
and
esteem
consider
a
phrase
such
as
I
am
confident
and
complete
or
if
the
stability
and
safety
are
of
your
highest
concern
perhaps
an
affirmation
like
all
of
my
deepest
needs
are
being
met
just
allow
yourself
to
become
very
clear
and
focused
on
your
intention
as
you
begin
to
repeat
it
to
yourself
with
each
full
breath
so
take
a
few
moments
of
silence
here
as
you
align
your
intention
with
your
breath
letting
the
words
fill
you
up
entirely
again
and
again
but
just
a
few
moments
[

so
wherever
you
are

resting
come
to

and
take
three
more
full
breaths
here
knowing
that
you
are
unconditionally
supported
in
this
journey
gently
begin
to
soften
the
area
around
the

into
a
comfortable
lying
down
position
using
any
blankets
and
cushions
to
support
your
body
where
needed
if

on

peaceful
state
I
invite
you
now
to
simply
bring
your
attention
to
your
breath
without
trying

shift
it
in
any
way
just
gently
open
your
awareness
to
it
observing
its

flow
rhythm
and
depth
[

notice
the
way
the
breath
comes
and
goes
on
its
own
accord
guided
by
an
innate
wisdom
that
does
not
require
any
effort
on
your
part
it
simply
comes
and
goes
just
as
the
ocean
eps
and
flows
[

[

as
you
draw
awareness
to
the
breath
notice
if
it
naturally
shifts
in
any
way
again
there
is
no
need
to
intervene
or
manipulate
its
rhythm
but
you
may
find
that
as
you
tune
into
the
breath
it
might
naturally
deepen
slow
down
or
adjust
itself
in
some
other
way
just
notice
if
this
is
true
for
you
and
also
notice
if
it
is
not
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
way
to
notice
the
breath
simply
observe
at
however
it
comes
and
follow
it
wherever
it
flows

[

throughout
this
meditation
the
mind
may
entangle
itself
in
thoughts
of
the
past
or
in
visions
of
what
might
come
to
be
if
for
when
it
does
simply
acknowledge
this
tendency
as
a
movement
away
from
this
present
moment
before
drawing
your
attention
back
to
the
breath
if
thoughts
arise
simply
witness
them
for
a
moment
with
compassion
and
non
judgment
before
returning
to
your
unchangeable
center
no
matter
how
frequently
they
crop
up
no
that
is
entirely
normal
for
thoughts
to
rise
and
entirely
possible
to
gently
let
them
go
use
the
breath
as
your
anchor
at
any
point
during
this
meditation
to
reground
yourself
in
the
physical
place
that
you
rest
you
[

draw
your
awareness
now
to
the
stomach
noticing
its
natural
rise
and
fall
as
breath
moves
through
you
in
our
busy
day
to
day
activities
we
often
breathe
primarily
from
the
chest
restricting
our
breaths
range
of
movement
this
shallow
breathing
engages
our
stress
response
and
releases
a
surge
of
hormones
that
temporarily
increase
our
blood
pressure
as
we
naturally
expand
the
breaths
movement
moving
it
effortlessly
into
the
stomach
we
activate
the
relaxation
response
this
deeper
breathing
pauses
out
of
an
inner
state
of
stress
and
helps
us
to
sink
effortlessly
into
stillness
and
soon
into
a
state
of
deep
sleep
continue
to
focus
your
attention
on
the
stomach
noticing
just
how
far
the
breath
can
go

to
rest
aside

search
for

force
them
in

open
up
entirely
to
whatever
moves
through

this
journey
allow
this
meditation
in

moment
to
naturally
reveal
itself
as
you
move
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
past
so
before
we
begin
take
a
moment
or
two
to
come
into
a
comfortable
lying
down
position

sure
that
you
feel
safe
and
secure
wherever
you
are
ensure
that
your
neck
is
aligned
with
the

and
your

are
relaxed

a

to
consciously
release
all
muscles
as
you
sink
further

guide
you
towards
a
place
of
complete
stillness

although
we
will
be
moving
through
the
expansive
field
of
time
you
can
always
ground
yourself
back
into
the
present
moment
if
you
feel
uncomfortable
at
any
point
you
are
in
complete
control
of
this

images
arise

if
the
experience
becomes
heavy
you
are
also
in
an

guide
us
forward

way
the
surfaces
around

make
contact
with
your
physical

feel
into
the
textures
that
are
present
without
moving
noting
how
they
feel
as
they
rest
against

to
relax

sink
further
into

energy
passing
before

all
is
quiet
or
is
at
peace
now
something
starts
to
appear
before
your
eyes
out
of
the
vast
empty
space
before
you
you
notice
a
mist
developing
it
is
airy
and
then
chanted
somehow
beckoning
you
closer
you
take
a
few
steps
towards
this
mist
very
slowly
and
mindfully
and
as
you
approach
it
begins
to
dissipate
as
it
slowly
clears
you
begin
to
see
there
is
a
bridge
ahead
of
you
covered
in
moss
and
vines
you
make
your
way
towards
it
mindfully
treading
on
the
pressed
earth
beneath
your
feet
and
as
you
cross
over
everything
you
ever
knew
begins
to
disappear
all
thought
all
attachments
all
fears
and
all
worries
you
are
entering
into
a
new
world
into
a
different
time
with
every
step
you
take
you
inch
closer
towards
the
space
and
time
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
it
is
a
place
that
feels
familiar
somehow
but
one
that
your
conscious
mind
can
not
put
any
memory
to
the
mist
continues
to
clear
and
you
realize
you
are
within
a
dense
majestic
forest
you
feel
at
home
you
feel
at
peace
here
he
reached
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
and
with
the
mist
having
vanished
completely
now
you
take
a
closer
look
at
the
scenery
around
you
notice
the
colors
and
textures
of
this
vibrant
forest
consider
the
way
the
earth
feels
beneath
your
feet
you
heighten
your
awareness
of
the
aroma
that
awakens
as
you
inhale
deeply
allow
this
place
to
nurture
the
deep
sense
of
peace
that
is
within
you
you
walk
forward
ever
so
slightly
as
you
noticed
something
peeking
through
from
within
the
trees
and
as
you
approach
you
realize
there
is
a
cabin
hidden
within
these
woods
and
somehow
you
sense
that
it
is
or
was
your
own
you
instantly
remember
it
perhaps
becoming
flooded
with
visions
of
what
it
was
once
like
in
your
own
time
you
reach
the
front
door
and
enter

a
few
moments

to
arise
in

quite
effortlessly

what

that
it
provides

everything

dissipates

crossed
over

hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
as
you
prepare
for
a
deep
and
nourishing
sleep
this
meditation
will
guide
you
into
manifesting
a
beautiful
and
loving
relationship
of
your
highest
dreams
one
that
is
in
alignment
with
your
truest
self
the
relationship
that
you
come
to
manifest
will
be
aligned
with
your
own
unique
needs
and
personal
journey
perhaps
it
is
a
romantic
partner
you
are
currently
attracting
or
a
deeper
friendship
of
some
other
form
regardless
of
what
your
heart
most
deeply
yearns
for
this
meditation
will
help
you
to
manifest
that
relationship
upon
a
foundation
of
trust
allowing
you
to
rest
easy
and
sing
into
a
deep
and
enriching
sleep
[

so
before
we
begin
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
using
any
desired
cushions
or
blankets
for
support
and
warmth
and
adjust
your
body
so
that
it
rests
comfortably
allow
the
body
to
move
itself
so
that
any
physical
or
tension
or
tightness
can
begin
the
process
of
release
so
just
prepare
yourself
and
your
environment
in
any
way
necessary
so
that
this
day
may
be
left
behind
set
any
alarms
now
and
turn
off
all
lights
if
your
mind
and
body
a
moment
to
sink
into
this
place
and
time
exactly
as
it
is
knowing
that
there
is
nothing
more
to
do
or
to
be
taken
care
of
[
Music
]
now
take
a
moment
to
connect
with
your
breath
without
trying
to
change
it
or
manipulate
it
in
any
way
I
invite
you
to
simply
become
aware
of
its
natural
flow
our
breath
carries
an
innate
wisdom
of
its
own
and
does
not
need
to
be
altered
in
any
way
while
it
is
sometimes
beneficial
to
deepen
or
direct
the
breath
in
certain
manners
for
right
now
I
invite
you
to
simply
be
very
present
with
the
natural
state
of
your
being
[
Music

there
may
be
aspects
of
the
day
that
linger
in
your
mind
or
there
may
be
thoughts
about
tomorrow
if
any
of
these
sorts
of
thoughts
exist
within
you
simply
witness
them
acknowledging
that
they
are
not
required
in
this
very
moment
remind
yourself
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
here
and
now
all
that
is
required
of
you
is
deep
presence
with
your
breath
and
with
this
moment

draw
your
attention
now
to
the
hard
space
as
you
breathe
allow
the
heart
to
gently
expand
with
each
inhalation
and
gently
soften
with
each
exhalation
take
a
few
silent
breaths
here
from
your
heart
center
as
you
begin
to
soften
its
walls
and
open
to
the
endless
possibilities
of
love
and
deep
connection
love
is
abundant
its
presence
is
everywhere
and
as
you
sink
further
into
this
meditation
you
will
begin
to
touch
the
truth
that
love
exists
all
around
and
within
each
of
us
[

you
are
invited
now
to
cultivate
an
awareness
of
and
an
appreciation
for
your
innate
radiance
beauty
and
divinity
[
Music
]
in
order
to
manifest
and
outer
love
it
is
necessary
to
first
acknowledge
the
inner
one
complete
and
perfect
in
and
of
itself
if
any
thoughts
arise
attempting
to
intervene
with
your
experience
of
self-love
simply
witness
them
and
then
allow
these
thoughts
to
gently
melt
away
as
swiftly
as
they
came
[
Music

take
a
few
moments
right
now
to
gently
introduce
the
words
I
am
made
of
love
I
am
made
of
love
I
am
made
of
love
just
allow
these
words
to
flow
into
the
heart
space
with
each
breath
allow
them
to
soften
the
heart
further
dissolving
any
preconceived
notions
that
may
stand
in
their
way
[
Music

it
may
not
come
easily
to
self
love
it
may
trigger
a
rising
resistance
and
know
that
if
this
is
the
case
this
too
is
okay
know
that
any
resistance
does
not
make
the
truth
of
your
innate
beauty
and
radiance
less
valid
resistance
that
arises
is
simply
born
of
prior
conditioning
that
has
led
us
to
forget
the
truth
that
we
are
in
fact
made
of
love
love
runs
through
each
of
our
cells
and
as
we
become
more
aware
of
its
presence
within
us
we
are
able
to
attract
more
of
it
from
the
outer
world
so
take
a
few
more
moments
to
allow
these
words
to
permeate
your
being
I
am
made
of
love
I
am
made
of
love
I
am
made
of
love
[
Music

if
any
emotions
arise
know
that
this
is
entirely
okay
allow
these
emotions
to
free
you
allow
them
to
melt
away
taking
limiting
notions
along
with
them
as
they
disobeyed
emotions
are
often
tired
with
words
and
stories
if
stories
emerge
in
the
mind
simply
acknowledge
them
without
allowing
them
to
attach
themselves
to
you
you
are
made
of
love
any
wording
or
stories
that
contradict
this
truth
is
not
born
of
your
truest
nature
so
take
three
more
deep
breaths
with
these
words
held
in
mind
and
heart
I
am
made
of
love
I
am
made
of

that
needs
to
be
done
here
as
the
day
fades
into
night
all
that
is
asked
off
is
that
you
surrender
in
this
moment
can
you
release
yourself
into
this
safety
comfort
and
loving
support
of
a
deep
and
nourishing
sleep
allow
the
heart
space
to
be
your
anchor
as
you
slowly
make
your
way
towards
a
restful
slumber
notice
how
it
rises
and
falls
with
each
breath
taken
this
breath
supports
you
through
waking
life
and
through
sleep
continually
bringing
nourishment
to
the
body
mind
and
soul
[
Music

continue
to
breathe
deeply
gently
rocking
yourself
to
sleep
resting
in
the
true
knowledge
that
love
is
abundant
love
is
ever-present
and
that
the
love
you
yearn
for
is
making
its
way
towards
you
what
you
seek
is
also
seeking
you
love
is
all
around

breath

slightly
cool
sensation
as
the
air
passes
through
your
nostrils
perhaps
you
feel
a
floating
sensation
as
your
abdomen
and
chest
rise
and
fill
with
breath
or
a
heaviness
as
the
air
moves
out
of
your
body
taking
with
it
any
tension
or
tightness
whatever
you
are
feeling
is
just
right

observe
the
experience
as
you
inhale
sense
an
opening
or
a
creation
of
spaciousness
at
the
area
of
your
heart
and
when
you
exhale
feel
a
gentle
compression
in
this
area
as

lungs
are
giving
your
heart
a
hug

support
from

inner
companion

the
inner
hug

i

then
inviting
your
exhale
to
be
slightly
longer
than
your
inhale
you
can
always
welcome
a
short
pause
after
you
exhale
trusting
that
your
body
will
know
when

breathe
in
again
begin
to
intentionally
inhale
deeply
and
extend
your
exhale
slightly
longer
than
your
inhale
after

a
brief
pause
for
the
length
of
time

the
timing

way

the
wisdom
of
your
body
in
connection
with
your
inner
companion
allow
each
exhale
to
carry
away
with
it
any
physical
or
emotional
stress
and
tension

the
weight
of
the
world
on

areas
in

around

attention
through
various
parts
of
your
body
without
effort
let
go
of
stories
or
expectations
of
these
parts
of
your
body
and
notice
them
as
if
meeting
them
for
the
first
time
[
Music
]
as
your
focus
flows
your
energy
will
follow
and

will
invite
ease
into
your
body
[

physical
body
continues
to
relax

the
sensations
at

your
left
eye

the
tiny
muscles
and
nerves
in
and
around
both
of
your
eyes
and

as
your
eyelids
become
heavy
[

sense
your
right
cheek
from
the
outside

of
your
cheeks

both
sides

to
the
inside

the
idea
of
a
smile

part
of
a
smile
we

is
on

is
so
much
this
simple
gesture
can
convey
to
another
person
as
well
as
make
us
feel
from
within

is
only
part
of
how
a
smile
can

a
fraction
of

smile
on

[
Music
]

smile
can
change
your
mood

about
yourself
and
others

can
alter
your
perspective
and
bring
joy
to
your
state
of
being
as
you
explore
and
connect
with
your
physical
experience
look
inward
and
consider
what
it
would
feel
like
to
draw
a
connection
between
a
smile
on
your
face
with
a
smiling
at
your
heart
how
would
it
feel
to
be
smiling
from
your
heart
perhaps
you
might
experience
a
smile
of
the
heart
with
each
inhale
as
your
chest
rises
[
Music
]
and
your
collarbones
widen
then
each
exhale
your
lungs
continue
to
give
your
heart
another
hug
as
you
inhale
in
your
mind
think
i
am
smiling

in
your
mind
think
i
am
supporting
myself
with
a
hug

the
sensations
of
the
smile
from
your
face
to
move
down
to
the
space
around
your
heart
allow
these
smiling
qualities
to
surround
you
like
a
warm
embrace
of
a
loved
one
connect
with
your
smile
with
every
breath
you
take
as
a
reminder
to
come
back
to
yourself
if
you
find
your
mind
wandering
lovingly
bring
your
attention
back
to
your
smile
and
to
each
breath
inhale
i
am
smiling
exhale
i
am
supporting
myself
with

thank
you

joining
me
now
is
your
time
to
relax
and
connect
with
what
is
good
in
your
life
as
you
settle
in
if
it
feels
right
to
you
take
a
moment
to
set
an
intention
something
you
can
commit
to
and
let
's
sink
into
your

as

deeply
begin

I
invite

close

if

like
and
settle
in
to
comfort
let
your

sink
into

make
any
adjustments

comforted
at

that
everything
is
okay
there
is
nowhere
to
go
and
nothing
to
do
you
have
set
aside
this
time
to
simply
relax
and
drift
off
into
sleep
there
is
no
need
to
worry
if
you
do
n't
hear
everything
I
say
the
deepest
part
of
you
is
listening
if
it
feels
right
to
you
place
your
left
hand
over
your
heart
and
your
right
hand
on

have
taken
to
shift
to
a
positive
mindset
and
connect
with
gratitude
may
you
experience
peace
joy
and
a
connection
with
gratitude
may
this
practice
invite
you
to
cherish
all
that
you
are
and
all
that
you
have
in
this
moment
and
may
you
be
open
to
see
the
positive
silver
linings
of
your
experiences

a
variety
of
processes
going
on
at
the

time
when
the
various
parts
of
your

come
together
in
harmony
the
sound
of
your

existence
can
take
shape
in
physical

and
the
song
of
your
soul
can
be
played
at
times
the

can
be
dark

chaotic
and
other
times
it
can
be
peaceful

my

is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
guided
bedtime
meditation
that
will
help
you
to
fall
asleep
quickly
and
soundly
over
the
course
of
this
meditation
you
will
move
deeper
and
deeper
into

releasing
all

tension
before
being
guided
into
a
beautiful
visualization
that
will
enhance
your
inner
sense
of
peace
and
tranquility
there
is
nothing
required
for
you
to
actively
do
here
you
are
simply
invited
to
open
your
mind
as
you
are
guided
naturally
towards
a
peaceful
slumber
before
you
settle
into
the
space
you
're
in
take
a
moment
to
ensure
that
your
blinds
are
drawn
and
your
morning
alarm
is
set
when
you
're
ready
to
put
the
day
behind
you
and
sure
you
're
in
a
comfortable
lying
down
position
as
you
prepare
for
complete
release
and
relaxation
use
any
blankets
and
cushions
to
support
yourself
as
necessary
and
when
you
are
in
utmost
comfort
take
a
few
slow
and
grounding
breaths
to
connect
with
this
moment
in
space
and
time
[
Music
]
the
breath
is
a
gateway
into
the
present
moment
and
into
deep
release
and
greater
alignment
though
this
invisible
life
forced
often
goes
overlooked
it
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
tools
of
relaxation
available
to
us
in
any
given
moment
so
take
this
opportunity
now
to
witness
the
breath
to
simply
observe
its
depth
and
rhythm
allowing
it
to
deepen
as
you
naturally
ease
your
way
into
this
period
of
darkness
draw
your
attention
to
the
stomach
noticing
the
way
the
breath
follows
suit
as
we
consciously
welcome
our
breath
into
the
belly
we
initiate
the
body
's
relaxation
response
lowering
stress
hormones
blood
pressure
muscle
tension
and
our
breathing
rate
inhale
all
the
way
into
the
base
of
the
spine
and
then
exhale
completely
softening
all
muscles
as
you
surrender
a
little
bit
further
now
I
invite
you
to
introduce
small
pauses
between
inhalation
and
exhalation
resting
in
complete
stillness
for
just
a
moment
after
each
in-breath
and
each
out
breath
so
it
's
going
to
be
inhale
to
a
count
of
four
pause
for
a
brief
moment
and
then
exhale
completely
for
a
count
of
four
pausing
for
just
a
moment
of
complete
stillness
once
again
witness
the
body
relaxing
more
fully
as
you
breathe
in
the
slow
and
steady
way
for
three
more
rounds
on
your
own
now
[
Music

gently
release
your
attention
from
the
breath
now
tuning
into
the
visceral
sensations
of
the
body
hold
the
entire
body
in
your
awareness
for
a
few
moments
noticing
if
there
's
any
physical
tension
or
contraction
present
if
you
come
across
any
area
in
need
of
love
and
release
just
gently
draw
your
breath
towards
this
region
on
your
next
inhalation
inviting
nourishing
light
to
support
your
full
release
and
as
you
exhale
allow
all
tightness
and
all
tension
to
dissipate
feeling
yourself
sink
more
completely
into
the
surface
beneath
you
as
you
welcome
release
into
the
physical
body
through
your
breath
the
mind
naturally
follows
suit
moving
into
greater
peace
and
harmony
so
follow
my
voice
as
you
are
guided
through
the
body
using
the
power
of
your
attention
to
grant
full
release
begin
by
a
breathing
loving-kindness
into
the
feet
area
releasing
any
heaviness
that
may
be
stored
here
breathe
into
the
legs
now
thanking
these
limbs
for
carrying
you
throughout
your
day
and
then
allowing
them
to
relax
completely
into
this
moment
[

inhale
deeply
now
into
the
hips
and
pelvis
softening
and
releasing
on
the
exhalation
and
then
move
to
the
belly
allowing
your
core
muscles
to
relax
and
the
breath
to
flow
effortlessly
into
this
area
of
the
body
[

hope
in
your
heart
and
chest
now
as
you
breathe
nourishing
lifeforce
into
this
center
of
your
pain
softening
on
the
exhale
[
Music

soften
your
hands
allowing
them
to
sink
into
the
surface
beneath
you
and
then
grant
the
same
release
to
your
arms
just
letting
them
melt
away
for
the
night
soften
your
shoulders
your
neck
region
your
jaw
your
cheeks
and
nose
and
your
eyes
take
a
moment
to
soften
the
eyebrows
in
the
forward
just
allowing
all
mental
tension
to
dissipate
as
you
release
all
muscles
surrounding
your
thinking
mind
hold
your
entire
body
in
your
awareness
now
allowing
it
to
be
completely
at
peace
in
this
present
moment
return
to
your
breath
for
a
couple
more
cycles
noticing
once
again
the
short
pauses
in
between
each
in-breath
and
each
out
breath
now
feeling
physically
relaxed
and
in
alignment
with
this
present
moment
I
invite
you
to
tune
in
to
the
mind
's
eye
without
force
or
strain
allow
the
following
visualization
to
conjure
images
of
deep
peace
and
tranquility
as
you
move
gracefully
into
a
deep
slumber
for
the
night
in
your
open
field
of
vision
now
begin
to
visualize
you
're
on
a
tropical
island
feet
firmly
grounded
into
the
warm
crystals
of
sand
that
stretch
out
to
either
side
of
you
where
you
rest
the
waters
are
shallow
off
the
coast
lending
themselves
to
crystal
clear
turquoise
hues
and
the
most
beautiful
waters
you
have
ever
laid
eyes
on
the
salty
breeze
infiltrates
your
nostrils
and
you
exhale
deeply
feeling
yourself
sink
further
into
this
paradise
island
that
warms
both
body
and
soul
you
take
a
few
steps
forward
slowly
eventually
coming
to
dip
your
toes
in
the
warm
yet
refreshing
waters
that
surround
this
small
Paradise
Island
standing
at
a
balance
point
between
ocean
and
earth
ankle
deep
in
those
turquoise
waters
inner
peace
flows
through
you
as
you
come
to
realize
you
are
whole
and
complete
just
as
you
are
you
yearn
to
dive
into
the
healing
salty
waters
before
you
and
so
prepare
yourself
for
this
descent
when
you
are
ready
you
begin
to
walk
slowly
and
mindfully
away
from
the
steady
Shore
step
by
step
until
soon
your
lower
legs
are
submerged
you
continue
walking
slowly
and
with
grace
until
soon
you
are
waist-deep
in
these
cleansing
waters
you
pause
here
tracing
the
surface
of
the
ocean
with
your
fingertips
and
when
you
are
ready
you
reach
your
arms
ahead
of
you
as
you
shallow
dive
into
the
crystal
clarity
that
now
bathes
your
entire
body
as
each
crystal
bead
of
ocean
rushes
along
your
skin
you
feel
restored
and
renewed
turning
onto
your
back
you
allow
your
body
to
float
on
the
still
surface
the
ocean
is
calm
and
quiet
nestling
you
continually
into
a
peaceful
state
that
lives
both
within
and
around
you
the
salt
water
cleanses
your
skin
rejuvenating
your
physical
body
energetically
it
penetrates
deeper
healing
and
nourishing
your
spiritual
and
emotional
bodies
all
trapped
emotions
and
all
old
energy
systems
are
absorbed
by
the
healing
potential
of
these
waters
this
process
of
renewal
leaves
you
free
to
relax
completely
floating
here
on
the
surface
of
the
water
you
are
in
a
state
of
complete
bliss
[
Music
]
the
mind
softens
entirely
nothing
tethered
to
it
any
longer
any
thoughts
that
do
rise
in
your
consciousness
are
released
to
the
ocean
as
swiftly
as
they
came
you
know
that
any
thoughts
or
emotions
that
arise
do
not
belong
to
you
there
are
simply
bodies
of
energy
coming
like
waves
before
dissolving
back
into
the
wholeness
of
the
ocean

Aya
's
transfixed
with
the
sky
you
notice
the
lighting
and
shade
overhead
is
shifting
blue
hues
now
blend
into
a
subtle
orange
signifying
that
the
Sun
is
now
setting
behind
the
horizon
you
take
this
as
a
cue
to
return
to
land
turning
back
towards
the
beach
and
the
canopy
of
palm
trees
that
overhang
it
you
return
to
your
feet
gliding
out
of
the
water
slowly
step
by
step
you
finally
come
to
reach
land
and
find
that
a
plush
towel
neatly
folded
on
the
warm
sand
has
been
sent
for
you
by
the
universe
you
wrap
yourself
in
this
warm
soothing
towel
and
begin
to
walk
slowly
down
the
beach
into
the
sunset
as
you
walk
you
open
your
senses
to
this
environment
you
notice
the
aroma
of
the
salty
air
continually
cleansing
you
with
each
breath
you
taste
the
salt
on
the
outer
edges
of
your
lips
left
behind
from
your
healing
dip
in
the
ocean
you
hear
the
gentle
rustling
of
palm
trees
a
subtle
lapping
of
water
against
the
shore
and
the
sound
of
release
that
comes
with
each
deep
exhale
you
make
tuning
into
your
sense
of
touch
you
feel
the
warmth
and
comfort
of
the
towel
against
your
skin
as
well
as
the
sweetness
of
sand
beneath
your
feet
staring
ahead
you
see
the
crest
of
beautiful
palm
trees
the
white
sand
slowly
becoming
darker
as
night
approaches
and
the
vibrant
sky
now
orange
and
magenta
as
the
Sun
has
disappeared
behind
the
horizon
just
a
dozen
yards
ahead
of
you
firmly
grounded
in
the
shallow
waters
by
sturdy
stilts
you
see
an
overwater
bungalow
connected
to
the
shore
by
a
long
wooden
dock
this
is
your
own
private
Cabana
where
you
will
sleep
the
night
away
in
tranquillity
step-by-step
continuing
to
move
slowly
and
mindfully
you
make
your
way
back
to
the
dock
you
arrive
at
the
foot

lights
lie
in

as

your
way
towards
your
private
bungalow
by

light
you
feel
the
day
behind
you
dissipating
naturally
you
reach
the
end
of
the
dock
arriving
at
the
door
of
your
Cabana
turning
the

admire
the

warm
interiors
that
nourish

a

you
with

Sun
when

fresh
fruits
will
energize
your

when

for

you
turn
your
full
attention
to
the
four-poster
bed
in

center
of

room
a
plush
white
quilt
is
draped
over
top
and
white
lace
curtains
pulled
back
and
tied
elegantly
to
each
side
preparing
a

deep
slumber
you
climb
inside
this
cozy
and
welcoming
bed
ready
to
rest
peacefully
for
the
night
so
that
you
may
wake
inspired
and
energized
when

comes
notice
the
comfort
of
the
blankets
and
cushions
that
support
you
here
notice
the
peace
and
quiet
that
beckons
you
into
a
deep
slumber
all
you
hear
are
the
subtle
sounds
of
the
ocean
and
your
own
slow
steady
breathing
take
a
few
last
moments
to
revel
in
this
beauty
of
this
setting
soaking
it
up
in
spirit
gently
allow
the
visuals
to
dissipate
returning
to
your
physical
reality
carrying
the
same
peace
and
stillness
you
've
found
there
by
the
ocean
you
are
safe
and
supported
here
resting
peacefully
and
soundly
as
you
slowly
slip
into
a
deep
slumber
as
you
drift
off
to
sleep
allow
the
following
affirmations
to
fill
every
cell
of
your
being
positively
transforming

hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
guided
visualization
it
's
designed
to
promote
peace
of
mind
for
returned
soldiers
experiencing
post-traumatic
stress
upon
returning
home
before
we
move
into
this
visual
journey
I
would
like
to
acknowledge
that
this
recording
is
not
a
replacement
for
professional
support
but
rather
it
is
a
tool
that
can
help
you
to
explore
the
possibility
of
finding
a
safe
and
comfortable
place
within
yourself
it
is
an
anchor
into
the
present
moment
of
course
I
encourage
anyone
listening
to
this
to
seek
the
support
that
they
need
from
professionals
and
use
this
meditation
solely
as
a
peaceful
way
to
help
you
find
peace
and
release
during
those
quiet
moments
before
falling
asleep
so
before
we
begin
I
invite
you
to
make
sure
that
you
are
entirely
comfortable
in
the
place
that
you
are
now
in
if
there
's
anything
that
brings
you
extra
peace
and
comfort
reach
out
for
these
now
and
this
could
be
as
simple
as
your
pillow
a
sacred
object
on
your
bedside
table
or
anything
at
all
that
brings
you
more
comfort
so
making
sure
that
you
're
in
a
comfortable
lying
down
position
and
take
a
few
full
settling
breaths
here
as
you
ground
yourself
into
this
space
at
any
point
during
this
meditation
or
at
any
point
throughout
the
days
and
nights
to
come
I
invite
you
to
remember
that
your
breath
is
always
available
as
an
anchor
into
the
present
moment
each
time
we
draw
our
awareness
to
the
breath
the
past
disappears
the
future
disappears
and
we
are
reminded
of
the
stillness
that
lives
in
this
very
moment
breath
awareness
requires
nothing
but
your
attention
and
can
be
practiced
at
any
time
for
just
a
few
seconds
or
for
many
so
right
now
follow
my
voice
for
the
next
short
while
as
you
deepen
your
awareness
of
this
life
force
that
flows
in
and
out
of
your
body
constantly
as
you
inhale
become
more
observant
of
your
sensory
experience
as
the
air
flows
into
your
nostrils
through
your
windpipe
and
deep
into
your
lungs
[
Music
]
and
as
you
exhale
witness
the
release
that
occurs
as
the
belly
softens
the
chest
falls
and
your
mind
just
drops
away
continue
to
breathe
with
this
heightened
awareness
paying
close
attention
to
the
pauses
in
between
each
breath
cycle
so
after
each
inhalation
see
if
you
can
notice
the
complete
stillness
where
the
breath
is
held
for
just
a
brief
second
and
after
each
exhalation
observe
that
momentary
stillness
after
all
the
air
has
been
released
and
just
in
your
own
time
repeating
this
observation
on
your
own
for
a
few
more
breaths
cycles

know
that
wherever
you
have
been
whatever
lingers
from
days
now
behind
you
you
exist
nowhere
but
in
this
present
moment
reality
allow
the
breath
and
your
physical
body
to
remind
you
of
this
moving
deeply
into
your
physical
presence
anytime
the
mind
wanders
into
stories
or
images
of
the
past
you
are
here
you
are
held
by
your
breath
your
body

right

[

while
we
can
not
change
what
has
happened
in
the
past
we
can
continually
draw
ourselves
more
affirmative
ly
into
today
by
welcoming
ourselves
exactly
as
we
are
into
the
reality
of
this
present
moment
we
find
space
to
honor
where
we
've
been
while
also
knowing
that
we
are
only
ever
right
here
right
now
this
is
the
only
time
we
truly
have
so
in
just
a
moment
you
will
be
guided
through
a
safe
and
soothing
visualization
to
help
you
tune
into
more
completely
to
the
present
moment
take
a
few
more
slow
and
steady
breaths
and
just
after
a
few
cycles
let
's
begin
[

you
[
Music

shifting
your
attention
now
away
from
your
breath
and
into
the
empty
space
behind
your
closed
eyes
and
this
space
holds
infinite
potential
for
freedom
and
release
when
we
adorn
it
with
images

be
from

there
are
no
rules

to
what
this

looks

so
long
as

provides
you
with
the

that
you
are
safe
supported
and
held
exactly
as

[

explore
this

into

what

the

there
any

what

they

in
your

as
you
move
forward
if
you
feel
more
at
peace
in
this
space
alone
know
that
this
is
entirely
okay
as
well
from
moment
to
moment
we
require
different
things
sometimes
it
is
the
support
of
those
who
love
us
sometimes
it
is
our
personal
connection
to
our
highest
self
to
nature
to
universe
if
the
latter
is
true
for
you
in
this
moment
invite
your
higher
self
the
natural
world
or
your
understanding
of
God
or
the
universe
into
the
space
within
you
even
if
you
have
welcomed
humans
or
pets
into
the
visualization
already
you
too
may
also
invite
these
deeper
connections
to
support
you
right
now
if
emotions
arise
simply
acknowledge
them
and
witness
them
as
passing
clouds
tuning
in
to
how
they
feel
within
the
body
rather
than
the
story
that
they
weave
in
the
mind
just
trust
that
this
beautiful
safe
space
you
have
created
as
the
capacity
to
hold
you
exactly
as
you
are
and
know
that
there
is
no
weakness
in
feeling
emotion
our
emotions
are
a
part
of
what
makes
us
human
and
they
are

welcome

now

you

the

reads
for

this

has
presented
itself
for
you
so
that
you
may
have
a
safe
space
to
place
any
recurring
images
or
dreams
about
the
past
whatever
you
have
witnessed
and
experienced
can
not
be
taken
away
from
you
however
the
past
can
be
laid
gently
to
rest
tucked
away
in
a
safe
corner
of
the
soul
to
inspire
the
next
stage
of
your

take
the
album
in
your
hands
breathing
deeply
as
you
hold
it
in
quiet
reverence
[

if
any
challenging
thoughts

images
arise
in
your
consciousness
turn
these
into
photographs

tuck
them
gently
into

laying
the
past
down
this
way
in
help
to
honor
where
you
've
been
while
creating
space
for
lighter
imagery

to
take
root
this
is

where
you

been

it
may
serve
as
a
reminder

these

snapshots

you
have
a
brighter
lighter
future
to
look
forward
to

take
a
few
more
silent
moments
to
respectfully
tuck
away
any
old
photographs
that
no
longer
need
to
take
up
space
in
the
forefront
of
your
mind
if
the
imagery
does
not
arise
naturally
or
if
it
is
too
painful
for

to
process
in

I

I
invite
you
to
close
the

now
knowing
that
you
can
come
back
to
it
at
any
time
you
need
to
store
the
passed
away
for
safekeeping
and
remember
that
none
of
this
is
a
denial
of
the
life
you
have
lived
it
is
simply
a
way
of
clearing
space
for
new
life
to
emerge
take
a
few
final
moments
now
to
tune
back
into
the
beautiful
room

you
have
visualized
using
your

to
ground
you
here
for

a
few
more

look

support

your
highest
self
the

anything
else
in

you
find
peace
meaning
and
contentment
come
back
to
your
breath
remembering
that
this
very
simple
life
force
that
we
so
often
take
for
granted
is
a
pathway
back
to
the
present
moment
back
into
peace
gently
now
allow
the
scene
you
have
created
to
begin
dissolving
as
you
reconnect
with
your
awareness
of
your
body
in
the
room
and
physically
support
you
allow
each
muscle
to
soften
melting
further
into

beneath

draw
the
mind
down
into

thanking
yourself
for
harnessing
the
courage
and

required
to
move
through
this

closing
your
eyes
and
take
a
moment
now
to
see
if
you
can
feel
into
the
physical
space
that
supports

the
way
your

is
held
in
the
safety

witness
the
way
that
breath
flows
through
you
come
to
see
how
effortlessly
it
fills
your
physical
body

then
how
naturally
it
glides
back
into
the
outer
environment
for
a
few
moments
now
draw
your
attention
to
your
breath

to
ground

the
outside
world
gently
falls
away
as
you
are
guided
continuously
via
the
breath
back
into
this
very
moment
in
time
now
without
attempting
to
change
your
breath
in
any
way
I
invite
you
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
belly
simply
observe
the
way
it
rises
and
the
way
it
falls
and
notice
what
happens
to
the
breath
as
you
draw
your
attention
to
the
stomach
what
happens
to
the
body
is
there
a
softening
or
possibly
a
sense
of
release
is
the
ease
or
unease
whatever
may
be
the
case
for
you
simply
acknowledge
what
is
present
within
the
body
as
you
shift
your
attention
from
breath
to
belly

getting
to
know
the
body
in
this
way
facilitates
your
ability
to
heal
itself
this
type
of
getting
to
know
the
body
is
not
intellectual
in
any
way
it's
experiential
through
this
meditation
you
're
invited
to
become
more
intimate
with
the
physical
body
witnessing
it
exactly
as
it
rests
here
right
in
this
very
moment
by
practicing
this
deep
presence
we
shift
from
thinking
into
feeling
and
into
being
by
allowing
the
body
to
be
exactly
as
it
is
and
by
bringing
our
awareness
to
it
we
begin
to
soften
the
mental
preconceptions
maintaining
their
firm
grip
on
our
beliefs
about
the
body
gently
allow
any
firmly
held
concepts
to
melt
away
allowing
a
deeper
experience
of
full
openness
and
presence
to
take
its
place
[

come
back
to
the
breath
for
a
few
moments
allowing

to
continually
carry
you
into
each
unfolding
moment

by
breath
moment
by
moment
[

I
invite
you
now
to
expand
the
scope
of
your
breath
on
your
next
inhalation
gently
guide
or
envision
the
breath
spanning
all
the
way
down
to
your
toes
and
on
the
next
exhalation
guide
the
breath
to
the
top
of
your
head
nourishing
each
part
as
it
passes
continue
to
envision
the
breath
looping
gently
through
your
body
this
way
softening
every
area
of
stress
or
tension
that
it
touches
take
a
few
moments
of
silence
here
allowing
the
breath
to
soothe
every
cell
of
your
body
[
Music
]
as
you
come
to
be
more
in
touch
with
the
body
on
a
deeper
level
take
a
moment
to
consider
that
you
are
made
up
of
trillions
of
cells
each
of
these
cells
intermingles
with
the
others
in
order
to
keep
you
alive
and
well
as
you
rest
in
meditation
the
body
welcomes
this
space
and
time
provided
to
heal
itself
on
a
deep
level
sale
a
level
know
that
right
now
the
body
is
taking
care
of
itself
to
bring
you
into
a
greater
sense
of
vitality
and
wellness
so
take
a
moment
now
to
gently
scan
the
body
noticing
any
spiraling
sensations
of
energy
moving
through
you
as
you
come
to
feel
the
body
on
an
energetic
level
see
if
you
begin
to
consciously
touch
the
cellular
level
of
the
body
take
a
few
moments
of
silence
here
to
dive
into
the
subtle
realms
of
the
body
to
those
parts
that
go
invisible
to
the
eye
[
Music

draw
your
awareness
naturally
to
various
areas
of
the
body
allowing
yourself
to
be
guided
by
your
inner
compass
simply
notice
what
you
notice
simply
allow
yourself
to
feel
what
you
feel
your
own
inner
wisdom
will
guide
you
let
any
notions
about
what
this
experience
should
be
like
just
to
fall
away
and
as
you
move
deeply
into
yourself
take
time
to
notice
any
areas
of
tension
pain
or
discomfort
[
Music
]
now
this
pain
or
discomfort
may
be
primarily
physical
it
may
be
emotional
or
energetic
simply
notice
what
areas
of
your
being
are
calling
to
you
for
healing
take
a
moment
to
focus
on
one
area
of
the
body
or
mind
that
is
speaking
to
you
through
discomfort
or
tension
as
you
bring
your
attention
to
this
area
allow
your
breath
to
follow
this
awareness
just
gently
and
naturally
allow
your
breath
and
your
inner
capacity
for
compassion
to
touch
this
place
[
Music

without
trying
to
change
anything
about
this
experience
allow
the
discomfort
to
be
bathed
by
the
warmth
of
your
breath
and
by
your
loving
presence
so
take
a
few
moments
of
silence
here
as
you
allow
your
body
to
heal
on
a
cellular
level
[
Music

you
[
Music

now
gently
loosen
your
attention
coming
back
to
the
rhythm
of
your
natural
breath
remember
that
your
breath
is
your
anchor
and
if
at
any
point
your
mind
wanders
your
breath
is
always
available
to
redirect
you
to
your
present
experience
so
come
now
to
a
different
area
of
the
body
or
mind
to
a
second
aspect
of
you
in
need
of
a
little
extra
support
care
or
tenderness
invite
this
place
into
your
awareness
as
you
cleanse
it
with
your
inner
infinite
well
of
love
and
kindness
hold
it
compassionately
in
your
field
of
awareness
allowing
the
breath
to
soothe
it
and
as
you
breathe
let
any
tension
or
pain
that
is
held
there
to
slowly
soften
[
Music

continue
to
breathe
consciously
as
we
enter
a
few
moments
of
silence
during
which
you
may
dedicate
your
love
and
attention
to
this
second
area
of
your
being
[
Music

[
Music

gently
softening
your
inner
gaze
come
back
to
the
steady
flow
of
your
breath
allow
yourself
to
feel
into
a
deeper
stillness
and
sense
of
relaxation
that
is
present
to
you
right
now
know
that
your
body
is
being
healed
energetically
physically

emotionally
as

rest
here
in
stillness
so
come
now
to
one
more
area
of
the
body
physical
emotional
or
otherwise
energetic
that
is
calling
for
your
attention
do
not
seek
for
anything
to
come
to
you
simply
allow
it
to
enter
into
your
awareness
if
you
are
now
feeling
deeply
healed
and
relaxed
and
no
specific
aspect
of
your
being
is
appearing
hold
your
entire
body
in
the
field
of
your
awareness

breathe
into
the
area
that
has
come
to
you
or
into
your
entire
body
with
a
warm
and
loving
presence
allow
yourselves
to
transform
as
we
speak
perhaps
feeling
their
energetic
presence
within
the
body
and
mind
bathe
in
this
loving
attention
allowing
the
breath
to
nourish
and
to
heal

interlace
your

at

here

two

points
at
about

hairline
[

very
gently
lengthen
these
points
away
from
your
shoulders
you
might
sense
a
subtle
tilt
downward
of
your
chin
if

are
unable
to
place
your
hands
here
you
can
still
do
this
with
one
or
both
hands
by
your
sides
allow

right
as

be
dark

out
deeply
through

nose
take
about
three
more
breaths
allowing

to
let

open
and
without

to
your
left
as

are
able
just
like
you
did
on
the
other
side
continue
to
keep
your
eyes
to
your
left
as
you
breathe
in
and
out
deeply
for
a
total
of
four
breaths
allowing
yourself
to
sink
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
relaxed
awareness
of
yourself
once
more
with
your
eyes
open
and
without
moving
your
head
this
time
look
upwards

your
eyes
up
as
if
you
are
trying
to
look
at
your

eyebrows

in

eyes
beginning
to
blink
or
flutter
as
you
are
looking
up

in
and
out
once
more

eyes
to
close
down
as
your
eyelids
close
sense
the
muscles
in
and
around
your
eyes
becoming
relaxed
and
heavy
and
this
is
a
sign
to
the
rest
of
your
body
to
let
go
deeper
into
hypnosis
now

forget
all
about
your
eyes
and
allow

arms

rest
easy
by
your
sides

into
a
comfortable
lying
down
position

resting
position
will
do
but
try
to
ensure
that
your
chest
is
open
and
your
neck
is
in
line
with
your
spine
just
sink
a
little
bit
further
into
the
surface
that
supports
you
the
physical
world
will
nurture
you
throughout
the
journey
so
feel
free
to
invite
the
intention
to
surrender
to
your
body
and
mind
at
this
present
moment
letting
yourself
sink
deeply
into
the
physical
space
beneath
you
to
help
affirm
moment
to
repeat
the
following
words
after
me
I
am
free
to

to
let
go
I
am
free
to
let
go
now

release
any
and
all
words
that
are
circulating
within
the
mind
as
you
open
your
heart
and
body
allowing
them
to
guide
the
way
this
meditation
is
aimed
to
help
you
release
tension
in
the
body
and
to
let
go
of
all
stress
and
unease
that
is
present
in
the
mind
as
we
move
through
life
it
is
not
uncommon
to
become
weighed
down
by
things
that
have
happened
in
the
past
by
things
we
think
we
are
by
things
we
think
that
other
people
are
by
fears
about
the
future
and
while
there
are
doubtedly
many
challenges
that
exist
in
this
human
experience
we
can
help
to
reset
both
body
and
mind
by
consciously
inviting
ourselves
to
surrender
or
resistance
to
this
present
moment
because
the
truth
is
that
can
not
harm
you
can
not
harm
you
is
here
to
nourish
and
support
you
so
take
a
few
deep
breaths
now
as
you
remind
yourself
that
you
are
entirely
safe
right
here
right
now
you
now
draw
your
awareness
to
the
natural
rhythm
of
your
breath
without
trying
to
change
it
in
any
way
simply
observe
its
flow
and
depth
in
this
moment
you
notice
any
sensations
that
are
present
as
you
inhale
deeply
through
the
nose
and
as
you
exhale
completely
allowing
your
lungs
and
belly
to
soften
entirely
you
notice
the
sound
of
the
breath
makes
notice
the
way
the
breath
interacts
with
the
physical
body
putting
any
visceral
sensations
as
it
moves
through
you
a
few
moments
of
silence
he
simply
observing
your
direct
experience
of
the
breath
right
at
this
moment
you
draw
your
attention
now
to
the
belly
and
observe
the
way
the
breath
follows
you
there
allow
each
inhalation
to
expand
the
stomach
completely
exhalation
to
soften
the
belly
letting
all
tension
and
contraction
of
muscles
melt
away
the
depths
of
the
belly
as
you
breathe
allowing
your
breath
to
move
freely
to
the
furthest
corners
of
the
body
you
as
we
mindfully
allow
the
breath
to
touch
deeper
reaches
of
the
respiratory
system
we
unconsciously
activate
the
body
's
relaxation
response
this
response
helps
to
slow
a
racing
heart
sue
the
worried
mind
and
release
tense
muscles
take
a
few
moments
of
silence
now
to
consciously
observe
the
belly
and
the
breath
flowing
in
harmony
you
I
invite
you
now
to
tune
into
your
sense
of
sound
labeling
or
judging
anything
that
filters
through
your
ears
simply
become
aware
of
the
vibrations
that
enter
your
awareness
sounds
maybe
near
subtle
hole
loud
just
note
them
without
hanging
on
to
them
allowing
them
to
come
and
go
the
way
waves
and
flow
you
now
as
you
tune
into
the
sound
of
the
rain

to
fill
your
eardrums

cleanses
your

is
a
beautiful
and
powerful
tool
of
transformation

will
help
to
nourish

surrender
gently
now
to
the
healing
rain
that
falls
through
your
awareness
carry
your
attention
away
from
your
sense
of
sound

more
deeply
into

sense
of
touch

a
moment
to
observe
each
area
of
your
physical
body
that
is
in
contact
with
the
surface
beneath
you
see
if
you
can
notice
the
temperature
and
texture
of
each
surface
that
is
nestled
against
your
skin

if
you
can
release
a
little
bit
further
still
into
the
bed

any
other
surface
that
support
you

catch
the
mind
when

attempts
to
search
for
something

accept
this
present
moment
experience
-
the
way
it
is
reminding

nothing
you

way
there

entire
body
as
it
moves
through
every
inch
of
your
being
so
take
a
moment
now
to
let
everything
melt
away
as
you
tune
into
the
sound
of
the
rain
falling
all
around
you
open
your
ears
fully
as
the
rain
cleanses
your
body
mind
and
heart
if
you
notice
your
thoughts
wandering
at
any
point
simply
observe
this
wandering
as
a
tendency
of
the
mind
without
attaching
yourself
to
the
ideas
or
stories
it
is
drifting
too
it
is
easy
to
become
swept
away
by
the
current
of
the
mind
but
as
we
practice
gently
releasing
these
thoughts
streams
we
find
that
we
become
more
like
the
rock
bed
beneath
the
stream
still
solid
and
deeply
rooted
to
the
present
moment
now
open
your
awareness
more
intently
to
the
sounds
around
you
once
again
rain
continues
to
fall
washing
away
or
thoughts
and
stories
that
no
longer
serve
you
take
a
moment
now
to
imagine
yourself
lying
in
a
safe
space
that
is
open
to
the
elements
witness
yourself
resting
peacefully
here
perhaps
directly
on
the
earth
or
perhaps
supported
by
blankets
or
cushions
observe
the
area
around
you
someplace
with
lush
greenery
bright
blossoms
that
have
been
nourished
by
the
falling
rains
witness
the
way
the
rain
falls
upon
your
body
nurturing
you
much
the
same
way
that
it
supports
and
nourishes
the
plant
life
around
you
as
the
rain
falls
down
you
begin
to
grow
out
of
an
older
version
of
you
out
of
older
stories
out
of
old
attachments
and
out
of
any
confinements
imposed
on
you
by
the
mind
you
begin
to
blossom
the
rain
is
warm
against
your
skin
comforting
you
as
it
gently
Falls
take
a
moment
to
simply
observe
yourself
here
in
this
moment
witnessing
your
entire
being
resting
completely
at
peace
beneath
the
softness
of
rain
that
trickles
down
as
thoughts
arise
within
the
mind
observe
them
as
the
energy
bodies
that
do
not
belong
to
you
and
then
practice
raising
them
ever
so
slightly
so
that
they
come
to
rest
on
the
surface
of
your
skin
somewhere
along
your
forehead
and
as
the
rain
trickles
down
what
should
carry
these
thoughts
away
with
it
gliding
effortlessly
away
from
your
body
and
down
down
down
into
the
earth
the
earth
and
rain
paired
together
are
a
powerful
tool
of
transformation
the
earth
helps
to
ground
to
hold
energies
freeing
up
space
for
new
life
to
be
born
while
the
rain
helps
to
improve
flow
in
the
physical
world
water
continues
to
trickle
down
from
the
expansive
sky
taking
in
and
releasing
all
old
thoughts
stories
and
beliefs
that
might
continue
to
arise
breathe
through
an
open
heart
as
you
allow
whatever
arises
to
be
cleansed
if
fearful
worried
or
judgmental
thoughts
arise
about
this
process
of
release
or
about
your
intent
to
let
go
simply
observe
these
thoughts
as
their
own
life
forms
too
and
remind
yourself
that
they
are
separate
from
who
you
really
are
they
do
not
belong
to
you
and
they
no
longer
serve
you
just
open
your
heart
to
freedom
to
release
and
personal
growth
compassionately
inviting
the
old
to
be
returned
to
the
earth
for
processing
and
renewal
if
physical
tension
or
discomfort
arises
within
the
body
observe
that
too
and
then
gently
guide
the
tense
energy
towards
the
surface
of
the
body
as
the
rain
trickles
down
witness
it
carrying
away
any
and/or
discomfort
that
may
have
been
lodged
away
in
the
muscles
and
cells
there
is
no
need
to
carry
this
tension
any
longer
continue
to
ground
yourself
through
the
sound
of
the
falling
rain
allowing
it
to
be
your
anchor
into
the
present
moment
while
keeping
the
breath
deep
draw
your
awareness
to
the
heart
space
filling
it
with
love
and
ease
on
each
inhalation
and
freeing
it
of
all
tension
stress
and
concern
on
each
exhalation
through
your
exhalations
offer
up
all
remaining
tension
to
be
cleansed
by
the
rain
perhaps
sighing
deeply
as
you
feel
into
this
process
of
letting
go

into

once
again
observe
the
feel
of

coming
and

this
visualization
will
take
you
on
a
magical
inner
forest
journey
where
you
will
encounter
various
creatures
along
the
way
that
will
guide
you
further
along
the
path
towards
release
peace

for
openness
so

begin
this

carried
on
throughout
today
just
take
a

now
to
get
comfortable
adjust
yourself

want
to
use
further
cushions
or
blankets
or

your
pillow
exactly

like
[
Music

and
just
allow
the
body
to
softly
relax
taking
a
moment
to
feel
into
the
physical
environment
you
find
yourself
in
keeping
your
eyes
closed
allow
your
body
to
revel
in
the
physical
world
around
you
taking
pause
here
to
give
gratitude
to
this
very
moment
where
you
find
yourself
currently
in
so
I
invite
you
now
to
bring
your
awareness
to
your
breath
simply
by
observing
it
the
breath
draws
our
attention
to
the
present
moment
and
is
within
this
present
moment
that
everything
else
naturally
falls
away
allow
your
breath
to
be
your
anchor
guiding
you
through
the
silent
gaps
between
the
visualizations
of
this
meditation
[
Music

follow
your
breath
sound
natural
rhythm
watching
it
naturally
deepen
as
you
draw
your
attention
to
it
there
is
no
breathing
technique
required
here
only
an
honest
and
open
witnessing
as
you
watch
the
breath
allow
any
thoughts
or
judgments
to
fall
away
it
is
not
necessary
for
anything
within
your
experience
to
look
or
feel
a
certain
way
simply
begin
to
open
your
heart
to
the
simplicity
and
perfection
of
this
very
moment
allowing
yourself
to
be
exactly
as
you
are
right
now
also
keep
in
mind
that
with
the
all
meditations
you
are
always
in
control
the
power
to
visualize
to
manifest
and
to
embody
is
yours
and
yours
alone
so
allow
now
the
energy
of
the
forest
to
simply
guide
you
into
deeper
knowings
that
already
exists
within
you
know
that
whatever
sensations
feelings
or
thoughts
that
may
arise
are
entirely
natural
you
simply
witness
them
before
allowing
them
to
pass
drawing
yourself
further
into
the
enchanted
forest
you
are
about
to
discover
so
just
take
a
few
more
fully
aware
breaths
preparing
the
body
for
deep
rest
and
relief
of
all
stress
tension
and
anxiety
as
the
mind
and
body
softens
further
into
a
state
of
tranquility
slowly
allow
visions
of
a
dense
forest
to
grow
within
your
mind
's
eye
at
the
foot
of
this
dream
the
richness
of
complex
soil
systems
form
the
ground
beneath
you
and
out
of
this
magical
earth
sprouts
elaborate
greenery
trees
shrubs
flowers
and
vines
allow
the
wildness
of
this
forest
to
grow
and
then
eventually
steady
out
drawing
you
into
the
lush
beauty
and
complete
stillness
of
the
forest
take
a
few
deep
breaths
here
allowing

to
fill
the

of
your
lungs

with
each
inhalation
notice

becoming
infused
with
nature

healing
powers
and
with
each
breath
out
witness
yourself
releasing
some
sensations
of
stress
or
tension
into
the
healing
air
around
you
binding
yourself
now
standing
or
sitting
within
an
opening

can
harm
you
you
open
yourself
up
quite
naturally
to
the
messages
that
come
your
way
in
the
stillness
of
this
moment
this
deep
forest
within
you
hear
a
gentle
stirring
in
the
dense
woods
before
you
slowly
and
with
grace
a
deer
emerges
into
the
opening
you
resting
she
is
gentle
and
soft
footed
presenting
no
threat
to
your
well-being
the
two
of
you

one
another
with

incredible
openness
that
permeates

core
your

see
that
she
is
here
to
bestow
her

this
deer
grants
you
the
ability
to
harness
your
intuitive
capabilities
within
this
reawakening
of
intuition
you
know
it
is
a
safe
place
to
gently
release
the
entanglements
of
the
mind
that
may
be
fogging
over
your
clearest
visions
you
might
like
to
take
a
few
deep
breaths
here
allowing
the
mind
to
be
released
on
each
exhalation
the
deer
departs
lowly
and
you
were
left
with
her
softness
and
the
trace
of
her
silent
footing
you
begin
to
breathe
more
deeply
and
the
mind
begins
to
loosen
its
grasp
all
of
the
breath
here
for
a
few
moments
allowing
it
to
carry
you
deep
into
the
richness
of
this
present
moment
with
each
inhalation
you
are
nourished
and
with
each
exhalation
you
are
freed
from
the
confines
of
the
mind
you
rest
once
more
in
the
peaceful
opening
of
the
woods
this
time
an
animal
makes
itself
seen
not
from
its
footing
on
the
earth
floor
but
rather
as
it
soars
above
the
dense
canopy
the
eagle
flies
overhead
with
strength
courage
and
clear-sightedness
you
watch
in
awe
as
it
flies
between
earth
and
the
cosmos
as
if
it
were
the
king
of
this
forest
or
the
king
of
the
open
air
the
Eagle
comes
as
a
messenger
to
reveal
a
human
connection
to
the
divine
by
way
of
its
appearance
here
it
bestows
upon
you
the
gift
of
power
of
healing
and
of
wisdom
you
begin
to
feel
divinely
connected
to
the
forest
to
these
animals
and
to
the
energy
that
swirls
around
you
to
spirit
or
to
the
universe
knowing
that
you
are
supported
by
something
higher
than
yourself
you
begin
to
release
further
into
this
present
moment
stress
or
anxiety
carried
in
the
body
or
mind
continue
to
melt
away
you
come
the
sense
that
within
the
grand
scheme
of
the
universe
the
tension
that
you
carry
no
longer
serves
you
you
release
it
gently
into
the
air
with
each
out
breath
as
the
eagle
slowly
disappears
from
sight
you
are
left
with
an
awareness
of
this
magical
connection
between
body
mind
and
spirit
so
in
this
moment
continue
to
breathe
mindfully
you
draw
yourself
again
and
again
breath
by
breath
into
this
present
moment
within
the
space
of
this
forest
you
continue
to
breathe
in
the
healing
air
releasing
that
which
no
longer
serves
you
to
the
woods
to
be
transformed
you
find
yourself
resting
more
comfortably
and
with
greater
ease
in
this
present
moment
[
Music
]
your
connection
to
the
forest
is
deepening
as
you
become
more
settled
within
its
environment
you
feel
inspired
by
the
animals
and
greenery
that
nourishes
you
here
and
you
are
fully
open
to
whatever
may
come
knowing
that
nothing
can
harm
you
in
any
way
just
before
you
an
agile
Lynx
emerges
from
the
woods
she
's
quiet
and
contemplative
and
she
watches
you
with
knowing
eyes
the
Lynx
has
incredible
insights
and
strong
intuition
his
highly
instinctive
encourages
you
to
trust
your
own
instincts
in
the
same
way
she
bears
the
gift
of
solitude
of
patience
and
of
caution
the
Lynx
remind
you
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
in
this
instant
all
that
she
asks
is
for
you
to
pay
attention
with
discernment
slowly
your
path
unfolds
itself
with
her
grace
you
'll
gently
be
guided
along
the
way
or
that
you
are
required
to
do
now
in
this
moment
is
to
relax
and
listen
as
she
disappears
into
the
density
of
the
forest
the
Lynx
leaves
you
in
solitude
the
air
is
quiet
now
and
you
are
beginning
to
revel
in
the
stillness
and
silence
that
is
within
you
as
you
tune
in
now
gently
following
your
breath
you
come
into
contact
with
the
joy
and
freedom
within
this
very
moment
as
you
gently
follow
your
breath
you
come
into
contact
with
this
very
moment
what
emotions
do
you
feel
here
you
might
feel
joy
you
might
feel
sadness
you
might
not
feel
anything
and
this
is
all
perfectly
okay
at
this
moment
just
allow
the
outside
world
to
melt
away
as
you
experience
a
deeper
sense
of
peace
within
sink
into
this
moment
a
little
bit
further
using
your
breath
to
continually
ground
you
in
this
present
moment
remind
yourself
that
with
each
inhalation
you
are
deeply
nourished
and
with
each
exhalation
you
softly
unnaturally
release
any
stress
or
tension
[
Music
]
as
the
light
begins
to
fall
away
behind
the
trees
a
calming
energy
comes
over
the
forest
within
the
center
of
it
you
feel
yourself
to
be
quiet
at
home
connected
deeply
with
everything
that
it
holds
before
the
light
fades
away
you
catch
sight
of
something
moving
delicately
and
gently
through
the
air
above
the
most
vibrant
butterfly
you
of
ever
witnessed
litters
there
is
dancing
peacefully
and
radiantly
through
the
air
around
her
a
complete
embodiment
of
her
own
radiance
she
carries
the
message
of
joy
lightness
and
transformation
the
butterfly
is
not
always
been
this
way
before
opening
her
wings
she
spent
a
period
of
time
within
a
hardened
shell
during
this
period
of
non
movement
she
transformed
bringing
her
to
a
place
where
she
is
now
littering
through
the
lush
forest
very
much
alive
as
the
night
falls
the
butterfly
leaves
you
with
the
feeling
of
inspiration
and
a
growing
faith
in
the
unfolding
journey
held
within
the
innate
wisdom
of
this
ever-changing
journey
you
soften
ever
more
deeply
into
the
unknown
see
if
you
can
allow
all
stress
and
tension
to
melt
away
just
trusting
in
this
moment
a
natural
flow
of
the
universe
light
turns
to
darkness
and
still
you
stay
there
within
this
forest
you
are
at
peace
here
Elden
nourished
by
the
free
air
around
you
as
you
breathe
you
begin
to
release
any
tension
that
might
be
still
tucked
away
within
this
body
now
lying
comfortably
on
the
forest
floor
you
scan
the
body
gently
allowing
any
sensation
of
discomfort

is
warm
on
this
summer
night
and
your
body
is
completely
at
ease

notice
the
faintest
sounds
of
the
forest
as
they
lull
you
to
sleep

before
fading
into
a
peaceful
slumber
you
hear
a
wolf
howling
in
the
distance
there
is
no
fear
within
you
at
hearing
this
sound

you
feel
a
divine
connection

down

offers
us
a
chance
to
release

blessing
and
benefits
of
the
Setting
Sun
and
the
stillness
and
stability
of
the
earth
beneath
you
in
this
very
moment
[
Music
]
the
moment
we
are
born
into
this
human
form
we
begin
to
accumulate
ideas
about
who
we
are
and
what
we
are
capable
of
these
ideas
turn
into
beliefs
which
turn
into
actions
that
create
our
reality
however
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
we
are
not
whatever
our
thoughts
have
limited
us
to
be
when
we
start
to
unravel
a
complex
web
of
stories
we
have
told
ourselves
again
and
again
we
free
up
space
for
our
truest
and
highest
self
to
shine
through
if
the
mind
attempts
to
analyze
or
rationalize
your
stories
I
invite
you
to
gently
let
go
of
this
mental
action
as
you
move
into
the
heart
space
old
beliefs
will
naturally
begin
to
unravel
themselves
exposing
what
exists
deep
beneath
the
surface
of
who
you
think
you
are
so
draw
your
breath
into
the
heart
now
each
time
limiting
thoughts
arise
about
who
you
are
where
you
have
been
or
where
you
are
going
gently
guide
these
notions
down
to
the
heart
to
be
transformed
as
you
witness
them
arising
silently
repeat
these
thoughts
I
see
you
and
I
release
you
I
see
you
and
I
release
you
I
see
you
and
I
release
you
each
time
you
release
preconceived
notions
about
who
you
are
you
free
up
empty
space
for
new
life
to
emerge
from
without
seeding
any
new
ideas
just
yet
take
some
time
to
simply
revel
in
the
silence
and
the
emptiness
of
the
world
within
and
it
's
a
soothing
emptiness
that
grows
more
apparent
as
each
limiting
notion
of
who
you
are
untangles
itself
from
your
core
[
Music

draw
your
awareness
to
your
stomach
noticing
the
way
the
breath
causes
your
belly
to
rise
and
to
fall
on
the
breath
out
alongside
each
full
breath
cycle
continue
to
ground
yourself
in
this
moment
through
the
breath
allowing
it
to
remind
you
of
what
is
most
real
that
is
your
direct
experience
of
this
present
moment
now
as
you
breathe
focus
your
attention
on
the
following
words
helping
you
to
deeply
reaffirm
the
belief
that
you
are
far
more
than
any
limiting
self
notions
and
that
you
are
capable
of
achieving
your
truest
dreams
and
goals
so
alongside
each
breath
silently
whisper
to
yourself
I
create
my
life
from
within
I
create
my
life
from
within
I
create
my
life
from
within
take
a
few
moments
of
silence
now
to
sink
deeply
into
the
truth
of
these
words
repeating
them
softly
and
slowly
begin
to
notice
your
entire
body
becoming
more
relaxed
and
then
draw
your
awareness
to
your
toes
very
slowly
begin
to
carry
your
attention
upwards
throughout
the
body
and
as
you
pass
each
area
of
your
physical
being
observe
any
areas
where
they
may
be
lingering
tension
or
tightness
and
silently
whisper
I
see
you
and
I
release
you
to
each
area
that
requires
your
loving
attention
once
you
have
reached
the
top
of
your
head
bring
the
entire
physical
body
into
your
awareness
the
mind
included
once
again
quietly
compassionately
and
non-judgmentally
repeat
these
words
I
see
you
and
I
release
you
I
see
you
and
I
release
you
I
see
you
and
I
release
you
a
deep
sense
of
lightness
and
freedom
will
begin
to
overcome
you
just
take
a
few
deep
breaths
into
this
sensation
allowing
it
to
run
through
your
entire
being
now
with
your
highest
self
quietly
radiating
outwards
I
invite
you
to
begin
to
consider
what
new
version
of
yourself
is
waiting
to
emerge
what
dreams
or
goals
are
ready
to
be
brought
to
fruition
take
a
few
moments
of
silence
here
as
you
allow
images
and
dreams
to
come
to
you
there
is
no
need
to
actively
seek
anything
out
there
is
also
no
right
or
wrong
ideas
that
might
come
to
the
surface
simply
allow
your
heart
to
speak
allowing
its
purest
and
highest
intent
to
come
to
your
awareness
through
words
and
images
observe
them
as
they
arise
[

also
becoming
aware
of
any
attempt
the
mind
might
make
to
intervene
refrain
from
making
plans
from
assessing
plausibility
from
arguing
or
judging
what
arises
just
allow
yourself
to
unconditionally
explore
whatever
comes
up
for
you
now
begin
to
visualize
yourself
in
a
small
stretch
of
open
space
in
the
middle
of
a
forest
observe
the
wildlife
that
flourishes
around
you
observe
the
colors
the
textures
the
sounds
and
the
aromas
open
all
of
your
senses
to
this
space
feeling
into
the
wild
freedom

you
standing
firmly
rooted
into
the
earth
you
reach
into
your
pocket
and
pull
out
three
seeds
just
take
a
moment
to
observe
these
seeds
noting
how
miraculous
seeds
really
are
these
tiny
nuggets
of
material
hold
the
power
and
incredible
potential
to
transform
into
something
completely
different
than
what
they
might
appear
to
be
in
their
present
form
and
you
too
have
seeds
inside
of
you
that
are
waiting
to
be
planted
so
take
a
moment
to
bring
to
mind
three
intentions
of
your
highest
self
of
your
purest
heart
consider
the
words
and
images
that
came
to
you
in
the
silent
and
spacious
void
created
after
limiting
thoughts
and
beliefs
had
been
released
what
are
your
highest
goals
who
are
you
ready
to
become
now
with
the
first
intention
in
mind
silently
whisper
your
vision
to
one
of
your
seeds
take
a
moment
to
thoughtfully
plant
this
intention
into
the
seed
and
then
as
you
bend
down
dig
a
small
hole
with
your
bare
hands
once
you
have
prepared
the
soil
for
your
first
seed
place
the
seed
in
the
space
created
and
gently
cover
it
up
with
the
fertile
earth
take
a
moment
to
bless
this
seed
offering
it
the
energy
it
needs
to
blossom
into
full
potential
and
then
come
to
rest
in
silence
once
again
in
this
opening
in
the
forest
draw
your
second
intention
to
mind
and
bestow
it
upon
your
second
seed
crouching
down
once
again
create
a
space
in
the
earth
for
your
seed
to
grow
roots
plant
the
seed
and
then
cover
it
with
soil
offer
this
newly
planted
intention
all
of
the
love
and
support
it
will
need
to
grow
into
fruition
and
then
return
to
silent
awareness
of
the
enchanted
forest
you
are
Hin
finally
observe
the
third
seed
resting
in
the
palm
of
your
hand
and
whisper
your
third
and
final
intention
or
dream
to
it
[
Music

breathe
through
the
heart
as
you
bless
this
seed
with
unconditional
love
and
then
as
you
did
for
the
rest
dig
a
small
hole
in
the
earth
and
then
plant
your
seed
as
you
cover
the
hole
up
with
rich
soil
observe
a
lightness
coming
over
your
entire
being
your
dreams
have
now
been
seeded
so
take
a
few
final
moments
to
send
positive
vibrations
to
the
earth
and
the
seeds
that
are
planted
there
knowing
that
change
is
happening
in
this
very
moment
witness
the
body
relaxing
and
the
breath
deepening
as
a
subtle
transformation
frees
you
of
whatever
once
held
you
back
now
gently
release
the
image
of
yourself
in
this
fertile
forest
knowing
that
you
will
come
back
here
again
and
again
night
after
night
to
plant
these
energetic
seeds
of
your
highest
intention
keep
these
intentions
in
mind
for
replanting
but
also
allow
flexibility
in
your
intentions
as
complex
human
beings
we
are
multifaceted
creatures
with
numerous
ways
of
expressing
ourselves
and
of
living
our
lives
the
ways
in
which
you
can
live
wholeheartedly
are
boundless
the
possibilities
are
infinite

to
your
breath

its

rhythm
to
carry
you
into
a
state
of
deep
relaxation
there
is
nothing
left
for
you
to
do
nothing
for
you
to
visualize
so
allow
all
thoughts
to
melt
away
surrender
your
dreams
to
the
world
around
you
knowing
that
the
universe
has
already

your
calls
your

transformation
will
continue
to
unfold

your
attention
on
your
breath

may
alternatively
choose
to
reaffirm
the
truth
that
the
power
to
recreate

minutes

journey
through
four
different
environments
exploring
peace
and
relaxation
in
the
context
of
each
one
of
them

calm
sense
of
expectation
to
rise
in
your
mind
and
set
an
intention
to
rest
deeply
and
completely
feel
your
body
relaxed
more
than
it
has
in
a
long
while
all
the
tension
in
your
body
dissolving
bit
by
bit

muscle
in
your
body
relax

those
in

your

your
lips
or
jaw
the
back
of
your

the
surface
around

's
begin
our
meditation
so
lying
down
keeping
your
back
straight
as
much
as
you
can
feel
your
body
becoming
more
serene
you
are
still
and
peaceful
in
this
breath
and
the
next
as
you
relax
you
begin
to
hear
the
crash
of
water
in
the
distance
as
you
sink
a
little
deeper
into
relaxation
it
grows
louder
until
you
yourself
are
standing
on
the
banks
of
an
enormous
waterfall
it
is
morning
and
the
sunlight
catches
the
water
as
it
falls
creating
thousands
of
tiny
rainbows
in
the
spray
around
the
cliff
the
rumble
of
moving
water
is
at
once
both
soothing
and
awe-inspiring
a
symphony
of
Earth
's
very
essence
tumbling
around
you
take
a
moment
to
breathe
in
this
majesty

as
you
look
more
closely
at
the
waterfall
bill
the
cool
mist
envelop
your
face
leaving
dewy
droplets
on
your
cheeks
and
Florida
feel
the
vitality
and
power
of
this
place
all
around
you
in
the
warmth
of
the
cliff
bases
the
gentle
glow
of
the
Sun
the
frothy
water
around
the
Falls
notice
yourself
becoming
karma
beginning
to
let
go
of
your
worries
and
physical
tension
allow
yourself
to
breathe
letting
the
rush
of
the
water
guide
you
into
a
deeper
relaxation
allow
yourself
to
feel
the
slow
transitions
from
inhale
to
exhale
and
from
exhale
to
inhale
note
the
tiny
delicate
paws
in
the
center
of
these
transitions
that
space
where
inhalation
ends
but
before
exhalation
begins
breathe
as
deeply
or
as
shallowly
as
comfortable
for
you
your
chest
moving
rhythmically
and
effortlessly
as
you
sink
a
little
deeper
into
relaxation
letting
go
of
any
worry
or
stress
if
at
any
time
your
mind
wanders
simply
bring
it
gently
back
to
your
breath
a
calming
gentle
process
of
bringing
air
into
your
lungs
feel
any
tension
in
your
body
lift
away
with
every
breath
you
take
nothing
can
hurt
you
here
enjoy
these
next
few
moments
next
to
the
waterfall
letting
your
worries
dissolve
under
the
relentless
rumble
of
fresh
rainwater

as
you
notice
the
sounds
of
the
meditation
begin
to
change
allow
your
imagination
to
follow
your
feelings
to
follow
creating
around
you
a
magnificent
sandy
beach
waves
break
in
crystalline
sprays
and
the
call
of
seagulls
eases
your
mind
smell
the
sharp
tang
of
salt
and
the
warm
dustiness
of
hot
sand
let
your
shoulders
droop
and
your
fora
done
crease
in
the
background
you
can
hear
the
wash
of
the
ocean
waves
breaking
on
the
beach
you
can
watch
the
water
if
you
like
or
close
your
imaginary
eyes
and
simply
dwell
in
the
presence
of
your
other
senses
breathe
and
listen
let
everything
else
go
so
much
of
meditation
is
the
practice
of
letting
go
of
accepting
that
you
can
not
control
everything
around
you
of
welcoming
in
the
infinite
glorious
possibilities
and
opportunities
that
are
waiting
for
you
letting
go
of
your
conscious
discipline
your
task
oriented
nature
is
the
gateway
to
relaxation
so
taking
a
breath
in
and
exhale
letting
go
of
the
need
to
control
your
experience
just
for
a
few
minutes
allow
yourself
to
feel
whatever
arises
letting
go
of
everything
negative
and
treasuring
the
beauty
of
this
moment
's
experience
as
your
body
lets
go
of
any
tension
your
breath
slows
down
and
it
may
deepen
just
a
slight
bit
simply
follow
its
rhythm
listening
to
the
quiet
in
and
out
of
air
in
your
lungs
if
you
would
like
match
your
breath
to
the
tempo
of
the
sea
nearby
following
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
waves
behind
whatever
feels
most
comfortable
most
relaxing
and
embrace
it
this
is
your
chance
to
discover
and
choose
whatever
you
need
to
rest
most
fully
and
again
as
the
music
and
sounds
of
this
meditation
begin
to
change
allow
yourself
to
be
transported
to
the
banks
of
a
freshwater
brook
or
river
where
fish
jump
and
the
sunlight
glints
on
the
wet
rocks
as
you
take
a
deep
inhale
you
breathe
in
the
burbling
sound
of
water
on
stones
and
the
gentle
sigh
of
wind
in
the
young
tree
boughs
take
another
deep
breath
and
then
release
it
relishing
the
warmth
of
the
air
that
leaves
your
body
feel
your
feet
sink
into
the
soft
grass
of
the
riverbank
and
notice
the
bright
green
color
of
early
spring
if
you
would
like
you
may
dip
your
foot
into
the
stream
noticing
the
way
the
water
washes
over
your
toes
cooling
your
skin
you
can
hear
a
few
honeybees
buzzing
about
enjoying
the
landscape
as
much
as
you
are
you
know
that
the
bees
will
not
harm
you
and
so
you
can
continue
to
enjoy
the
gentle
harmony
they
make
a
soft
sound
that
sets
off
the
silver
tinkling
music
of
the
creek
a
little
way
in
front
of
you
a
butterfly
flutters
on
the
breeze
dipping
and
soaring
with
the
invisible
current
of
the
wind
you
hold
out
your
hand
and
it
floats
closer
to
you
landing
on
your
skin
with
an
almost
imperceptible
touch
allow
yourself
to
lay
down
on
the
riverbanks
feeling
the
way
the
grass
molds
around
your
body
supporting
your
back
and
neck
so
you
can
relax
more
completely
above
you
you
can
see
a
fluffy
white
cloud
a
clear
blue
sky
all
around
you
are
the
sounds
of
nature
peaceful
and
rhythmic
your
thoughts
disappeared
replaced
by
this
music
of
nature
you
can
feel
all
the
aches
and
pains
in
your
body
dissolve
away
as
you
sink
a
little
deeper
into
the
warm
grass
relaxed
and
at
peace
in
this
beautiful
landscape
give
yourself
permission
to
enjoy
it
as
you
breathe
you
feel
yourself
growing
lighter
more
relaxed
almost
as
if
the
stresses
and
tensions
of
the
day
are
being
washed
away
in
the
cheerful
sound
of
the
river
breathe
in
welcoming
inspiration
and
peace
breathe
out
exhaling
worry
and
fear
this
is
your
time
embrace
it
now
in
these
next
few
moments
and
now
as
the
music
and
sounds
around
you
change
one
small
breathe
in
and
find
yourself
on
the
path
of
a
majestic
and
ancient
forest
the
trail
through
the
forest
is
verdant
lined
with
the
carpet
of
the
grass
your
feet
sink
into
it's
slightly
brushing
against
the
soft
coolness
of
its
surface
birds
sing
in
the
trees
a
symphony
of
natural
beauty
some
chirp
back
and
forth
others
trill
melodies
into
the
wind
a
gentle
breeze
sways
in
the
trees
and
the
soft
touch
of
its
passing
soothes
your
skin
the
sunshine
is
less
bright
here
dappled
and
soft
instead
of
its
usual
brash
gold
the
air
feels
a
little
cooler
a
little
moister
than
what
you
are
accustomed
to
and
yet
it
is
a
soothing
coolness
filled
with
the
scent
of
dry
leaves
wet
bark
and
soft
green
moss

as
you
walk
further
and
deeper
into
the
forest
the
trees
become
larger
their
trunks
wider
and
spaced
further
apart
in
the
resulting
space
hangs
a
mantle
of
pearly
fog
floating
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
as
you
walk
your
legs
stir
the
fog
and
it
swirls
around
you
gauzy
tendrils
lazy
soft
against
your
skin
birdsong
accompanies
you
along
your
journey
lifting
your
spirit
and
soothing
your
body
with
its
innocent
sounds
let
your
self
marvel
at
the
size
of
these
trees
as
wide
around
as
dining
tables
and
almost
taller
than
your
eyes
can
see
smell
the
dampness
of
believes
and
dirt
underneath
them
nourishing
and
protecting
their
roots
imagine
how
far
these
tree
's
roots
must
extend
into
the
earth
in
order
to
remain
sturdy
and
upright
above
all
allow
the
nature's
music
to
guide
you
into
further
relaxation
as
you
breathe
deeply
watching
the
sunlight
meander
back
and
forth
as
the
trees
sway
in
the
breeze
bring
your
attention
to
yourself
are
you
holding
any
tension
or
is
there
any
pain
in
your
body
are
you
carrying
or
holding
on
to
something
in
your
back
your
neck
or
your
shoulders
is
there
tension
in
your
hips
or
perhaps
the
way
you
squeeze
your
eyelid
shut
how
does
it
feel
to
be
you
right
now
you
are
still
and
tranquil
United
with
this
peaceful
an
ageless
environment
feel
your
body
relaxing
as
you
breathe
a
little
deeper
letting
go
of
anything
that
might
distract
you
let
yourself
focus
completely
on
the
beauty
of
the
forest
sense
it
feel
what
it
's
like
welcoming
the
harmony
and
stillness
that
accompanies
it

your

to
travel
across
your
body
noticing
how
deeply
your
muscles

tendons
have
relaxed
since
now
the
space
between
your

the

dark
in

up

up

in

you
blink

is
a
sign
that

is
coming
to
you
and
one
more
time
deep
breath
in
and
as

breathe
out
let
your

close

movement
occurring
in

movement
is
a
relaxed
state
of
awareness
coming
to
you

state
of
internal
awareness
where

powers
are
increased
the
state
will
lead
you
into

the
heaviness
of
your
eyelids
as
you
relax
the
muscles
around
your
eyes
your
face
and
neck
are
so
relaxed
that
you
could
n't
even
tense
your
muscles
if
you
tried
you
may
even
feel
as
if
your
eyelids
have
been
glued
shut
or
locked
together
and
it
feels
great
to
have
them
closed
they
are
feeling
like
they
really
do
n't
want
to
open
you
'll
find
that
when
you
try
to
open
them
they
feel
locked
together
you
notice
the
fluttering
of
your
eyes
once
more
and
you
go
deeper
into
relaxation
you
'll
find
the
harder
you
try
to
open
them
the
more
they
feel
heavy
and
you
feel
drowsy
and
you
go
deeper
you
are
surrendering
into
your
drowsiness

beneath

boundaries
are
falling
away
the
boundaries
that
appear
to
separate
your
body
from
the
space
around
it
are
disintegrating

take
in
a

breath
of
air
merging
what
is
inside

with
what
is
outside
of

take
in
another

below

welcome
my
friends
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
thank
you
for
joining
me
on
this
sleep
meditation
golden
stars
astral
heights
meditation
this
meditation
is
unlike
any
other
meditation
I
have
previously
done
as
this
meditation
is
being
guided
with
the
help
of
my
guided
spiritual
adviser
David
[
Music
]
so
I
asked
you
to
find
a
comfortable
position
lying
down
preferably
with
your
back
straight
wriggling
around
finding
yourself
finding
that
space
where
you
can
lay
comfortably
and
breathe
with
ease
begin
the
meditation
by
taking
in
three
deep
breaths
in
through
the
nose
sending
that
breath
all
the
way
down
to
the
lower
belly
area
and
releasing
letting
go
just
do
this
a
few
more
times
and
when
you
are
done
returning
your
breathing
back
to
a
comfortable
rhythm
that
is
natural
for
you
I
need
to
try
to
change
it
just
be
with
your
breath
enjoy
the
sensation
of
that
breath
as
it
passes
through
your
nostrils
sending
it
down
and
feeling
it
as
it
releases
through
your
nostrils
once
more
if
at
any
time
during
this
meditation
your
thoughts
wander
away
from
my
voice
you
simply
just
have
to
acknowledge
that
thought
and
your
job
is
simply
to
bring
your
focus
back
to
your
breathing
in
and
out
this
meditation
does
not
have
to
be
complex
in
any
way
our
job
is
simply
to
allow
our
mind
to
fall
away
to
give
it
rest
for
the
day
whilst
we
allow
our
heart
and
spirit
to
open
and
surrender
[
Music

so
for
these
next
few
moments
simply
being
with
your
breath
you
may
feel
your
stomach
rising
and
falling
maybe
the
sides
of
your
belly
rising
and
falling
or
your
lower
back
area
expanding
on
the
breath
in
contracting
on
the
breath
out
[

really
connect
with
your
breathing
just
be
here
and
enjoy
this
process
and
I
will
return
in
a
few
moments
time
[
Music

I
would
like
you
now
to
visualize
a
golden
light
that
is
pouring
in
from
the
top
of
your
head
and
it
's
beginning
to
fill
you
and
pour
all
the
way
down
your
entire
body
it
's
a
shining
golden
light
and
as
it
pours
in
it
soothes
you
calms
your
mind
and
relaxes
you
feel
it
as
it
travels
down
your
face
relaxing
your
facial
muscles
your
eyebrows
your
forward
nose
and
cheeks
and
your
eyes
and
eye
sockets
just
allowing
them
to
feel
heavy
and
relaxed
down
into
your
throat
and
your
shoulders
and
now
filling
your
arms
down
to
your
elbows
your
forearms
wrists
and
right
down
to
your
hands
and
fingertips
you
may
even
feel
a
tingling
sensation
within
your
fingers
and
if
you
do
just
allow
that
to
be
you
do
n't
have
to
judge
that
or
try
to
name
that
just
accept
that
as
it
is
and
coming
back
up
your
harms
your
shoulders
and
down
now
that
the
golden
light
continues
to
spill
down
to
your
chest
area
your
stomach
and
your
shoulder
blades
and
your
spine
running
down
your
spinal
cord
releasing
all
tension
and
allowing
you
to
relax
deeply
[

the
golden
light
is
continuing
to
pour
in
and
runs
down
now
to
your
pelvis

your

your
buttocks
just

tips
of
each

to
unlearn
what
you
've
learned
today
to
forgive
any

today

release
them
because
just

pause
through

at

you
begin

your

the

that
you
live
in
the

below
twinkling
looking

had
seemed
oh
so
trivial
now
almost
non-existent

drift
into
this

a

that
is
set
aside

reflect
on
what
really
is
important
in
your

to
you
over

meditation
hello
and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
over
the
course
of
the
next
30
minutes
or
so
we
will
find
stability
and
groundedness
returning
from
whatever
thoughts
hopes
and
worries
phoebus
from
feeling
in
the
present
moment
you
might
choose
to
listen
to
this
meditation
before
bed
right
when
you
wake
up
in
the
morning
or
as
a
break
in
an
otherwise
really
busy
day
however
you
choose
to
approach
this
recording
is
absolutely
right
for
you
just
allow
your
eyes
to
close
your
breathing
to
deepen
and
your
body
to
relax
make
sure
you're
in
a
comfortable
position
where
you
wo
n't
be
disturbed
for
the
next
30
minutes
or
so
and
taking
three
deep
breaths
to
begin
with
breathing
all
the
way
and
sending
that
breath
all
the
way
down
to
your
diaphragm
area
holding
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
letting
it
all
come
out
release
all
your
hair
and
do
this
another
two
times
as
you
breathe
a
little
deeper
imagine
now
that
you
were
standing
in
a
grassy
field
tiny
green
plants
sparkling
with
Jun
cushioning
your
feet
with
their
soft
leaves
and
above
you
the
sky
is
spotless
blue
and
you
can
hear
a
few
birds
singing
around
you
it
is
morning
and
it
's
the
start
of
a
beautiful
day
as
you
stand
in
this
place
allow
yourself
to
truly
feel
all
that
is
around
you
[
Music
]
notice
the
temperature
of
the
air
on
any
exposed
skin
the
sunshine
or
wind
against
your
body
[
Music
]
take
note
of
the
smells
damp
soil
dewy
leaves
[
Music
]
can
you
hear
any
birds
possibly
crickets
or
perhaps
honeybees
[
Music
]
gaze
into
the
distance
allowing
your
imagination
to
sharpen
the
scenery
around
you
into
an
intensely
detailed
beautiful
landscape
and
then
when
you
are
ready
allow
yourself
to
feel
what
it
is
like
within
your
own
body
at
this
very
moment
where
do
your
muscles
and
tendons
hold
pain
or
tension
do
you
hold
your
face
taut
or
your
shoulders
slumped
I
'd
like
you
to
take
these
few
moments
and
truly
notice
how
you
feel
treating
yourself
with
kindness
not
not
trying
to
change
anything
this
is
a
snapshot
of
you
a
portrait
captured
in
this
moment
just
give
yourself
permission
to
become
familiar
with
it
[
Music
]
and
now
as
you
become
attune
to
your
body
allow
your
consciousness
to
turn
to
your
mind
as
best
as
you
are
able
allowing
yourself
to
observe
your
brain
its
thought
patterns
and
impulses
without
actively
participating
in
them
[
Music
]
it
's
almost
like
you
are
viewing
a
sporting
match
or
a
television
show
you
can
see
what
is
happening
you
can
point
things
out
or
cheer
on
certain
thoughts
but
you
have
no
need
to
change
or
influence
though
at
this
moment
you
're
simply
watching
the
move
past
in
whatever
shapes
or
patterns
they
happen
to
take
on
[
Music
]
if
you
find
yourself
getting
sucked
into
a
particular
dilemma
or
worry
simply
exhale
blow
it
out
and
bring
your
consciousness
back
to
spectating
observing
as
you
observe
your
thoughts
you
will
notice
that
certain
hopes
reminders
and
even
worries
continue
to
appear
some
may
tempt
you
more
than
others
some
may
be
easier
to
let
go
of
pay
attention
to
the
persistent
ones
and
if
they
appear
again
ask
yourself
if
these
thoughts
manifest
themselves
in
your
body
you
may
notice
anger
in
your
chest
or
stress
your
hips
but
no
matter
how
these
emotions
present
themselves
take
heed
oftentimes
almost
chronic
pain
is
nothing
more
than
a
learned
response
to
a
series
of
emotions
take
these
few
moments
now
and
simply
stay
with
what
you
are
feeling
allowing
yourself
to
be
conscious
of
the
way
it
affects
your
mind
and
physical
body
[
Music
]
when
you
were
ready
taking
a
deep
breath
and
exhale
sighing
out
all
the
frustration
tension
and
destructiveness
within
you
do
not
be
afraid
to
make
a
sound
simply
allow
your
exhale
to
wash
it
out
of
you
cleansing
your
body
in
mind
like
a
warm
healing
wave
I
'd
like
you
to
do
this
five
more
times
noticing
how
you
become
progressively
more
relaxed
increasingly
more
relieved
with
each
passing
moment
feeling
yourself
becoming
present
anchored
in
the
gentle
endless
rhythm
of
your
own
respiration
and
now
as
you
stand
in
this
lush
green
field
imagine
that
your
feet
are
growing
roots
majestic
powerful
roots
that
grow
into
the
soil
holding
you
Ferland
strong
in
this
idyllic
place
see
these
roots
going
down
as
they
reach
further
into
the
ground
they
split
off
forming
a
vast
network
of
tendrils
that
will
hold
you
firm
in
even
the
greatest
weeds
roots
that
will
nourish
and
protect
you
through
even
the
darkest
winters
and
stronger
storms
[
Music
]
these
roots
extend
hundreds
of
feet
into
the
dirt
growing
around
rocks
and
boulders
passing
through
soil
that
has
not
seen
the
Sun
for
many
centuries
they
cross
the
paths
of
other
tree
's
roots
touching
them
gently
in
greedy
growing
together
yet
respecting
each
trees
individual
space
and
root
paths
you
are
rooted
in
the
most
beautiful
place
your
face
turned
toward
the
warm
Sun
and
your
roots
nestled
in
cool
rich
soil
and
now
as
you
take
your
next
breath
in
imagine
that
your
legs
and
torso
are
being
wrapped
gently
in
bark
a
soft
form-fitting
covering
that
will
protect
you
from
all
the
hazards
that
life
has
to
offer
you
you
know
that
you
may
return
to
your
human
form
whenever
you
would
like
and
so
this
is
a
soothing
process
almost
as
if
you
were
being
draped
in
the
softest
blanket
imaginable
you
wiggle
your
toes
peeling
your
roots
bar
below
ground
nestling
into
the
dirt
you
shrug
your
shoulders
feeling
the
comfortable
durability
of
bark
all
around
you
you
have
walked
this
earth
for
many
years
experiencing
the
joys
and
challenges
that
each
day
has
to
bring
you
you
have
earned
your
bark
the
golden
cloak
shot
through
with
silver
that
warms
you
every
day
of
your
life
breathe
a
little
deeper
and
listen
to
the
sounds
of
birds
and
nature
all
around
you
you
stretch
your
arms
out
and
as
you
do
they
fan
into
branches
branches
white
with
a
spring
whiteness
of
apple
blossoms
this
time
in
your
life
is
busy
stressful
even
but
in
this
space
you
are
able
to
reach
for
the
heavens
celebrating
the
joy
and
space
in
every
present
moment
as
you
inhale
notice
the
delicate
aroma
of
the
small
white
flowers
[
Music
]
breathe
in
the
smell
of
sunshine
and
soil
and
growth
and
when
you
are
ready
turn
your
head
to
take
in
the
sights
all
around
you
as
you
look
around
you
realize
that
you
are
not
standing
in
a
field
you
are
standing
in
an
orchard
a
nearly
endless
community
of
trees
right
with
the
hopeful
flowers
of
spring
around
your
trunks
long
green
grass
grows
a
rock
bright
and
in
your
branches
bluebirds
see
you
are
not
the
only
tree
you
are
a
part
of
a
community
a
beautiful
and
vibrant
orchard
that
grows
together
so
often
our
lives
feel
as
if
they
are
only
about
us
moments
of
pain
and
suffering
of
a
distancing
from
that
which
matters
most
of
us
can
be
excruciating
and
yet
even
these
sensations
are
a
part
of
the
rhythm
of
the
seasons
of
the
processes
each
of
us
undergoes
many
times
throughout
our
lives
[
Music
]
we
each
have
periods
of
flowering
of
new
leaves
and
possibilities
for
the
future
[
Music
]
we
have
the
strong
green
growth
of
summer
when
small
apples
begin
to
appear
between
our
bridges
and
our
lives
become
glossy
with
gentle
rains
there
is
the
abundance
of
fall
when
our
plans
and
dreams
become
fruitful
the
air
sweet
with
the
crispness
of
ripe
fruit
but
there
are
other
times
too
there
is
the
time
when
we
drop
our
leaves
letting
our
branches
become
bare
falling
into
restful
silent
dormancy
[
Music
]
there
are
the
times
when
the
orchard
keeper
comes
pointing
out
to
us
the
branches
that
have
been
withered
or
split
the
ones
that
no
longer
produce
leaves
or
fruit
there
is
the
pain
of
losing
these
branches
the
loss
of
something
that
was
once
creative
productive
beloved
but
no
matter
how
agonizing
this
is
there
is
always
that
time
when
new
shoots
appear
tiny
branches
that
stand
out
electric
green
with
life
against
our
silvery
gold
trunks
and
so
the
cycle
continues
from
flower
to
fruit
to
rest
and
back
again
and
through
it
all
we
are
rooted
solid
in
our
roots
and
our
place
in
the
orchard
anchored
against
the
coldest
snows
sharpest
rains
strongest
gales
[
Music
]
no
matter
what
happens
our
roots
hold
us
steady
and
our
fellow
trees
brave
the
elements
with
us
take
a
few
minutes
now
and
allow
your
body
and
mind
to
fully
drink
in
the
scene
around
you
the
beautiful
white
and
gold
expanse
of
the
orchard
you
have
been
planted
in
smell
the
air
be
all
the
Sunshine
's
warm
touch
let
the
sounds
of
birds
and
animals
guide
you
into
a
deeper
relaxation
the
combination
of
wind
and
soil
war
and
cold
motion
and
stillness
lull
you
into
a
total
and
complete
serenity
we
will
continue
on
together
in
a
few
minutes
you
this
this
right
here
in
this
very
moment
is
the
sensation
of
groundedness
with
each
exhale
you
feel
your
body
and
mind
relax
a
little
more
with
every
inhale
you
breathe
in
a
clarity
purpose
and
peace
you
are
rooted
and
stable
yet
free
able
to
reach
to
all
the
sky
and
sway
in
the
breeze
and
perhaps
most
importantly
you
are
surrounded
by
others
others
who
love
you
and
respect
you
and
wish
to
help
you
you
grow
together
each
unique
but
journeying
toward
the
same
balanced
peacefulness
strong
individually
as
a
whole
take
these
last
few
minutes
of
meditation
to
savor
it
[
Music
]
and
coming
back
now
to
the
room
we
began
this
meditation
becoming
aware
of
the
cells
in
this
room
presently
surrounding
you
beginning
to
wiggle
your
fingers
and
toes
awakening
your
body
returning
to
your
body
stretching
out
your
muscles
every
muscle
every
tender
and
when
you
were
ready

can
open
your
eyes
enjoy
your
day
or
evening
ahead

[

[

in

in
and
out
of
your

the
rolling
rhythms
of
sound

light
waves

breath
washes
over
you
and
relaxes
you
a
little
deeper
with
each
exhalation

in

guided
meditation

'll
open
your

attention
be
assured

for
the

of
this
guided
meditation
you
may
let
them
pass
these
thoughts
and
ideas
serve
as
your
reminder
that
you
are
a
vessel
you
are
receptive
to
the
needs
of
your
environment

the
needs
of
your

are
separate

[
Music

after
finding
a
comfortable
position
so
you
can
now
relax
the
entire
body
we
will
begin
by
shifting
the
use
of
your
senses
as
we
focus
or
softened
each
of
your
senses
you
can
allow
yourself
to
use
that
change
to
drift
toward
a
more
restful
and
fulfilling
sleep
for
calming
your
mind
and
your
body
in
this
guided
meditation
first
we
let
go
of
the
visual
use
of
your
eyes
our
eyes
are
often
overworked
and
overlooked
for
care
in
this
world
of
artificial
light
[
Music
]
they
are
forced
to
work
harder
when
they
had
tired
and
they
deserve
a
rejuvenating
rest
as
much
as
the
rest
of
your
body
Afiya
is
a
little
well-deserved
vacation
by
relaxing
them
and
their
focus
of
interpreting
the
visual
world
around
you
[
Music
]
if
you
have
n't
already
done
so
you
may
wish
to
close
them
entirely
or
simply
soften
your
gaze
so
that
your
surroundings
melt
into
the
background
of
your
consciousness
[
Music
]
disconnecting
from
our
visual
sense
brings
our
awareness
in
focusing
on
the
benefits
of
rest
for
the
mind
and
for
the
body
while
it
is
the
job
of
the
eyes
to
look
outward
in
the
guided
sleep
meditations
we
wish
to
see
and
reveal
what
is
within
[
Music
]
in
the
extremities
of
your
body
beginning
with
the
hands
and
the
feet
unwind
yourself
settle
your
hands
and
feet
and
softener
allow
each
hand
and
foot
to
hang
limp
from
your
wrists
and
ankles
in
a
fully
rested
and
unflexible
let
them
hold
no
weight
and
have
the
sensation
of
weightlessness
as
they
rest
at
the
end
of
your
limbs
next
bring
your
relaxing
awareness
to
the
muscles
of
your
arms
and
lower
legs
[
Music
]
slackening
your
calves
and
forearms
unwinding
at
the
wrists
and
ankles
feel
a
general
loosening
throughout
that
first
length
of
your
extremities
feeling
those
areas
become
more
and
more
relaxed
melting
away
like
butter
in
the
Sun
unhinging
softening
and
unwinding
as
you
move
through
your
body
the
thighs
in
your
legs
and
biceps
in
your
arms
also
begin
to
melt
from
contact
with
this
spreading
relaxation
a
calm
warmth
greets
your
skin
and
muscles
like
the
breaking
dawn
of
an
open
field
as
the
Sun
comes
overhead
the
warmth
spreads
crossing
from
your
limbs
into
the
torso
and
hips
the
muscles
of
your
shoulders
back
chest
and
waist
dissolve
any
thymus
and
release
any
tension
as
you
drift
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
relaxed
dreamlike
State
feel
your
body

Jason
Stephenson
and
in
this
meditation
my
aim
is
to
help

achieve
a
healthier
body
mind
and
spirit
by
you
using
the
power
of
a
focused
desire
and
a
deep
body
relaxation
during
this
meditation
I
'll
ask
you
to
focus
on
different
parts
of
the
body
and
doing
so
will
take
you
into
a
deeper
state
of
being
so
you
can
better
access
your
subconscious
mind
and
harness
its
infinite
potential
people
do
not
realize
their
own
power
fortunately
for
you
you
are
exactly
where
you
must
be

your
greatest
gifts
your
will
and
your
imagination
so
please
be
comfortable
lying
on
your

keep
your

straight

will
not
impede
your
breathing
take
a
few
deep
breaths
to
ground
and
center
yourself
you
just
for
the
moment
let
go
of
any
expectations
as
you
lie
there
simply
focus
on
being
as
relaxed
as
comfortable
as
you
possibly
can
if
at
any
point
you
fall
asleep
that
's
fine
your
subconscious
mind
will
still
be
able
to
receive
these
instructions
to
help
you
bring
about
a
healthier
body
mind
and
spirit
for
you
so
right
now
I
'd

your

vanish

fleshy
part
around

eye
sockets

back
of
your
head
let
go

may
have
over
them

and
now
back
to
the
center
of
your

and
shifting

an
exercise
called
yoga
nidra
the
midway
point
between
wakefulness
and
sleep
many
liken
it
to
floating

calm
peaceful
waters
and
here
you
are
safe
ear
all
tension
is
gone
allowing
your
body
to
naturally
begin
its
healing
process

is
as
calm
as
it
can
be
while
still
conscious
so
it
's
also
here
that
you
're
at
your
most
powerful
because
it
's
in
this
state
that
the
barriers
between
your
conscious
and
your
subconscious
mind
are
at
their
weakest
so
let
's
begin
with
you
now
that
's
not
the
you
that
is
lying
down
and
breathing
expanding
with
each
in-breath

contracting
with
each
out
breath

'm
talking
to
the

that
is
listening
to
these
words
using
this
bodies
is
to
pick
up
vibrations
and
translate
into
sound
I
am
talking
to
the
you
that
is
feeling
these
sensations
through
this
body
that
senses
matter
through
flesh
that
detects
light
through
eyes
I
'm
talking
to
you
that
is
independent
of
these
things
that
animates
these
things
that
affects
these
things
but
is
unscathed
by
any
of
them
into
the
you
that
remains
unchanged
through
all
of
the
seasons
of
your
life
and
that
remains
even
when
this
body
is
unconscious
you
the
real
you
you
are
the
powerful
being
that
has
chosen
to
live
in
this
body
for
the
time
being
the
ancient
one
who
has
lived
many
lives
through
countless
eons
since
time
began
you
are
the
deathless
one
who
creates
worlds
and
strides
the
universe
delighting
in
the
infinity
of
space
to
whom
matter
and
time
mean
nothing
one
who
animates
this
body
through
breath
and
with
the
same
energy
that
enlivens
the
cosmos
an
actor
who
enjoys
the
drama
you
have
written
and
the
character
you
have
chosen
to
act
it
out
with
the
one
who
sees
without
eyes
ears
without
ears
and
feels
without
flesh
you
the
true
you
not
the
pretend
you
lying
in
deep
rest
as
it
breathes
in
and
out
you
have
done
a
wonderful
job
this
life
you
have
created
the
scenarios
you
put
it
through
the
things
that
identifies
with
Jex
it
calls
its
own
and
the
co-actors
it
interacts
with
are
all
masterpieces
well
done
it
has
been
a
thrilling
roller
coaster
riot
of
ups
and
downs
and
highs
and
lows
just
like
breath
it
rises
and
falls
expands
and
contracts
but
can
it
be
even
better
yes
again
imagine
a
healthier
body
one
that's
robust
energetic
and
strong
one
that
's
more
flexible
rebounds
faster
and
even
more
full
of
life
feel
that
feel
how
wonderful
that
feels
how
magnificent
our
static
body
like
a
child
again
remember
childhood
supple
brimming
with
irrepressible
energy
always
up
to
incredible
challenges
what
exuberance
and
joy
each
day
is
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
this
young
body
exploding
with
happiness
at
every
opportunity
to
move
to
test
one
strength
to
prove
one
's
fitness
to
the
admiration
of
one
and
all
and
the
stamina
the
endless
stamina
that
allows
you
to
run
and
jump
free
of
aches
and
pains
save
for
those
that
come
with
the
joy
of
exertion
after
a
laughter
filled
race
with
friends
after
gleefully
rushing
up
that
grassy
hill
wet
with
Dew
from
the
morning
after
shrieking
with
joy
while
running
barefoot
through
those
fragrant
flowered
fields
beneath
the
Sun
the
mind
of
childhood
endless
questions
and
awestruck
wonder
at
the
creation
that
you
are
a
part
of
the
creation
that
you
played
a
vital
role
in
making
such
a
mind
forgets
nothing
but
everything
is
a
fantastic
enigma
there
is
nothing
old
and
tired
nothing
humdrum
and
boring
wandah
piled
upon
Wanda
and
the
mind
reeling
with
the
delicious
hunger
to
know
more
of
what
you
have
wrought
or
as
your
co-creator
Carl
Sagan
once
said
the
cosmos
is
within
us
we
are
made
of
star
stuff
we
're
a
wave
in
the
universe
to
know
itself
so
day
by
day
do
just
that
with
your
mind
you
explore
what
you
have
wrought
with
your
own
imagination
and
will
and
what
you
see
you
delight
in
for
it
is
all
your
creation
your
days
and
nights
are
filled
with
bliss
confident
in
your
own
power
to
shape
and
reshape
your
world
according
to
your
sense
of
what
is
fitting
for
you
this
knowledge
enlivened
jus
fills
every
atom
in
this
your
body
with
love
with
life
with
peace
and
with
joy
for
at
peace
knowing
that
every
bone
every
muscle
every
fiber
in
every
cell
of
this
your
body
had
their
own
wisdom
and
power
greater
than
any
doctors
book
of
knowledge
there
is
no
damage
that
can
not
handle
no
hurt
they
can
not
take
care
of
no
need
they
can
not
provide
for
because
they
are
completely
perfect
and
whole
and
nights
of
filled

hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
chakra
balancing
meditation
that
it
's
aim
is
to
help
to
bring
harmony
to
your
chakras
cleansing
your
aura
and
guiding
you
into
a
deep
restorative
sleep
before
we
begin
I'd
like
to
give
you
a
little
bit
of
a
background
on
the
nature
of
the
chakras
within
the
body
there
are
seven
main
chakras
that
line
the
spine
we
can
imagine
these
chakras
as
spinning
vortexes
of
energy
unseen
to
the
eye
they
underlie
whatever
our
current
experience
may
be
each
chakra
corresponds
to
specific
organs
feelings
and
behaviors
this
healing
meditation
will
bring
awareness
to
these
energy
centers
and
balance
them
allowing
energy
to
flow
freely
in
all
parts
of
our
body
we
'll
explore
these
in
more
detail
as
we
dive
into
our
meditation
but
for
now
rest
in
the
knowledge
that
regardless
of
how
you
come
into
this
meditation
you
will
soon
bring
harmony
to
each
one
of
these
spinning
centers
of
energy
to
each
level
of
yourself
as
the
chakras
begin
to
balance
your
overall
being
will
come
into
greater
harmony
and
transcendence
a
deep
and
healing
cleanse
of
your
overall
aura
will
take
place
and
soon
you
will
enter
into
a
deep
and
restful
sleep
so
to
begin
make
sure
that
you
are
comfortable
you
might
like
to
use
any
cushions
or
blankets
that
you
need

Jason

and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
that
will
help
you
to
find
peace
and
inner
tranquility
before
you
naturally
fall
into
a
deep
and
restorative
sleep
short
while
you
'll
be
guided
to
relax
the
body
and
ease
the
mind
before
being
led
through
a
visual
journey
into
a
mystical
cave
of
peace
it
's
your
time
to
allow
yourself
to
be
carried
away
gently
through
this
journey
knowing
that
you
are
entirely
supported
in
this
present
moment
so
take
a
moment
now
to
ensure
that
all
end
of
day
activities
have
been
wrapped
up
alarms
should
be
set
and
liens
drawn
I
invite
you
now
to
come
into
a
comfortable
lying
down
position
ensuring
that
your
body
is
resting
with
ease
wherever
you
are
you
might
want
to
use
blankets
or
cushions
to
support
you
as
you
find
comfort
in
the
physical
space
you
occupy
[
Music

take
a
few
releasing
breaths
here
allowing
a
deep
sigh
to
leave
your
body
on
your
next
outward
breath
[
Music
]
to
begin
our
journey
into
tranquility
take
a
moment
to
observe
the
stillness
of
your
physical
body
as
dei
transforms
into
night
and
the
Sun
fades
away
we
are
invited
to
enter
a
much
needed
period
of
rest
and
rejuvenation
as
we
sink
into
the
stillness
of
night
rest
assured
there
is
nothing
we
need
to
consciously
engage
in
or
take
care
of
we
can
trust
that
the
body
will
work
by
its
way
of
its
innate
wisdom
so
take
a
moment
now
to
quietly
observe
the
miracle
of
this
body

feel
into
its
heaviness
as
you
sink
further
into
the
surface
beneath
you
you
might
want
to
notice
now
where
there
might
still
be
movement
despite
the
sense
of
stillness
notice
where
breath
brings
subtle
movement
to
the
body
how
it
causes
the
chest
and
stomach
to
expand
on
each
inhalation
and
to
fall
away
on
each
exhalation
[
Music
]
observe
how
beautifully
this
gentle
movement
intertwines
with
a
deeper
sense
of
complete
stillness
as
you
take
a
few
deep
breaths
here
in
silence
[

lure
us
into

to
run
on
its
own
terms
as
we
begin
to
witness
our
mental
movements
from
a
higher
or

vantage
point
we
practice
our
power
of
discernment
easing
challenging
thoughts

emotions
as
we
experience
greater
clarity
and
a
sense

peace

you
journey
through
this
meditation

this

distance

for

pause
just
a

at

brief
moments
of
complete
stillness
within
each

the
mind
to
gently
subside
as
you
become
more
attuned
to
the
present
moment

to
worried

distracting
thoughts
can
be
released
as
you
practice

the
observer
of
whatever
is
moving
through

allow
yourself
to
sink
further
and
further
into

out

cave
sends
its
wisdom
in
the
form
of
whispers

inner
sensations

all
at

cave

that
some
answers
require
extra
time
to
be

my
name
is
jason
stevenson
and
during
this
evening
session
i
will
guide
you
to
mindfully
ease
both
mind
and
body
before
we
journey
deep
into
a
healing
salt
cave
there
is
nothing
you
need
to
know
for
this
practice
and
nothing
you
need
to
actively
achieve
simply
let
the
words
offered
here
guide
you
back
into
your
innate
sense
of
balance
wholeness
and
presence
to
begin
tonight
's
meditation
just
take
a
moment
to
ensure
that
you
are
as
comfortable
as
you
can
be
supported
by
any
cushions
or
pillows
that
you
have
available
whether
on
your
side
or
on
your
back
ensure
that
your
spine
is
long
and
your
neck
is
aligned
with
your
spine
you
may
close
your
eyes
now
if
you
have
n't
already
done
so
and
then
just
take
a
few
moments
to
let
your
mind
catch
up
to
the
present
moment
paying
attention
to
what
it
feels
like
to
be
right
here
right
now
you
might
notice
the
felt
sensation
of
the
mattress
beneath
you
or
the
blankets
that
cover
you
or
you
might
open
your
awareness
to
the
sounds
that
filter
through
your
ears
alternatively
you
might
arrive
mentally
in
this
present
moment
by
noticing
what
it
feels
like
to
breathe
observing
the
subtle
expansion
and
contraction
that
occurs
with
each
breath
whatever
sensations
help
you
to
arrive
in
the
present
moment
just
spend
a
few
moments
noticing
them
without
judgment
notice
if
the
mind
wants
to
label
your
experience
as
good
or
bad
right
or
wrong
and
then
simply
let
those
labels
go
as
you
breathe
out
coming
back
to
the
very
simple
practice
of
just
noticing
[
Music
]
and
now
take
a
moment
to
notice
your
physical
body
beginning
by
drawing
your
attention
to
the
top
of
your
head
from
here
gently
start
to
scan
your
body
downwards
noticing
if
there
are
any
areas
of
tension
that
you
might
be
able
to
soften
or
release
just
simply
let
any
physical
tension
start
to
dissolve
into
the
surface
beneath
you
as
if
it
were
melting
away
as
we
move
through
this
practice
you
will
likely
notice
that
from
time
to
time
negative
thoughts
worries
or
other
unhelpful
ideas
and
images
might
rise
to
your
awareness
these
fearful
or
negative
thought
patterns
are
the
very
things
that
stand
in
the
way
of
our
experiencing
deep
peace
positivity
and
relaxation
now
what
typically
happens
when
negative
or
worried
thoughts
arise
is
one
of
two
things
first
we
might
find
ourselves
becoming
completely
swept
up
by
these
mental
stories
when
we
are
not
mindful
of
these
thought
patterns
they
can
weigh
heavily
on
our
sense
of
well-being
and
then
a
second
type
of
relationship
we
might
have
with
these
thoughts
is
one
of
avoidance
and
suppression
avoidance
and
suppression
however
are
not
long-term
solutions
to
troublesome
or
racing
thoughts
if
what
we
are
after
is
deep
peace
positivity
and
contentment
we
must
first
cultivate
a
more
nourishing
balanced
relationship
with
our
thoughts
and
from
here
we
can
explore
the
possibility
of
welcoming
positive
energy
and
ideas
into
our
consciousness
so
as
thoughts
arise
during
this
meditation
i
invite
you
to
witness
these
occurrences
as
if
you
were
an
outside
observer
of
them
rather
than
being
caught
up
in
the
stream
itself
consider
that
you
are
standing
at
the
side
of
the
riverbank
watching
mental
objects
come
and
watching
them
go
practice
this
for
a
few
moments
on
your
own
now
before
we
move
deeper
into
our
salt
cave
visualization
to
cultivate
positive
energy
and
a
deep
sense
of
peace
simply
observe
any
thoughts
that
arise
with
care
and
maintaining
a
subtle
gap
between
them
and
yourself
if
certain
thoughts
seem
to
have
a
heavy
pull
you
might
alternatively
guide
these
thoughts
down
to
the
center
of
your
heart
to
be
released
focusing
your
attention
on
this
loving
center
in
your
chest
now
to
cleanse
yourself
more
completely
before
we
step
into
our
visualization
i
invite
you
to
take
three
long
deep
breaths
and
releasing
with
a
soft
sigh
through
the
mouth
on
each
exhalation
after
that
final
exhalation
let
your
breath
return
to
its
natural
rhythm
and
your
attention
to
turn
towards
the
creative
capacity
of
your
mind
[
Music
]
within
your
creative
mental
space
you
find
yourself
now
on
a
rural
road
both
sides
lined
with
summer
trees
in
full
blossom
aromas
of
jasmine
and
lavender
dance
through
the
air
filling
your
heart
and
mind
with
each
full
breath
the
dirt
road
you
are
on
heads
north
weaving
through
the
fertile
land
in
the
direction
of
a
sweet
sanctuary
a
salt
cave
spa
where
you
will
rest
deeply
for
the
night
to
come
all
you
carry
with
you
is
a
small
backpack
of
belongings
an
open
mind
and
a
vibrant
heart
slowly
and
gently
you
walk
down
the
country
road
in
the
direction
of
the
peaceful
retreat
absorbing
the
natural
landscape
that
holds
you
as
you
journey
you
admire
the
vibrancy
and
vitality
of
this
summer
season
you
note
the
pastel
purple
blossoms
in
the
trees
the
shimmering
meadows
and
the
rich
healthy
farmland
that
has
been
well
cared
for
butterflies
flitter
from
wildflower
to
wildflower
filling
the
open
air
with
beauty
and
wonder
far
into
the
distance
way
beyond
the
furthest
trees
the
sun
begins
its
descent
warm
orange
glow
is
cast
upon
the
land
as
the
earth
spins
away
from
the
sun
for
another
day
you
let
your
entire
body
be
bathed
in
its
warm
it
does
n't
take
long
before
the
spa
comes
into

the
salt
cave

is
housed
in
a
grand
stone
mansion
built
some
centuries
ago
it
is
covered
in
whispering
vines
and
rambling
roses
the
gardens
surrounding
it
are
wild
yet
still
well
tendered
the
place
is
soothing
inviting
a
wave
of
surrender
to
wash
through
your
body
and
mind
you
make
your
way
closer
to
the
entrance
soon
arriving
on
the
front
porch
before
entering
you
take
a
moment
to
say
good
night
to
the
setting
sun
you
revel
in
the
orange
pink
light
that
appears
above
the
tree
line
and
then
gently
you
make
your
way
inside
you
have
arrived
after
regular
check-in
hours
and
so
a
key
has
been
left
out
for
you
picking
it
up
you
notice
that
the
tag
reads
salt
sweet
three
and
then
you
follow
the
hallway
that
leads
to
your
room

dimly
lit

is
infused
with
the
sweet
smell
of
orange
oil

soft
candles
fastened
to
the
walls
add
an
air
of
elegance
while
guiding
you
toward

will
be
yours
for
the
coming
night
as
you
reach

let
yourself
in
with
the
key
unveiling
a
beautiful
softly
lit
bedroom
and
another
door
that
leads
down
to
your
very
own
salt
cave
[

upon
the

is
a
cotton
robe
dropping
your
backpack
and
taking
off
your
shoes
you
prepare
yourself
for
restorative
evening
ahead
and
change
into
the
cozy
robe
before
you
enter
the
door
to
the
salt
cave
you
notice
a
jug
of
lemon
water
has
been
placed
out
before
you
you
pour
yourself
a
small
glass
and
then
raise
it
to
your
lips
feeling
the
properties
of
both
water
and
lemon
cleansing
hydrating
and
alkalizing
your
body
as
you
sip
you
feel
yourself
coming
into
a
deeper
state
of
balance
both
mentally
and
physically
now
you
decide
to
head
into
the
salt
cave
and
as
you
open
the
door
to
enter
you
are
faced
with
a
set
of
stairs
lit
by
the
soft
glow
of
smoldering
candles
you
take
a
long
deep
breath
in
and
letting
it
go
with
the
sigh
and
then
you
begin
your
descent
step
by
step
[
Music
]
with
each
step
you
take
you
feel
your
mind
growing
more
relaxed
and
your
heart
growing
wider
your
body
softens
too
your
forehead
jaw
and
shoulders
all
melting
towards
the
wooden
stairs
beneath
your
feet
[
Music
]
a
warm
amber
glow
from
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
entrances
you
sending
a
rippling
wave
of
warmth
and
positivity
through
your
cells
and
as
you
reach
that
lower
level
your
jaw
drops
at
the
side
of
it
the
cave-like
room
covered
in
soft
pink
salt
the
walls
are
made
of
salt
as
is
the
floor
beneath
you
as
you
step
off
that
final
stair
it
feels
as
if
you
are
stepping
onto
a
beautiful
soothing
beach
all
around
you
small
candles
are
lit
radiating
an
orange
glow
through
salt
candle
holders
and
through
the
air
of
the
room
you
notice
that
sweet
smell
of
orange
oil
once
again
you
take
a
long
full
breath
in
slowly
letting
it
go
as
a
subtle
smile
stretches
across
your
face
in
the
center
of
the
room
a
cushion
and
blanket
rest
you
make
your
way
towards
them
and
then
rest
your
back
on
the
soothing
nourishing
salt
your
head
rests
on
the
pillow
and
you
lay
the
blanket
across
your
body
from
the
neck
down
arms
rest
by
your
sides
your
feet
fall
outwards
naturally
and
your
entire
body
surrenders
into
the
salt
crystals
beneath
you
[
Music
]
candlelight
flickers
against
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
cave
guiding
you
into
a
calm
and
tranquil
state
of
being
now
you
become
more
acutely
aware
of
the
music
that
flows
through
the
cave
sounds
that
work
on
an
energetic
level
to
cleanse
both
body
and
mind
and
to
uplift
and
nourish
your
vibration
as
the
sounds
permeate
your
cells
all
worries
all
fears
all
limiting
beliefs
begin
to
untangle
themselves
falling
away
from
your
body
and
into
the
salt
beneath
you
for
transformation
you
feel
the
warmth
of
the
coarse
salt
against
your
body
it
unwraps
you
holding
you
unconditionally
against
the
earth
the
air
you
breathe
is
enriched
with
salt
too
rejuvenating
your
entire
being
with
each
breath
you
soften
your
belly
and
relax
your
shoulders
even
further
allowing
each
breath
to
flow
as
deep
as
it
comfortably
reaches
[
Music
]
you
imagine
each
breath
extending
out
from
your
lungs
traveling
deep
into
any
parts
of
you
that
are
in
need
of
care
and
nourishment
focusing
in
on
any
particular
area
of
concern
whether
of
mind
or
body
you
direct
the
breath
to
that
part
of
you
letting
each
inhalation
bring
with
it
fresh
regenerative
positive
energy
and
each
exhalation
to
free
you
of
limiting
or
negative
thoughts
the
salt
cave
absorbs
everything
that
no
longer
serves
you
working
its
alchemical
magic
to
restore
any
heavy
energy
to
its
original
pure
state
continue
to
breathe
here
to
bathe
in
the
soothing
sounds
of
the
salt
cave
and
to
sink
into
the
crystals
beneath
you
the
candles
continue
to
burn
casting
that
soft
orange
light
across
the
cave
your
own
body
too
absorbs
the
healing
glow
as
the
candles
flicker
gently
they
bestow
upon
you
an
extra
wave
of
love
light
and
positivity
you
are
growing
tired
now
nearly
ready
to
surrender
to
the
night
completely
though
there
is
a
bed
upstairs
waiting
you
you
long
to
rest
where
you
are
to
sleep
amidst
the
salt
crystals
and
to
continue
absorbing
their
positive
soothing
energy
as
you
slumber
you
take
a
moment
now
to
make
any
final
adjustments
to
your
position
so
that
you
can
drift
away
effortlessly
and
then
you
close
your
eyes
to
the
salt
cave
slipping
into
the
empty
spaciousness
within
you
the
beautiful
music
continues
to
flow
through
your
ears
carrying
you
softly
into
sleep
you
drift
away
slowly
feeling
love
and
warmth
pervading
mind
body
and
spirit
you
know
there
is
nothing
left
for
you
to
do
but
to
let
go
to
sink
further
and
further
into
a
deep
night
of
peace
ease
and
tranquility
your
breath
and
the
sound
vibrations
carry
you
there
until
soon
you
find
that
you
have
arrived
in
the
world
of
sweet
and
restorative
dreams

hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stephenson
and
welcome
to
this
guided
before
sleep
meditation
prepare
to
be
taken
on
a
journey
of
pure
deep
relaxation
as
you
connect
with
your
senses
and
engage
with
your
inner
treasures
learning
from
your
past
present
and
future
moments
to
experience
all
the
benefits
of
this
guided
meditation
lie
down
and
get
comfortable
for
a
peaceful
night
of
sleep
make
sure
that
you
will
not
be
disturbed
as
you
settle
into
a
position
where
you
can
lie
comfortably
for
the
duration
of
this
recording
close
your
eyes
and
prepare
for
a
deep
sense
of
relaxation
sleep
and
well-being
[
Music
]
remember
that
this
is
your
time
a
chance
for
you
to
escape
from
the
problems
of
everyday
life
to
allow
the
tensions
of
the
day
to
dissipate
and
to
connect
with
your
inner
self
with
your
eyes
closed
breathe
deeply
and
slowly
through
your
nose
and
then
slowly
exhale
through
your
mouth
allowing
any
tension
within
you
to
disperse
as
the
breath
leaves
your
body
[
Music
]
now
inhale
again
breathing
in
slowly
through
your
nose
to
a
count
of
four
feel
the
air
entering
your
lungs
and
extend
your
diaphragm
as
you
do
so
enabling
the
air
to
reach
into
the
bottom
of
your
lungs
once
you
've
done
that
hold
the
breath
for
two
seconds
and
then
slowly
exhale
through
your
mouth
to
a
count
of
four
once
more
so
it
's
breathing
in
for
four
holding
for
two
counts
and
breathing
out
for
four
this
is
called
rhythmic
breathing
and
it
will
help
you
to
absorb
the
techniques
required
to
help
you
breathe
your
way
through
any
tensions
and
to
be
able
to
release
any
worries
anxieties
or
physical
tensions
each
time
on
the
out-breath
I
'll
give
you
a
few
moments
to
do
this
[
Music
]
now
breathe
normally
in
and
out
through
your
nose
feeling
the
tension
leaving
your
body
as
you
continue
to
do
so
your
arms
and
legs
will
start
to
feel
heavier
and
you
should
feel
the
back
of
the
chair
or
the
mattress
supporting
your
body
as
you
let
all
of
the
tension
go
if
you
still
feel
areas
of
tension
within
your
body
deliberately
tighten
up
those
areas
holding
the
muscle
tension
and
then
release
and
feel
the
difference
as
your
muscles
relaxed
feel
the
tension
leaving
your
body
as
it
does
so
so
tighten
and
release
relaxing
further
and
deeper
into
your
meditative
state
[
Music
]
you
[
Music
]
continue
the
cycle
of
breath
as
you
imagine
walking
on
a
beautiful
sandy
beach
the
sand
is
shimmering
under
the
gentle
but
warm
rays
of
an
early
Sun
there
is
a
subtle
breeze
that
's
teasing
your
hair
and
soft
against
your
skin
the
sky
is
a
beautiful
blue
cloudless
and
stretches
forever
sinking
only
onto
a
distant
horizon
where
the
sea
and
the
sky
unite
in
a
matching
Azur
color
you
feel
relaxed
free
and
look
around
you
take
in
the
most
beautiful
picture
postcard
scene
you
were
sitting
in
a
sheltered
Cove
with
glorious
cliffs
reaching
up
into
the
sky
providing
a
secure
backdrop
to
this
perfect
scene
the
rocky
cliffs
glimmer
gray
and
red
with
the
warming
intensity
of
the
Sun
and
you
catch
glimpses
of
white
feathers
as
seabird
soar
and
dive
circling
on
rising
thermals
distant
bird
songs
filter
through
the
air
and
the
piercing
cause
of
seagulls
swooping
high
and
low
over
the
gentle
waves
brings
back
childhood
memories
of
seaside
escapades
a
light
breeze
whips
across
the
sandy
cove
and
the
Sun
burns
even
brighter
in
the
sky
you
stand
up
and
walk
along
the
coastline
dealing
the
warm
sand
on
the
soles
of
your
feet
and
through
your
toes
frothy
waves
wash
up
onto
the
beach
and
in
the
distance
white
sailing
boats
drift
by
the
feeling
is
one
of
peace
as
you
walk
along
the
golden
sands
you
see
up
ahead
what
seems
like
a
gentle
homeless
man
with
a
small
dog
walking
on
the
edge
of
the
lapping
waters
he's
looking
up
to
the
sky
muttering
to
himself
and
calling
out
to
the
seagulls
clothed
in
tattered
pants
and
a
white
baggy
shirt
with
an
overgrown
beard
carrying
two
bags
of
what
looks
like
clothes
and
blankets
he
approaches
you
in
turns
and
speaks
directly
to
you
your
treasure
chest
is
near
in
a
deep
cavern
his
voice
trails
off
as
he
passes
you
however
a
breeze
picks
up
and
you
hear
his
final
words
riches
beyond
belief
you
turn
to
see
him
once
more
however
as
you
do
this
he
and
his
dog
are
nowhere
to
be
seen
you
sit
for
a
moment
on
the
sandy
beach
to
collect
your
thoughts
wondering
what
that
was
all
about
his
words
echo
inside
your
head
your
treasure
chest
is
near
riches
beyond
belief
getting
up
from
the
sand
you
are
drawn
to
a
cliff
face
opposite
the
beach
that
appears
to
have
a
cave
carved
within
it
out
of
curiosity
you
begin
to
move
towards
it
clambering
carefully
over
small
rocks
strewn
out
into
their
ever
reaching
tides
you
wander
through
small
rock
pools
feeling
the
coolness
of
the
water
on
your
feet
the
beach
cave
looks
welcoming
and
as
you
approach
the
rocks
have
been
smoothed
as
if
by
hand
and
you
reach
out
and
trail
your
fingers
against
the
entrance
to
the
cavern
walls
there
is
a
coolness
in
places
and
in
others
the
rocks
are
warm
to
the
touch
where
the
Sun
touches
them
as
you
take
in
the
scene
in
front
of
you
and
move
forward
you
see
dappling
light
around
the
walls
of
the
cave
mesmerizing
welcoming
and
intriguing
the
temperature
within
the
entrance
dips
immediately
but
it
is
n't
cold
it
feels
nice
to
be
out
of
the
sunlight
for
a
while
marvel
at
the
contours
of
the
beach
cave
in
front
of
you
pockets
of
stone
walkways
smooth
walls
with
a
contrast
of
light
and
dark
as
small
gaps
in
the
rock
face
allow
the
Sun
to
penetrate
the
darkened
depths
the
beach
cave
has
a
strange
almost
spiritual
feel
to
it
peaceful
and
tranquil
and
yet
it
feels
as
if
it
has
had
a
purpose
not
simply
carved
by
the
elements
but
by
loving
hands
smoothing
the
stone
into
submission
the
sound
of
water
can
be
heard
echoing
from
deeper
into
the
cave
although
the
tide
is
gently
lapping
along
the
rocks
leading
to
the
cave
entrance
inside
the
low
rocks
are
dry
so
no
danger
from
an
encroaching
tide
the
temperature
changes
as
you
move
deeper
into
the
labyrinth
of
cavernous
rooms
a
carved
archway
lies
ahead
of
you
and
the
cave
room
within
flickers
and
sparkles
with
flecks
of
green
as
you
move
into
the
deeper
part
of
the
cavern
you
hear
the
words
once
more
vibrating
throughout
the
cave
your
treasure
is
near
in
a
cavern
riches
beyond
belief
you
're
drawn
to
move
forward
and
enter
a
space
so
soothing
and
peaceful
that
you
feel
any
remaining
tension
dissipate
to
your
right
deeper
within
the
cave
you
see
what
looks
to
be
a
dusty
old
ornate
chest
moving
to
this
large
old
crate
curious
to
see
what
this
is
you
blow
the
dust
and
sand
away
it
reveals
to
you
what
looks
to
be
an
ancient
old
treasure
chest
could
this
be
the
treasure
chest
the
homeless
man
on
the
beach
was
referring
to
treasure
nearby
you
sit
in
front
of
it
get
comfortable
and
loosen
the
already
unlocked
latches
the
chest
opens
it
glistens
with
gold
you
see
that
is
divided
into
three
sections
they're
marked
past
present
and
future
and
in
each
section
a
small
tin
boxes

you
glanced
into
the
section
of
the
chest
marked
past
and
see
a
little
green
emerald
encrusted
tin
taking
this
out
easing
the
lid
off
slowly
you
see
two
folded
pieces
of
paper
you
unfold
the
first
piece
gently
and
it
has
printed
in
beautiful
handwritten
calligraphy
the
words
let
go
take
a
moment
to
meditate
on
this
what
is
this
telling
you
is
this
something
from
the
past
that
you
need
to
release
and
let
go
of
perhaps
an
old
relationship
a
habit
that
no
longer
serves
you
for
you
or
your
highest
good
just
take
these
next
few
moments
to
let
go
and
find
peace
in
the
release
of
old
and
worn-out
patterns

to
read
the
next
piece

up

both
of

back
into
the

you
found
it
as
you
do
this
you
feel
a
cool
breeze
blow
gently
throughout
the
cavern
as
if
clearing
away
any
final
thoughts
on
letting
go
and
forgiveness
you
reach
back
into
the
chest
and
take
out
a
ruby
encrusted

has
been
marked
with
the
word
present

peel
back

wander
during

soon
gain
control
over
your
mind

gently
and
firmly

to
race

back
again
to
your
breathing
it
's
all
a
part
of
the
learning
process
and
you
will
still
gain
all
the
benefits
of
this
meditation
session
so
if
you
're
ready
let
's
begin
visualize
yourself
now
transported
to
the
steps
leading
up
to
an
old
bridge
made
from
stone
weathered
from
time
and
from
an
assault
by
the
elements
there
are
steps
curving
upwards
with
cast
iron
railings
swirling
alongside
affording
magnificent
views
across
the
deep
tranquil
waters
surrounded
by
a
mass
of
greenery
the
breeze
is
soft
against
your
skin
warm
but
soothing
visualize
yourself
moving
up
the
steps
each
step
is
worn
and
uneven
but
they
are
shallow
you
find
them
easy
to
climb
trail
your
fingers
across
the
top
of
the
railings
and
feel
the
iron
warm
beneath
your
fingertips
at
the
final
step
turn
and
look
across
the
expanse
of
water
it
is
afternoon
and
the
Sun
has
started
its
gradual
descent
across
the
sky
and
as
the
light
changes
the
trees
surrounding
the
water
glow
and
the
colors
change
for
perhaps
the
first
time
you
become
in
tune
with
nature
you
become
aware
of
the
depth
of
color
that
exists
as
clouds
scurry
across
the
blue
expanse
of
sky
notice
how
the
light
shifts
and
the
sun
's
rays
muted
send
rays
of
gold
across
the
tranquil
waters
flecks
of
light
dance
on
the
tips
of
slow-moving
water
cresting
in
places
this
place
exudes
serenity
you
feel
calm
you
feel
relaxed
you
feel
peaceful
inhale
deeply
drawing
fresh
pure
oxygen
deeply
into
your
lungs
exhale
fully
feeling
your
lungs
deflate
as
you
do
so
and
repeat
this
intake
of
breath
feeling
air
inflating
your
lungs
once
more
and
as
you
breathe
out
let
go
of
any
negative
feelings
or
tension
that
you
may
be
harboring
in
your
body
just
let
it
all
go
turn
your
attention
back
to
the
scene
in
front
of
you
and
notice
the
power
of
blue
sky
as
if
dabbed
on
creatively
and
mixed
with
cotton
wool
white
to
form
the
clouds
a
screen
of
green
adorns
the
edges
of
blue
the
breeze
sends
leaves
whirling
up
into
the
air
along
with
the
blossom
you
watch
it
as
it
cascades
even
higher
at
the
mercy
of
the
air
current
and
gradually
released
dropping
towards
the
surface
of
the
water
where
once
lazy
fish
rise
to
the
surface
to
investigate
as
you
stand
here
and
observe
you
realize
that
you
are
an
integral
part
of
this
scene
there
is
a
sense
of
oneness
yet
you
have
not
been
here
before
it
is
as
if
something
has
been
missing
in
life
previously
and
now
there
is
a
sense
of
wonder
as
to
what
is
to
come
ask
yourself
who
are
you
deep
within
what
do
you
need
what
are
you
searching
for
just
allow
these
questions
to
resonate
within
you
you
feel
a
deeply
wonderful
connection
with
nature
more
than
you
have
thought
was
possible
you
feel
mesmerised
by
the
sun
's
rays
as
they
penetrate
the
foliage
casting
an
almost
autumn
glow
as
clouds
scurry
past
the
Sun
the
light
changes
again
and
this
time
the
leaves
are
shimmering
gold
and
yellow
these
trees
are
different
they
Bend
and
sway
teased
by
the
breeze
it
is
as
if
you
are
standing
on
the
threshold
of
two
worlds
it
is
as
if
you
're
looking
back
over
the
past
and
all
that
could
have
been
when
you
turn
and
look
in
the
other
direction
your
perspective
shifts
and
you
are
filled
with
positive
energy
life
is
fleeting
every
second
merges
with
the
next
and
clock
hands
continue
to
move
never
pausing
each
passing
moment
striding
fords
to
greet
the
next
and
such
is
life
with
each
season
that
blends
effortlessly
the
world
continues
to
turn
this
place
feels
almost
spiritual
and
it
feels
as
if

through
to

where
you
sense
the
warm
beckoning
presence
of
a
familiar
place
ascend
the
stairs
feeling
yourself
grow
more
and
more
relaxed
as
you
reach
the
top
you
are
in
a
library
a
place
you
may
have
been
before
ahead
of
you
Liars
a
comfortable
looking
chair
with
a
small
sandy
colored
book
lying
on
the
cushion
let
yourself
sink
into
the
chair
and
pick
up
the
book
as
you
open
the
cover
and
begin
to
read
you
notice
the
type
growing
larger
filling
your
vision
completely
almost
as
soon
as
it
begins
it
dissolves
away
leaving
you
in
a
totally
new
and
different
place
you
are
sitting
on
a
warm
stone
wall
above
you
is
the
electric-blue
of
a
summer
sky
and
surrounding
you
are
wildflowers
growing
out
of
the
sandy
soil
breathe
in
the
scent
of
these
blooms
and
listen
to
the
gentle
rustle
of
their
leaves
in
the
slightest
of
breezes
this
place
is
safe
and
comforting
a
stone
wall
you
are
seated
on
radiates
the
sun
's
warmth
filling
your
body
with
a
heady
sense
of
power
feel
the
way
the
heat
from
the
rock
and
the
sky
above
you
touches
your
skin
warming
you
to
the
core
you
realize
that
just
as
the
rock
holds
the
sun
's
rays
you
hold
and
radiate
your
own
incredible
power
even
on
cloudy
days
the
Sun
is
still
there
and
even
when
you
feel
weak
or
powerless
your
strength
and
unbreakable
will
are
there
as
well
next
to
you
on
the
wall
is
a
simply
made
pottery
jug
and
a
glass
bottle
with
a
cork
the
bottle
is
empty
but
the
jug
is
full
of
an
inky
black
liquid
at
the
very
core
of
your
being
you
realize
that
this
black
substance
represents
your
fears
and
anxieties
stored
deep
inside
your
subconscious
mind
it
is
normal
to
carry
fear
with
you
sometimes
however
our
busy
lives
do
not
leave
us
time
to
address
these
anxieties
and
they
can
fill
up
this
jug
inside
your
mind
when
you
feel
anxious
it
is
simply
your
mind
asking
you
to
spend
a
moment
or
two
relaxing
and
tending
to
this
need
this
is
what
this
time
is
for
as
we
move
through
this
meditation
you
will
have
the
opportunity
to
cleanse
yourself
of
all
anxiousness
and
stress
that
you
carry
with
you
right
now
pick
up
the
jug
feeling
the
underlying
complexity
of
its
earthenware
construction
to
not
be
afraid
of
this
vessel
nothing
it
contains
is
harmful
you
are
entirely
safe
as
you
peer
over
the
lip
of
this
jug
and
look
into
your
reflection
in
the
black
liquid
as
you
hold
the
jug
you
feel
the
warmth
from
your
hands
and
the
Sun
warming
it
and
you
realize
that
you
are
about
to
recognize
the
sources
of
your
fears
at
a
deep
level
of
understanding
and
forgiveness
so
take
a
moment
to
watch
your
reflection
begin
to
shift
forming
itself
into
whatever
picture
you
need
to
see
to
understand
your
anxiety
perhaps
more
than
one
scene
will
appear
either
way
smile
gently
and
say
thank
you
to
each
picture
you
encounter
expressing
gratitude
for
its
work
and
message
in
your
life

as
the
scenes
in
the
jug
dissolve
back
into
the
liquid
allow
yourself
to
pick
up
the
glass
bottle
next
to
you
remove
the
cork
and
pour
the
contents
of
the
jug
into
it
knowing
that
you
can
not
spill
the
black
liquid
now
that
you
have
communicated
with
it
once
every
last
drop
of
the
liquid
has
left
the
jug
carefully
replace
the
bottle
stopper
and
stand
up
you
take
a
few
steps
forward
and
see
that
you
have
been
sitting
on
the
rock
wall
overlooking
a
very
deep
valley
in
your
heart
you
know
that
no
one
has
ever
seen
this
valley
except
for
you
and
that
it
is
a
perfect
reflection
of
your
own
innate
power
take
a
moment
to
reflect
on
what
you
see
below
and
understand
that
it
is
a
geological
expression
of
you
and
your
unbreakable
will
you
need
not
be
afraid
anymore

with
this
euphoric
realization
feel
the
weight
of
the
glass
bottle
in
your
hand
raise
your
arm
over
your
head
and
giving
one
last
thank
you
to
the
liquid
inside
the
glass
throw
it
as
hard
as
you
can
into
the
valley
below
you
see
the
glass
bottle
shatter
far
below
you
the
inky
black
liquid
spilling
out
across
the
ground
yet
before
your
eyes
it
begins
to
evaporate
turning
into
a
silver
shimmery
mist
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
you
hear
faint
strains
of
song
out
of
the
Mist
emerge
thousands
of
birds
their
feathers
all
the
cars
of
the
rainbow
they
fly
up
and
into
the
sky
above
you
swirling
and
dipping
in
an
aerial
dance
of
pure
delight
watch
their
patterns
as
they
move
across
the
sky
and
allow
yourself
to
realize
that
you
yourself
have
transformed
your
fear
and
anxiety
into
this
beautiful
spectacle
before
your
eyes
listen
to

way
they

flutter
across
the

blue
sky

the
birds
make
a
huge
lap
through
the
valley
a
farewell
signal
to
you
and
dispersed
far
into
the
distance
you
smile
wishing
them
the
best
of
luck
in
everything
they
do
as
you
do
this
you
sense
something
behind
you
and
when
you
turn
around
you
realize
it
is
the
book
from
the
library
before
your
eyes
it
opens
and
the
familiar
sight
of
printed
letters
floods
your
vision
lifting
you
from
the
warmth
of
the
stone
cliff
the
letters
rush
faster
and
faster
then
dissolve
leaving
you
sitting
back
in
the

the
book
resting
on
your

allow
yourself
to
rise
and
return

passing

after

of

books
approach
the

begin
your

approach
the
door
below
you
you
feel
the
same
sense
of
power
you
felt
by
the
stone
war
rushed
through
your
veins
you
've
contained
the
strength
of
character
to
change
anything
you
encounter
allow
yourself
to
hold
this
sense
of
confidence
and
purpose
with
you
as
you
approach
the
place
you
began
this
meditation
you
have
returned
from
this
meditation
a
changed
person
and
so
begin
to
wiggle
your
fingers
and
toes
gently
wake
up
the
parts
of
you
that
have
rested
why
you
are
on
your
journey
when
you
are
ready
let
your
eyes
open
and
smile
at
the
world
around
you
you
are
powerful
enough
to
transform
fear
into
beauty
now
allow
this
ever-present
strength
to
guide
you
through
the
rest
of
your
day
or
evening

hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
calm
down
for
sleep
guided
meditation
journey
possibly
you
've
come
here
because
your
mind
is
overworked
you
're
feeling
stressed
whatever
the
case
you
've
arrived
at
the
right
place
and
this
meditation
is
for
you
so
without
further
ado
let
's
relax
the
mind
and
firstly
I
want
to
drop
the
word
and
I
want
you
to
drop
the
word
meditation
there
is
so
much
associated
with
meditation
what
it
is
meant
to
do
and
what
we
must
achieve
from
meditation
so
let
's
drop
everything
associated
with
achieving
anything
and
let
's
just
simply
call
this
a
before
sleep
journey
so
right
now
we
want
to
let
go
of
all
expectations
and
set
out
to
achieve
nothing
just
to
simply
be
if
we
can
just
be
we
are
on
the
path
to
peace
of
mind
accepting
all
that
is
in
this
given
moment
so
getting
comfortable
now
wriggling
around
if
necessary
arms
by
your
side
feet
relaxed
and
just
let
your
feet
part
naturally
as
they
choose
to
begin
by
closing
your
eyes
and
gently
taking
three
deep
breaths
in
through
your
nose
and
out
through
your
mouth
and
on
the
breath
in
sending
that
breath
all
the
way
down
to
your
lower
belly
area
and
feeling
this
area
expand
and
as
you
breathe
out
feeling
it
deflate
like
a
balloon
that
's
releasing
air
[
Music
]
and
once
you
've
done
this
returning
your
breath
to
a
natural
and
comfortable
rhythm
breathing
in
and
out
through
your
nose
[
Music
]
now
during
this
journey
we
're
about
to
embark
on
together
thoughts
are
going
to
come
and
go
in
fact
you
're
going
to
go
off
on
tangents
into
your
own
world
and
at
times
not
even
realizing
that
you
've
drifted
off
and
away
from
this
sleep
journey
this
is
perfectly
okay
so
when
you
become
aware
of
this
just
welcome
your
awareness
back
saying
to
yourself
ah
Here
I
am
again
back
on
my
journey
so
no
matter
how
many
times
you
have
to
do
this
it
's
perfectly
okay
and
normal
to
have
thoughts
coming
and
going
so
right
now
just
become
aware
of
your
body
the
weight
of
it
the
feeling
of
your
head
on
the
pillow
or
the
mattress
and
feel
yourself
as
you
begin
to
get
heavier
as
though
you
are
sinking
through
the
mattress
with
each
breath
feel
this
heaviness
sweep
across
your
body
from
your
core
Center
out
to
the
extremes
of
your
body
your
toes
your
fingers
the
top
of
your
head
feel
this
getting
heavier
and
heavier
[
Music

if
you
sense
any
worries
or
concerns
at
this
moment
you
can
let
them
go
now
you
are
safe
in
this
moment
right
where
you
belong
in
perfect
timing
[
Music
]
as
you
feel
yourself
sinking
I
would
like
you
to
visualize
that
you
are
sinking
through
to
a
soft
Bank
of
white
fluffy
clouds
now
you
may
see
these
white
clouds
you
may
feel
them
or
just
simply
sense
that
they
are
there
surrounding
you
comforting
you
[
Music
]
you
may
have
had
a
busy
day
today
with
a
hectic
schedule
but
right
now
give
yourself
permission
to
let
this
go
even
if
only
for
the
next
few
minutes
allow
any
stress
and
tension
in
your
body
to
melt
away
to
dissolve
and
the
clouds
are
here
to
help
you
as
they
wrap
you
within
their
softness
protecting
you
nurturing
you
[

[

within
this
time
and
space
you
have
the
opportunity
to
let
go
of
your
worries
and
fears
and
take
some
time
to
simply
be
[
Music
]
so
embrace
this
chance
to
be
without
thinking
and
instead
focus
your
mind
on
the
warmth
and
drowsiness
it
's
filling
your
limbs
allow
yourself
to
move
softly
and
intuitively
through
this
journey
allowing
the
physical
sensations
around
you
to
be
your
focus
instead
of
thoughts
or
worries
if
you
find
thoughts
surface
blow
them
out
on
your
next
breath
let
them
go
[

breathing
deeply
[

you
are
continuing
to
drift
downwards
sinking
through
the
clouds
softly
safely
moving
closer
and
closer
to
a
glowing
white
light
shining
brightly
comforting
you
as
you
get
closer
to
it
you
feel
your
shoulders
effortlessly
release
the
stress
they
bear
you
notice
the
way
your
cheeks
smooth
out
any
frown
lines
vanishing
as
you
move
nearer
to
this
light
your
tongue
falls
away
from
the
roof
of
your
mouth
the
backs
of
your
knees
dissolve
into
relaxation
as
the
muscles
in
your
body
finally
let
go
of
tension

've
carried
with
you
today
every
bit
of
tension
with

allow
yourself
to
sink

become
so

deal
your
body
become
heavier
and
heavier
as
your
mind
softens
and
your
breathing
slows
down
finally
reaching
a
deep
and
restful
place
[
Music

as
you
were
drawn
close
to
the
glowing
white
light
you
allow
yourself
to
be
absorbed
into
the
gentle
warmth
that
emits
when
the
warmth
enters
your
body
flowing
through
your
veins
and
even
easing
any
aches
and
pains
you
may
be
experiencing
you
drift
deeper
into
this
velvety
bed
of
fluffy
white
clouds
feel
the
softness
of
the
clouds
around
you
the
clouds
are
warm
and
comforting
delicately
reaching
out
to
embrace
you
your
head
drifts
into
the
airy
whiteness
surrounding
you
closely
followed
by
your
torso
and
your
outstretched
arms
and
legs
your
whole
body
is
supported
by
the
ethereal
yet
unquestionable
sturdy
fibers
of
a
thousand
clouds

delicate
cool
tendrils
brush
against
your
skin
as
they
wipe
away
wrinkles
on
your
forehead
these
wisps
are
so
soft
and
tense
muscles
and
leave
you
feeling
rested
and
drowsy
allow
yourself
to
continue
to
sink
deep
into
the
clouds
and
accompanying
relaxation
drift
on
this
gentle
plateau
of
clouds
for
a
moment
savoring
the
absence
of
thoughts
around
you

the
sensations
that
come
with
it
be
all
the
soft
heat
of
the
Sun
on
your
face
now
and
your
eyelids
as
they
drift
shut

to
breathe
deeply
inhaling
the
gentle
sunlight
and
exhaling
any

focusing
on
your
breath
brings
you
to
an
even
deeper
sense
of
calm
and
relaxation
in
fact
as
you
breathe
deeper
and
deeper
closer
to
the
bottom
of
your
lungs
you
begin
to
notice
any
lingering
thoughts
and
worries
as
brightly
colored
balloons
surrounding
your
pillowy
resting
place
these
concerns
take
shape
as
you
watch
them
moving
through
the
same
sky
as
you
the
thoughts
above
you
drift
back
and
forth
attached
to
you
with
thin
almost
invisible
strings
although
these
thought
balloons
are
fascinating
to
watch
move
across
the
sky
above
you
they
hold
you
aloft
when
all
you
want
to
do
is
to
continue
to
sink
further
into
the
welcoming
bed
of
clouds
around
you
so
take
a
moment
to
look
at
these
thoughts
above
you
enjoying
their
colors
say
thank
you
for
their
presence
with
you
today
as

examine
and
thank
your
thoughts
imagine
now
cutting
all
the
thin
threads
binding
them
to
you
[

watch
these
thought
balloons
drift
upwards
their
strings
dancing
as
they
rise
into
the
air
above
you
watch
them
until
the
small
colourful
shapes
disappear
from
view
[

these
buoyant
thoughts
are
gone

youhello
there
my
name
is
jason
stevenson
and
welcome
to
tonight
's
guided
meditation
to
help
calm
the
mind
and
release
anxious
thoughts
in
tonight
's
meditation
i
'll
provide
you
with
guidance
to
witness
anxious
thought
streams
to
surrender
to
them
and
to
return
to
your
inner
peace
whoever
you
are
no
matter
what
you
are
experiencing
you
are
welcome
here
we
will
move
through
this
process
slowly
and
gently
and
you
'll
be
given
plenty
of
time
to
shift
and
soften
any
anxiety
that
is
present
for
you
during
this
practice
you
are
encouraged
to
drift
off
to
sleep
whenever
slumber
comes
naturally
for
you
so
we
will
begin
by
taking
a
few
moments
to
settle
in
through
breath
and
body
awareness
and
then
i
will
guide
you
to
a
comfortable
place
in
the
middle
of
a
tranquil
forest
an
environment
that
will
further
help
you
to
let
go
and
so
before
we
begin
take
a
moment
to
find
a
comfortable
laying
down
position
that
will
be
supportive
of
deep
sleep
when
the
time
comes
just
allow
your
spine
to
lengthen
and
your
limbs
to
soften
as
you
feel
into
how
gravity
is
holding
you
here
right
now
closing
your
eyes
whenever
you
feel
ready
and
take
a
moment
to
check
in
with
your
physical
body
just
inquire
with
your
body
about
whether
you
might
need
anything
else
in
this
moment
perhaps
a
pillow
a
blanket
a
pair
of
socks
or
any
other
adjustment
and
when
you
're
ready
find
a
comfortable
position
of
relative
stillness
you
do
n't
need
to
aim
for
complete
stillness
as
your
body
is
always
in
subtle
motion
anyways
but
see
if
you
can
surrender
as
much
as
you
can
into
non-doing
knowing
that
you
are
always
free
to
make
adjustments
as
you
need
to
throughout
the
practice
and
turn
your
attention
towards
the
breath
for
a
few
moments
now
just
minding
its
natural
rhythm
as
it
moves
through
your
body
and
for
the
next
few
breath
cycles
refrain
from
changing
the
breath
in
any
way
simply
allow
it
to
flow
naturally
while
also
considering
the
fact
that
each
full
breath
cleanses
and
nourishes
and
supports
you
each
breath
in
restores
your
blood
of
the
oxygen
it
requires
and
each
breath
out
emits
what
no
longer
serve
you
and
now
i
invite
you
to
take
three
deep
breaths
at
your
own
pace
beginning
whenever
you
are
ready
and
inhaling
to
the
furthest
depth
that
is
still
comfortable
for
you
and
then
exhale
maybe
releasing
a
soft
sigh
or
anything
else
that
yearns
to
be
let
go
of
inhale
completely
and
exhale
what
you
no
longer
need
after
your
third
deep
breath
just
continue
to
breathe
naturally
and
then
take
a
moment
to
re-ground
into
the
surface
supporting
you
and
just
take
note
of
each
part
of
your
body
that
is
in
contact
with
your
bed
and
noting
the
sensation
of
fabric
against
your
skin
and
before
we
move
into
the
forest
inside
your
mind
just
take
a
moment
to
offer
a
word
of
gratitude
for
the
place
that
holds
you
right
now
make
a
note
of
any
aspects
of
your
environment
that
you
can
be
thankful
for
in
this
very
moment
and
when
you
're
finished
turn
towards
the
creative
center
within
your
own
mind
and
through
your
mind
i
invite
you
to
travel
consciously
now
finding
yourself
in
a
brilliant
forest
held
beneath
the
warm
late
summer
sun
you
were
standing
on
a
narrow
footpath
of
aromatic
amber
soil
and
on
either
side
of
you
majestic
trees
stretch
up
towards
the
beaming
cosmos
the
wind
is
warm
as
it
brushes
just
gently
against
your
cheeks
standing
here
in
the
wilderness
of
these
woods
your
shoulders
begin
to
soften
and
drop
this
forest
sanctuary
comes
to
you
as
a
refuge
away
from
the
weight
of
the
world
from
all
that
you
felt
you
needed
to
carry
in
the
days
up
until
now
for
these
precious
moments
i
invite
you
to
grant
yourself
permission
to
let
go
to
simply
tune
into
what
is
right
here
and
to
open
up
to
the
possibility
of
deep
release
and
inner
peace
as
you
grant
yourself
this
permission
you
know
that
you
do
n't
need
to
force
yourself
to
feel
any
different
than
you
do
right
now
and
furthermore
know
that
opening
up
to
inner
peace
does
not
mean
that
all
of
your
outer
world
challenges
will
disappear
however
consider
that
there
is
a
chance
of
finding
respite
beneath
the
waves
of
the
worried
mind

only
that
this
peace
and
tranquility
is
possible
opening
your
heart
to
the
journey
that
guide
you
there
now
take
a
moment
to
feel
into
your
body
here
in
the
forest
as
you
witness
yourself
acclimatizing
to
your
new
environment
perhaps
you
might
see
yourself
stretch
your
arms
up
towards
the
sky
or
reaching
down
to
the
earth
in
reverence
witness
yourself
moving
in
any
way
that
helps
to
free
up
and
release
stagnant
or
anxious
energy
within
your
body
eventually
you
returned
to
standing
gazing
down
the
trail
stretched
out
before
you
the
path
ahead
is
whimsical
weaving
in
and
out
of
the
old
growth
forest
you
take
a
long
deep
breath
inhaling
the
forest
air
and
as
you
exhale
you
begin
on
your
way
taking
the
trail
mindful
step
by
step
as
you
go
you
absorb
the
beauty
of
the
forest
around
you
hummingbirds
flitter
through
the
air
and
squirrels
and
chipmunks
jump
from
treetop
to
treetop
ancient
ferns
rise
up
from
the
earth
in
their
cosmic
patterns
and
countless
other
species
of
plants
and
animals
make
themselves
known
to
you
in
fact
the
diversity
is
beyond
anything
you
've
ever
seen

a
moment
to
explore
the
environment
for
yourself
as
you
walk
through
it
allow
it
to
come
to
life
with
any
plants
animals
or
even
insects
that
bring
you
a
sense
of
peace
and
well-being
consider
the
fact
that
your
inner
forest
is
completely
unique
to
your
own
mind
and
imagination

it
to
life
in
any
way
that
soothes
you

other
words

your
inner
refuge
as
you

witness
the
peace
that
lives
in
this
forest

how
a
sense
of
ease
grows
inside
of
you
notice
your
belly
softening
your
limbs
relaxing
and
your
worried
or
controlling
mind
letting
go
even
further
breath
by
breath
by
breath
simply
just
being
in
this
forest
provides
you
with
something
you
it
helps
you
to
naturally
and
effortlessly
begin
the
process
of
letting
go
now
soften
your
gaze
on
the
plants
and
animals
of
this
forest
as
you
focus
once
again
on
the
trail
ahead
of
you
as
you
do
you
notice
that
this
pathway
ends
just
a
few
meters
up
ahead
and
where
it
does
there
is
a
small
clearing
in
the
woods
you
make
your
way
towards
the
clearing
which
enchants
your
heart
and
mind
completely
it
's
surrounded
by
tall
ancient
trees
with
wild
flowers
lining
the
perimeter
teal
violet
and
fuchsia
petals
are
in
full
bloom
the
soil
in
the
clearing
is
bare
but
it
's
still
rich
and
full
of
invisible
energy
and
in
the
center
of
it
a
tiny
nest
of
sorts
has
been
laid
out
for
you
a
persian
rug
is
spread
across
the
solid
earth
and
on
top
of
it
plush
cushions
and
blankets
are
scattered
this
human-like
nest
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
has
your
name
on
it
and
so
you
make
yourself
cozy
within
it
as
you
come
to
rest
your
back
on
the
soft
rug
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
wriggling
your
body
to
get
comfortable
you
take
a
few
deep
breaths
to
settle
in
and
softening
your
belly
as
you
breathe
with
each
breath
in
you
embrace
the
vitality
of
the
forest
around
you
and
with
each
outward
breath
you
feel
yourself
melting
a
little
bit
further
into
the
earth
each
breath
brings
you
back
to
what
is
right
here
back
to
the
peace
that
is
possible
when
you
connect
with
what
is
present
you
continue
to
breathe
naturally
as
you
gaze
out
at
the
world
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
those
majestic
trees
stand
even
taller
with
canopies
that
dance
through
the
glistening
sun
the
trees
are
alive
you
can
feel
their
energy
and
you
embrace
their
shelter
their
stability
and
their
protection
now
gazing
up
at
the
canopy
you
see
that
there
is
enough
open
space
for
the
sunlight
to
pour
through
as
it
does
it
blesses
your
entire
body
not
only
does
it
offer
you
its
warmth
it
offers
ease
and
release
as
well
to
further
soothe
the
mind
you
tune
in
more
closely
to
the
physical
body
as
it
rests
beneath
this
glorious
sun
you
begin
by
drawing
your
attention
towards
your
crown
feeling
the
golden
light
of
this
radiant
star
penetrating
opening
and
softening
the
uppermost
part
of
you
this
light
begins
to
seep
downwards
relaxing
all
the
muscles
around
your
eyes
it
disarms
the
flow
of
any
repetitive
and
unhelpful
thought
patterns
you
exhale
to
release
surrendering
your
mind
to
the
cleansing
power
of
this
light
and
then
you
feel
the
sun
's
rays
inch
further
down
filling
and
relaxing
your
jaw
your
tongue
and
your
throat
you
take
a
long
deep
breath
into
this
golden
light
feeling
it
ease
any
tension
you
've
been
carrying
in
and
around
this
part
of
you
still
resting
on
the
forest
floor
you
feel
into
the
sun
's
light
as
it
enters
your
shoulders
and
then
as
it
slowly
seeps
into
your
upper
arms
your
elbows
and
lower
arms
and
into
your
hands
as
this
metallic
yellow
light
fills
you
from
shoulders
to
fingertips
you
feel
your
arms
let
go
you
feel
them
surrender
you
know
that
there
is
nothing
you
need
to
latch
onto
nothing
you
need
to
fix
to
grasp
or
to
sort
out
you
just
grant
your
arms
permission
to
surrender
the
light
from
your
shoulders
now
enters
into
your
upper
torso
your
lower
back
melts
it
surrenders
and
your
heart
space
opens
up
to
the
universal
light
that
touches
it
as
you
breathe
life
force
moves
into
and
out
of
your
heart
with
complete
ease
and
then
the
golden
light
seeps
even
further
downwards
tracing
the
length
of
your
spine
until
it
lands
in
the
center
of
your
belly
as
you
breathe
here
feel
your
belly
filling
with
radiant
sunlight
it
dissolves
all
tension
all
contraction
and
all
worry
helping
you
to
breathe
a
little
deeper
at
the
same
time
your
lower
back
begins
to
soften
as
well
coming
into
deeper
and
deeper
peace
here
in
the
forest
where
you
rest
you
witness
as
the
sun
's
glow
enters
your
pelvic
region
now
and
as
it
does
your
hips
begin
to
unknot
tension
begins
to
melt
seeping
into
the
earth
beneath
you
for
renewal
and
finally
the
golden
light
of
the
sun
begins
to
inch
its
way
down
your
legs
first
it
fills
your
upper
legs
relaxing
all
of
these
muscles
completely
then
it
flows
down
to
your
knees
into
your
calves
and
shins
and
eventually
into
your
feet
into
each
and
every
toe
feel
both
of
your
legs
surrendering
with
the
support
of
the
light
shining
down
from
above
you
waves
of
calm
pulse
through
your
entire
body
follow
them
for
a
moment
now
witnessing
them
as
currents
of
golden
light
ebbing
and
flowing
from
the
top
of
your
head
to
your
toes
and
then
from
your
toes
to
the
top
of
your
head
and
back
again
as
this
golden
wave
of
calm
rises
up
to
your
crown
it
eases
your
mind
and
connects
you
to
everything
around
you
and
as
it
ebbs
back
towards
your
feet
it
grounds
you
deep
into
the
earth
providing
you
with
a
sense
of
strength
and
resilience
the
sun
's
rays
continue
to
hold
you
as
you
tune
into
other
elements
of
the
forest
now
first
you
notice
the
sweet
aroma
that
fills
your
nostrils
as
you
breathe
you
absorb
the
aliveness
of
the
forest
with
each
full
breath
then
your
eyes
trace
the
lengths
of
those
remarkable
trees
which
are
firmly
rooted
calm
and
stable
you
admire
the
base
of
the
trees
and
the
intricate
pattern
of
their
bark
and
then
your
gaze
rises
up
them
noticing
the
complexity
of
branches
that
extend
out
from
the
solid
stable
core
the
leaves
on
those
upper
branches
are
diverse
and
varied
even
from
down
below
you
can
see
that
some
are
round
some
are
triangular
and
some
are
irregular
like
the
leaves
of
the
chestnut
trees
and
the
maples
just
together
they
dance
seamlessly
in
the
soft
breeze
occasionally
you
witness
a
leaf
splitting
from
its
branch
and
dancing
down
towards
the
earth
you
admire
how
effortlessly
it
lets
go
how
naturally
it
surrenders
as
you
gaze
up
at
the
leaves
you
realize
how
transient
they
are
seasons
come
and
seasons
go
and
throughout
the
seasons
the
trees
shed
their
leaves
in
order
to
be
renewed
and
so
you
liken
the
leaves
above
you
to
the
thoughts
that
come
and
go
for
seasons
in
your
mind
anxious
or
worried
thoughts
are
just
as
transient
as
those
delicate
leaves
that
shimmer
in
the
wind
and
so
as
you
rest
here
beneath
the
canopy
pair
each
falling
leaf
with
an
anxious
ruminating
or
worried
thought
that
you
would
like
to
release
or
soften
as
one
of
these
thoughts
come
to
mind
see
it
falling
towards
the
rich
and
fertile
earth
as
a
delicate
leaf
does
at
the
end
of
its
season
as
each
leaf
of
anxiety
or
worry
falls
towards
the
earth
something
remarkable
happens
time
appears
to
speed
up
in
your
mind's
eye
as
you
watch
each
fallen
leaf
transmute
from
vibrant
green
to
deep
red
to
dark
rust
and
quickly
as
if
you
were
watching
time-lapsed
film
you
observe
each
leaf
decay
becoming
one
with
the
bed
of
soil
it
rests
on
continue
to
watch
this
miraculous
process
of
transformation
on
your
own
link
each
anxious
thought
with
a
falling
leaf
and
as
it
arrives
on
the
earth
watch
as
alchemy
takes
over
what
begins
as
a
worried
delicate
leaf
fluttering
in
the
wind
of
life
is
capable
of
transforming
of
becoming
rich
dense
soil
through
the
ever-present
possibility
of
transformation
remember
that
your
body
is
a
tool
to
facilitate
release
with
each
thought
that
surrenders
to
the
earth
allow
the
body
to
surrender
as
well
by
relaxing
your
body
you
encourage
the
mind
to
do
the
same
any
and
all
sorts
of
anxious
thoughts
can
be
processed
in
this
way
so
long
as
the
cause
of
your
concern
does
not
require
urgent
action
in
this
moment
it
's
possible
to
tap
into
a
sense
of
surrender
and
to
let
go
of
anxious
thoughts
does
not
mean
we
do
n't
care
about
certain
outcomes
or
that
we
are
in
denial
of
how
we
feel
rather
it
's
a
simple
recognition
that
the
past
can
not
be
returned
to
that
the
future
is
undetermined
and
that
all
we
have
is
the
present
moment
and
in
this
present
moment
we
can
choose
to
open
ourselves
up
to
deeper
peace
you
continue
to
rest
on
the
forest
floor
bundled
up
as
the
sun
moves
behind
the
canopy
now
the
air
is
still
warm
and
so
you
are
completely
comfortable
take
a
few
more
moments
of
silence
to
watch
leaves
of
anxious
thoughts
fall
towards
the
earth
watch
them
quickly
and
effortlessly
turn
into
dried
leaves
and
then
into
soil
itself
your
eyes
are
growing
tired
but
you
continue
to
absorb
the
tranquility
of
the
world
around
you
here
amongst
the
plants
insects
and
trees
you
realize
that
anxiety
is
not
a
concern
the
various
beings
that
call
this
forest
home
simply
go
about
their
lives
they
know
what
needs
to
be
done
and
they
do
it
and
the
rest
they
leave
an
awareness
grows
within
you
that
nature
does
n't
need
to
worry
yes
there
are
times
when
it
must
leap
into
action
to
protect
itself
but
it
does
n't
over
ruminate
it
doesn't
overthink
this
recognition
alone
helps
you
to
breathe
deeper
helps
you
to
further
surrender
you
come
back
to
your
breathing
feeling
the
natural
rhythm
of
this
cycle
moving
through
you
just
like
the
seasons
the
breath
comes
and
it
goes
it
comes
and
it
goes
you
feel
yourself
surrendering
deeper
to
this
universal
wisdom
of
the
breath
you
realize
that
there
is
indeed
an
innate
universal
force
that
is
holding
you
and
supporting
you
you
realize
now
that
you
do
not
need
to
do
nor
do
you
accomplish
everything
on
your
own
and
so
if
you
'd
like
to
i
invite
you
now
to
ask
the
universal
energy
all
around
you
for
any
support
that
you
need
for
a
final
release
in
other
words
is
there
something
that
you
are
still
struggling
to
let
go
of
something
that
you
need
support
with
and
if
so
turn
towards
the
sky
that
seeps
through
the
canopy
overhead
and
ask
for
its
wisdom
for
its
support
if
you
hear
a
wise
voice
offer
its
support
to
you
know
that
not
only
does
it
come
from
the
universe
around
you
it
comes
simultaneously
from
inside
your
very
own
being
you
are
the
holder
of
the
wisdom
that
you
seek
for
a
few
more
silent
moments
come
back
to
the
falling
leaves
let
any
thoughts
that
do
not
serve
you
be
surrendered
now
allow
the
universe
and
your
inherent
wisdom
to
support
you
with
this
if
it
feels
natural
for
you
you
might
even
tap
into
a
sense
of
joy
as
you
observe
the
falling
leaves
letting
go
does
n't
always
have
to
be
difficult
often
there
is
joy
in
release
now
you
can
tell
by
the
movement
of
shadows
that
the
sun
is
beginning
its
final
departure
the
forest
appears
to
be
preparing
for
a
good
night
's
rest
animals
have
slowed
their
stirring
butterflies
have
retreated
for
the
night
and
all
that
remains
in
their
place
is
near
stillness
as
the
earth
slows
down
so
do
you
the
mind
which
had
already
experienced
a
sense
of
quiet
tranquility
slows
even
further
you
are
beginning
to
pass
into
the
state
between
wakefulness
and
sleep
but
before
you
drift
off
completely
you
continue
to
take
in
the
radiance
of
the
world
around
you
namely
the
colors
in
this
evening
sky
first
the
sky
illuminates
with
a
soft
clementine
orange
glow
it
does
n't
quite
reach
the
uppermost
cosmos
but
the
horizon
casts
its
light
through
the
surrounding
trees
this
radiant
orange
light
floats
across
your
body
granting
you
warmth
and
balance
and
vitality
from
head
to
toe
you
open
yourself
up
to
it
completely
soon
the
orange
light
in
the
sky
begins
to
transmute
electric
magenta
begins
to
shine
through
in
its
place
as
it
covers
your
body
it
grants
you
a
sense
of
childlike
wonder
magic
and
trust
open
your
heart
to
this
enchanting
pink
glow
the
light
in
the
sky
continues
to
shift
soon
the
once
pink
glow
becomes
a
deep
mesmerizing
violet
a
color
associated
with
wisdom
spiritual
connection
and
the
soothing
of
emotions
you
feel
yourself
coming
into
complete
alignment
as
this
violet
light
passes
over
you
all
of
your
cells
all
of
your
muscles
your
nerve
endings
and
all
of
your
organs
are
touched
by
this
cleansing
radiant
light
it
fills
your
entire
body
from
the
tips
of
your
toes
to
the
crown
of
your
head
and
as
it
fills
your
mind
space
it
dispels
any
last
ruminating
thought
patterns
that
may
have
been
stubbornly
holding
on
you
do
n't
need
to
bring
them
with
you
into
the
slumber
ahead
the
dark
violet
color
grows
deeper
soon
becoming
a
midnight
blue
you
can
still
make
out
the
night
sky
against
the
black
silhouette
of
trees
overhead
and
through
that
empty
space
that
exposes
you
to
the
cosmos
the
milky
way
begins
to
appear
the
thick
blanket
of
stars
is
mesmerizing
you
feel
completely
safe
and
supported
here
in
the
forest
somehow
as
the
day
has
departed
and
the
midnight
hour
creeps
closer
you
have
gained
an
embodied
sense
of
belonging
you
feel
a
part
of
this
forest
a
part
of
this
entire
earth
and
universe
in
fact
and
it
is
this
deep
sense
of
belonging
that
awakens
your
inner
peace
worried
thoughts
may
still
rise
from
time
to
time
but
you
've
gained
a
new
perspective
of
them
ear
gazing
out
at
the
milky
way
you
realize
that
in
fact
you
are
not
looking
out
at
the
stars
you
are
a
part
of
them
and
being
a
part
of
the
universe
like
this
you
are
unconditionally
supported
through
everything
you
are
unconditionally
loved
sink
into
this
deeper
understanding
of
your
belonging
for
a
few
long
deep
breaths
if
you
'd
like
to
you
might
want
to
release
a
soft
sigh
with
each
exhalation
if
any
worries
or
anxious
thoughts
creep
back
know
that
you
hold
the
power
to
release
and
to
soften
them
just
refrain
from
judging
these
thoughts
or
pushing
them
away
simply
acknowledge
them
as
a
part
of
yourself
that
simply
needs
your
love
and
compassion
grant
them
your
love
let
them
know
how
strong
you
are
and
then
allow
these
unhelpful
thoughts
just
to
fade
away
through
the
canopy
above
you
catch
side
of
the
moon
making
itself
known
to
the
dark
sky
tonight
it
is
a
waning
crescent
moon
fading
into
darkness
day
by
day
by
day
this
waning
moon
offers
a
final
reminder
to
surrender
it
invites
you
to
make
space
by
cleansing
the
old
so
that
you
may
set
new
intentions
and
new
belief
systems
to
empower
you
in
the
days
to
come
so
as
you
gaze
up
at
the
radiant
silver
of
the
moon
take
a
moment
to
consider
what
intention
you
'd
like
to
set
for
the
day
that
awaits
you
what
qualities
or
ways
of
being
would
you
like
to
harness
while
you
sleep
and
carry
into
tomorrow
once
you
have
your
intention
silently
repeat
it
to
the
moon
three
times
release
your
words
of
intention
when
you
've
finished
your
third
repetition
and
sinking
back
into
the
silent
stillness
of
the
evening
forest
feel
back
into
your
breath
observing
once
again
it
's
continual
coming
and
going
and
as
you
breathe
listen
closely
see
if
you
can
hear
the
sound
that
it
makes
if
you
can
hear
it
liken
this
sound
to
the
soft
flow
of
wind
through
a
tranquil
forest
canopy
like
the
one
overhead
of
you
now
you
close
your
eyes
and
once
again
you
can
feel
your
body
being
penetrated
with
soothing
light
energy
this
time
it
's
not
the
sun
it
is
the
subtlety
of
the
moon
and
so
eyes
closed
to
the
forest
around
you
you
feel
into
the
silver
light
of
this
moon
first
it
weaves
its
way
into
the
crown
and
headspace
reminding
you
to
let
go
again
and
again
and
again
as
many
times
as
is
needed
it
then
ebbs
its
way
into
your
cheeks
your
mouth
and
your
throat
helping
to
release
your
jaw
and
anything
you
've
been
clenching
onto
there
you
then
feel
the
moon
's
glow
moving
into
your
shoulders
and
as
it
does
you
release
your
shoulders
into
the
earth
words
of
the
indian
scholar
and
environmental
activist
vandana
shiva
come
to
mind
you
hear
her
whisper
you
are
not
atlas
carrying
the
world
on
your
shoulders
it
is
good
to
remember
that
the
planet
is
carrying
you
now
the
silver
light
seeps
into
the
full
lengths
of
your
arms
just
as
the
sun
did
all
those
moments
ago
the
silver
light
brings
deep
release
to
each
of
your
muscles
from
those
in
your
shoulders
all
the
way
down
to
your
fingers
let
them
go
let
each
of
those
muscles
surrender
for
the
night
you
trace
the
silver
light
back
up
and
into
your
chest
now
where
it
creates
a
sense
of
spaciousness
your
heart
area
illuminates
with
bright
silver
light
and
it
grows
with
each
inhalation
if
any
thoughts
arise
from
now
on
you
can
guide
them
into
this
luminescent
heart
for
transformation
now
the
silver
thread
of
light
weaves
its
way
along
your
spine
each
vertebrae
that
it
passes
surrenders
to
the
evening
and
eventually
your
stomach
fills
with
this
subtle
silver
glow
and
feel
your
breath
as
it
moves
into
this
space
the
silver
glow
expanding
in
your
belly
with
each
full
breath
and
it
softens
all
areas
around
your
core
front
and
back
side
to
side
this
calming
silver
energy
enters
into
your
hips
and
pelvis
bringing
softness
to
this
part
of
you
one
last
time
before
sleep
and
then
it
weaves
its
way
through
your
upper
legs
past
your
knees
into
your
lower
legs
ending
its
journey
at
the
tips
of
your
toes
just
allow
both
legs
to
relax
in
their
entirety
take
a
few
full
breaths
as
you
bathe
in
this
silver
light
of
the
moon
and
if
you
find
that
there
's
any
specific
part
of
you
that
longs
for
a
little
more
silver
light
energy
draw
your
attention
there
let
it
fill
to
the
brim
with
the
light
of
the
moon
and
when
you
are
ready
let
the
imagery
of
this
silver
light
soften
now
the
moon
is
still
there
high
up
in
the
night
sky
but
you
can
shift
your
attention
to
any
other
anchor
that
feels
soothing
for
you
perhaps
you
focus
on
the
breath
inhaling
and
exhaling
the
fresh
nourishing
air
perhaps
you
focus
on
what
it
feels
like
to
be
held
against
the
earth
by
gravity
what
it
feels
like
for
each
part
of
your
body
to
fully
surrender
each
muscle
to
fully
relax
into
the
surface
beneath
you
perhaps
you
gaze
up
at
the
milky
way
at
the
tops
of
the
trees
or
at
some
other
point
in
nature
that
soothes
and
settles
you
just
whatever
brings
you
a
sense
of
peace
presence
and
well-being
let
that
be
your
anchor
for
a
short
while
longer
and
slowly
now
i
invite
you
to
release
the
imagery
of
the
forest
from
your
mind
as
you
gently
shift
your
awareness
back
to
this
physical
reality
keep
your
mind
soft
you
've
not
physically
gone
anywhere
and
so
you
do
n't
need
to
return
you
've
always
been
here
you
've
always
been
held
by
this
space
the
entire
time
if
you
are
still
with
me
i
trust
that
sleep
will
be
coming
soon
for
you
between
now
and
then
use
whatever
anchor
you
please
to
keep
your
attention
focused
and
your
mind
calm
the
peace
and
tranquility
you
experienced
here
tonight
was
not
a
product
of
anything
outside
of
yourself
it
came
from
within
remember
this
deeper
truth
anytime
the
mind
seems
to
wander
off
on
its
own
remember
that
you
hold
the
power
in
all
moments
in
all
breaths
to
bring
yourself
back
to
peace

meditation
that
will
help
you
to
fall
asleep
quickly
and
effortlessly
after
a
brief
journey
through
the
body
we
will
take
a
trip
into
the
cosmos
during
which
you
will
fall
asleep
swiftly
held
beneath
the
soft
glow
of
the
moon
and
the
stars
allow
the
words
of
this
meditation
to
flow
effortlessly
through
you
there
is
nothing
you
need
to
hold
on
to
allow
yourself
to
surrender
into
slumber
at
any
point
during
this
practice
[
Music

now
to
begin
ensure
that
all
end-of-day
activities
are
taken
care
of
your
blind
should
be
drawn
any
required
alarms
should
be
set
and
all
lights
turned
off
or
shut
out
so
that
your
body
knows
it
's
time
to
rest
deeply
eyes
closed
take
a
moment
to
land
in
the
space
that
holds
you
making
any
necessary
adjustments
to
your
posture
for
extra
comfort
let
your
neck
form
one
straight
line
with
your
spine
as
all
muscles
soften
into
the
bed
or
other
surface
beneath
you
[
Music

turn
your
attention
towards
the
breath
as
you
spend
a
few
moments
grounding
through
this
force
of
life
that
gently
ebbs
and
flows
through
your
body
as
you
watch
your
breath
know
that
there
is
nothing
it
needs
to
do
in
no
particular
way
it
needs
to
flow
our
breath
contains
a
wisdom
that
knows
just
how
to
support
and
nourish
us
all
that
is
required
is
that
we
slowly
step
out
of
its
way
by
easing
the
mind
and
relaxing
the
body
as
we
move
through
this
practice
know
that
you
can
come
back
to
the
breath
any
time
you
need
to
anchor
yourself
back
into
the
present
moment
the
breath
your
physical
body
and
these
words
all
serve
that
purpose
each
invite
you
to
come
back
down
into
the
sweet
simplicity
of
this
night
now
let
's
take
a
moment
to
travel
through
the
body
softening
each
part
that
our
awareness
moves
through
begin
now
by
drawing
your
attention
to
the
crown
of
your
head
holding
your
awareness
there
for
a
few
moments
[
Music
]
imagine
this
uppermost
part
of
your
body
softening
and
a
process
that
trickles
down
slowly
to
ease
your
forehead
your
eyebrows
and
your
temples
let
your
entire
top
half
of
your
head
relax
releasing
all
physical
and
mental
tension
it
might
be
holding
and
then
slowly
let
this
softening
seep
into
your
cheekbones
and
your
jaw
your
mouth
and
your
tongue
as
your
awareness
gently
descends
further
it
brings
softness
to
your
neck
and
your
shoulders
helping
them
to
release
any
weight
they
may
have
carried
throughout
the
day
and
then
envision
that
softening
trickling
down
your
arms
relaxing
each
and
every
cell
all
the
way
to
your
fingertips
returning
your
attention
to
your
heart
space
now
allow
your
chest
to
relax
and
your
upper
back
as
well
and
then
slowly
scan
the
length
of
your
spine
downwards
inviting
all
tissues
and
muscles
that
surround
it
to
surrender
deeper
into
this
night
[
Music
]
your
attention
centers
itself
in
the
belly
now
and
let
all
muscles
around
your
core
relax
as
the
belly
rises
and
falls
with
each
breath
and
then
allow
your
awareness
to
soften
the
hips
the
pelvis
and
the
buttocks
before
gently
trickling
down
the
legs
softening
each
muscle
completely
until
arriving
at
the
tips
of
your
toes
[
Music
]
hold
your
entire
body
in
your
awareness
letting
it
surrender
completely
into
the
surface
beneath
you
you
might
notice
a
heaviness
within
your
body
as
well
as
a
lightness
the
sense
that
your
body
has
given
up
completely
to
the
weight
of
gravity
while
at
the
same
time
feeling
entirely
free
and
weightless
let
yourself
revel
in
that
sensation
for
a
few
breaths
now
the
feeling
of
being
held
by
gravity
while
also
freely
floating
within
the
airy
cosmic
universe
[
Music

[
Music

in
just
a
moment
we
will
begin
a
journey
into
the
stars
floating
gracefully
away
from
the
earth
yet
before
we
do
so
let
's
take
a
moment
to
realize
where
we
are
truly
headed
and
that
is
into
a
deep
and
restorative
slumber
so
before
we
begin
our
ascension
into
the
cosmos
take
a
moment
to
silently
repeat
i
let
go
let
go
i
let
go
surrendering
completely
to
the
weightlessness
of
[
Music

sleep
in
your
mind
's
eye
as
your
body
and
mind
become
lighter
i
invite
you
to
envision
that
you
are
resting
in
an
open
meadow
beneath
the
starry
sky
a
soft
blanket
of
grass
rests
beneath
you
your
body
is
kept
warm
amidst
the
summer
air
the
breeze
whistles
in
the
leaves
of
nearby
trees
rustling
through
tall
grasses
as
well
the
night
sky
is
onyx
black
reflecting
darkness
into
your
eyes
but
for
the
dazzling
stars
and
crescent
moon
above
you
[
Music
]
the
world
is
quiet
around
and
within
you
you
inhale
the
evening
air
filling
yourself
up
with
the
airy
cosmos
you
are
a
part
of
each
breath
in
brings
a
lightness
to
your
body
[
Music
]
and
each
breath
out
helps
you
to
let
go
to
surrender
to
the
sky
above
and
around
you
as
your
body
gets
lighter
you
notice
the
earth
beneath
you
drifting
away
suddenly
you
are
light
enough
to
be
untouched
by
the
weight
of
gravity
your
body
rising
above
the
ground
and
into
the
night
sky
you
are
not
afraid
you
know
you
are
protected
here
so
surrender
to
the
process
you
are
in
allowing
yourself
to
be
carried
away
from
the
earth
and
into
the
stars
[
Music
]
your
body
floats
higher
and
higher
passing
through
thin
veils
of
cloud
that
grace
the
atmosphere
the
air
around
you
is
quiet
as
is
your
mind
space
up
here
amidst
the
clouds
and
beneath
the
light
of
the
moon
nothing
of
your
life
on
earth
seems
to
matter
all
that
matters
is
this
miraculous
open
space
you
drift
through
drifting
further
away
from
the
earth
you
take
a
moment
to
look
down
upon
it
the
entire
globe
is
in
full
view
the
atmosphere
around
it
dark
and
peaceful
and
twinkling
lights
shine
back
at
you
as
if
mimicking
the
stars
no
sounds
of
the
earth
can
be
heard
from
where
you
are
no
traffic
no
wind
no
moving
water
you
are
miles
away
now
[
Music
]
your
entire
body
floats
higher
still
and
as
it
does
the
stars
become
larger
and
brighter
[
Music
]
your
eyes
land
on
one
star
in
particular
and
everything
else
seems
to
melt
away
you
spend
some
time
with
this
star
whispering
your
intentions
for
the
coming
day
and
inviting
it
to
support
you
in
surrendering
to
the
night
your
breath
is
still
soft
nourishing
you
as
you
float
high
above
the
earth
you
take
one
last
moment
to
commune
with
your
favorite
star
before
letting
your
attention
widen
to
all
the
other
celestial
bodies
that
find
their
home
within
the
sky
planets
comets
and
shooting
stars
all
come
into
view
as
you
gaze
into
the
abyss
of
the
cosmos
still
you
know
you
are
held
safe
by
the
universe
here
you
are
calm
peaceful
and
entirely
at
ease
[
Music

you
consider
all
the
constellations
that
are
spread
out
before
you
indeed
they
look
different
from
this
higher
vantage
point
their
patterns
not
so
easily
observed
this
close
up
and
yet
you
reflect
upon
some
of
your
favorites
orion
libra
capricorn
and
aquarius
now
that
you
are
here
in
the
realm
of
all
the
constellations
[
Music

you
understand
why
ancient
traditions
and
cultures
have
long
held
up
these
celestial
formations
the
closer
you
get
to
them
the
more
remarkable
they
come
the
more
they
enchant
your
mind
heart
and
soul
come
back
to
your
breath
with
full
awareness
now
inhaling
and
exhaling
deeply
your
body
remains
light
and
free
as
you
drift
through
the
cosmos
reveling
at
the
stars
now
like
a
feather
gliding
through
the
air
slowly
and
steadily
you
feel
your
body
slowly
coming
back
down
some
magic
mysterious
force
holds
you
supporting
you
as
you
move
gracefully
away
from
the
realm
of
planets
stars
and
the
moon
you
do
not
return
to
the
earth
just
yet
though
with
grace
you
land
gently
upon
a
plush
supportive
cloud
you
release
a
deep
sigh
as
you
sink
into
this
cosmic
cushion
letting
it
support
you
from
head
to
toe
as
you
rest
here
you
find
stillness
[
Music

you
gaze
up
at
the
mystery
of
the
atmosphere
above
you
eyes
landing
on
the
silver
of
the
moon
that
is
transitioning
through
its
waning
face
in
a
few
nights
from
now
it
will
become
a
dark
and
dazzling
new
moon
and
yet
for
now
it
is
waning
slowly
growing
smaller
at
a
rate
too
slow
for
the
human
eye
to
catch
in
a
single
moment
you
consider
the
energy
of
the
waning
moon
remembering
that
this
particular
lunar
transition
is
a
time
for
releasing
slowing
down
surrendering
and
restoring
now
is
the
time
to
sink
into
non-doing
to
let
yourself
be
exactly
as
you
are
perched
on
a
cloud
you
take
three
full
breaths
each
inhale
lasting
to
a
count
of
four
and
each
exhale
being
a
little
bit
longer
lasting
to
a
count
of
six
inhaling
for
four
and
exhaling
for
six

you
finish
one
more
breath
this
way
allowing
your
exhale
to
cleanse
you
of
any
residual
tension

weight
you
may
be
unconsciously
holding

to
return
to
its
natural
rhythm

up
at
the
night
sky
from
this
height
you
thank
it
for
all
that
it
has
illuminated
within
you
and
then
slowly
you
drift
like
a
feather
once
again
inching
your
way
closer
towards
the
solid
earth
as
you
make
your
final
approach

and

hello
and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
this
is
the
positive
miracles
guided
sleep
meditation
I
'm
Jason
Stephenson
we
're
often
told
about
the
importance
and
power
of
being
positive
but
knowing
that
we
should
be
positive
is
one
thing
but
actually
being
positive
is
another
and
when
the
day's
stresses
pile
up
and
things
do
n't
work
our
way
it
's
too
easy
to
give
in
to
our
emotions
and
feel
anything
but
positive
and
it
makes
it
harder
for
us
to
go
to
sleep
when
this
continues
we
sometimes
give
in
to
feelings
of
inadequacy
believing
that
we
're
not
good
enough
or
worthy
enough
and
never
will
be
at
the
very
worst
we
may
begin
to
suspect
that
there
's
a
vast
conspiracy
determined
to
foil
us
at
every
turn
and
thus
cynics
are
born
these
perpetuate
a
terrible
cycle
they
believe
they
're
not
good
enough
or
that
things
will
never
work
their
way
they
therefore
become
blind
to
wonderful
opportunities
awaiting
them
at
every
corner
thus
reinforcing
their
own
beliefs
and
this
is
the
prison
of
negative
thinking
now
this
meditation
is
the
antidote
to
such
a
prison
the
aim
of
this
meditation
is
to
get
you
to
sleep
with
miracles
of
positive
and
kind
intentions
so
let
's
begin
now
for
this
one
you
can
prepare
as
you
would
go
into
sleep
lying
down
on
your
back
or
you
can
sit
upright
with
your
spine
straight
and
this
allows
you
to
maintain
an
upright
but
comfortable
position
without
strain
to
help
you
breathe
more
easily
and
maintain
a
good
balance
let
your
shoulders
relax
and
rest
your
hands
palms
up
on
your
lap
or
by
your
side
if
you
are
lying
down
this
stabilizes
you
rolls
your
shoulders
back
and
opens
up
your
rib
cage
now
facing
straight
ahead
and
pretend
that
you
're
the
CEO
of
a
major
company
or
the
ruler
of
a
powerful
country
in
your
hands
lies
the
fate
of
millions
you
are
a
very
important
person
so
project
your
power
through
your
upright
and
confident
but
relaxed
posture
and
because
of
who
and
what
you
are
you
have
earned
the
right
to
just
be
for
now
all
appointments
meetings
schedules
and
deadlines
they
can
all
wait
but
now
they
must
take
a
back
seat
to
what
you
are
about
to
do
so
keeping
your
lips
closed
relax
your
jaw
so
that
there
's
a
gap
between
your
teeth
and
rest
the
tip
of
your
tongue
against
the
back
of
your
upper
teeth
gently
close
your
eyes
so
your
work
can
begin
now
please
pay
attention
to
your
breathing
and
notice
how
it
moves
in
and
out
of
your
body
and
how
your
body
responds
to
it
and
that
's
breathing
now
in
and
out
through
your
nose
notice
how
your
body
feels
a
sense
of
expansion
as
you
breathe
in
and
how
your
body
contracts
as
you
exhale
bring
your
focus
now
to
your
stomach
and
as
you
breathe
in
bring
the
breath
here
so
that
it
bloats
with
each
inhalation
and
as
you
exhale
feel
your
stomach
contract
you
[
Music
]
so
in
a
few
more
moments
I
'm
going
to
direct
your
breath
by
asking
you
to
inhale
and
to
exhale
to
a
slow
count
of
three
ready
inhale
one
one-thousand
two
one-thousand
three
one-thousand
exhale
one
one-thousand
two
one-thousand
three
one-thousand
inhale
1
2
3
exhale
1
2
3
inhale
exhale
now
trying
to
keep
this
pattern
of
slower
breathing
for
the
remainder
of
this
meditation
just
slowing
it
down
naturally
you
do
n't
have
to
mentally
count
each
breath
but
just
seeing
if
you
can
keep
it
nice
and
slow
and
steady
maintain
your
focus
on
breathing
into
your
stomach
so
it
expands
with
each
in-breath
and
contracts
with
each
out
breath
you
can
visualize
that
your
stomach
is
a
balloon
that
grows
and
shrinks
with
each
inhalation
and
exhalation
you
you
still
maintaining
the
pace
of
your
breath
think
back
to
an
incident
where
you
put
a
smile
on
someone
's
face
now
you
do
n't
have
to
remember
their
names
all
that
matters
is
that
you
made
someone
happy
and
that
you
did
it
with
no
thought
of
getting
something
back
it
does
n't
have
to
be
something
major
it
could
be
something
as
simple
as
holding
the
door
open
for
someone
or
giving
a
child
a
piece
of
candy
or
offering
someone
a
sincere
compliment
that
made
their
day
now
if
several
incidents
come
to
mind
pick
the
one
where
the
recipient
of
your
kindness
expressed
a
genuine
gratitude
can
you
remember
what
they
said
or
what
they
did
just
dwell
in
that
memory
for
a
few
moments
and
try
to
recall
as
much
detail
as
you
can
[
Music
]
do
you
remember
how
you
felt
in
that
moment
did
the
other
person
's
reaction
surprised
you
maybe
it
made
you
feel
good
maintain
your
even
breathing
but
just
keep
that
memory
and
enjoy
the
feeling
I
'd
like
you
now
to
remember
a
time
when
someone
did
you
a
kind
Act
preferably
one
that
you
so
badly
needed
but
never
expected
now
again
you
do
n't
have
to
know
the
person
's
name
or
even
remember
the
details
of
their
face
just
try
to
recall
as
much
of
the
incident
as
you
can
did
it
happen
at
night
or
during
the
day
what
happened
just
before
the
person
or
persons
came
along
did
you
ask
for
help
or
did
they
just
volunteer
to
help
what
did
they
do
to
help
you
do
you
remember
how
you
felt
in
that
moment
did
you
feel
surprised
grateful
did
you
express
your
gratitude
if
so
how
did
it
make
you
feel
valued
noticed
no
longer
invisible
that
there
are
indeed
good
people
in
the
world
just
take
a
moment
to
explore
that
memory
and
to
relive
what
you
felt
still
maintaining
the
slow
even
pace
of
your
breath
I
'd
like
you
to
consider
the
following
thought
the
gratitude
you
've
felt
toward
another
was
the
same
gratitude
that
another
felt
toward
you
it
might
be
a
feeling
of
lightness
and
peace
one
where
the
world
seemed
right
even
if
only
for
a
moment
but
the
person
to
whom
you
were
kind
they
too
felt
what
you
are
now
feeling
that
the
world
seemed
right
because
they
were
good
and
kind
people
in
it
people
like
you
no
matter
what
your
situation
is
like
no
matter
the
state
of
your
finances
or
relationships
no
matter
the
state
of
your
health
or
the
demands
on
your
time
and
attention
this
power
to
be
good
and
kind
can
never
be
taken
from
you
if
you
but
hold
on
to
it
no
matter
how
much
or
how
little
you
have
no
matter
your
state
of
mind
or
how
you
feel
this
power
to
be
good
and
kind
can
never
be
taken
from
you
if
you
hold
on
to
it
no
matter
what
your
country
's
social
political
or
economic
situation
is
like
and
how
it
affects
you
this
power
to
be
good
and
kind
can
never
be
taken
from
you
you
hold
on
to
it
by
understanding
that
this
is
your
innate
nature
that
's
why
it
feels
so
good
because
it
's
your
default
State
this
is
how
you
came
into
the
world
and
how
you
may
have
spent
the
first
years
of
your
life
until
you
grew
older
and
forgot
your
true
nature
you
are
not
your
gender
nor
your
sexuality
nor
your
job
nor
your
economic
status
nor
your
nationality
or
political
affiliation
you
are
yourself
a
being
filled
with
love
with
light
with
peace
and
joy
you
are
a
person
who
seeks
happiness
and
miracles
and
wants
it
for
others
as
well
because
you
know
that
this
is
the
default
State
for
everyone
your
pain
is
the
result
of
knowing
this
truth
but
seeing
another
that
's
why
you
come
alive
when
someone
shows
you
kindness
because
it
reminds
you
of
their
innate
nature
and
that
's
why
you
feel
powerful
and
validated
when
you
show
kindness
to
another
because
it
is
a
reminder
of
your
own
innate
nature
you
may
not
be
the
CEO
of
a
major
company
or
the
ruler
of
a
powerful
country
but
you
have
a
power
similar
to
theirs
the
power
to
change
the
lives
of
others
and
it
begins
with
one
thought
that
I
am
good
and
therefore
have
the
power
to
demonstrate
the
goodness
or
to
withhold
it
it
begins
with
one
act
the
power
to
sit
or
stand
up
straight
and
undefeated
confident
in
understanding
of
your
own
innate
goodness
finally
it
projects
itself
with
one
simple
but
sincere
smile
one
that
makes
you
feel
good
and
because
you
feel
good
you
pass
that
feeling
on
to
another
changing
another
's
day
for
the
better
by
making
them
feel
the
same
and
when
another
person
feels
good
they
pass
on
that
feeling
on
to
another
who
passes
it
on
to
another
and
so
on
continuing
a
chain
reaction
that
began
with
you
so
you
do
have
a
tremendous
power
one
that
could
potentially
affect
millions
and
indeed
change
the
world
for
the
better
knowing
this
you
can
not
possibly
be
as
helpless
or
as
powerless
as
you
have
let
yourself
believe
understanding
this
you
can
live
each
day
with
an
upright
posture
a
kind
smile
upon
your
face
and
creating
miracles
there
are
millions
out
there
whose
dahi
depends
on
you
and
because
their
day
depends
on
you
so
do
their
lives
and
the
lives
of
others
let
go
of
your
limitations
and
accept
your
own
power
and
responsibility
to
shape
the
world
into
a
better
and
more
positive
place
it
first
begins
with
you
rest
well
my
friend
rest
well
and
go
out
create
miracles
change
your
life
and
at
the
same
time
changing
the
lives
of
others

you
[
Music

hello
and
welcome
to
this
loving-kindness
meditation
prior
to
sleep
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
I
will
be
taking
you
on
this
journey
though
this
meditation
was
originally
used
in
Buddhism
you
do
n't
have
to
be
a
Buddhist
to
make
it
work
for
you
nor
do
you
have
to
subscribe
to
any
religion
or
belief
in
Supernatural
love
and
kindness
are
wonderful
things
but
often
we
feel
anything
but
sometimes
it
's
easier
to
feel
anger
and
hate
but
author
Jonathan
Lockwood
who
he
also
known
as
the
philosopher
of
happiness
put
it
best
when
he
said
forgive
others
not
because
they
deserve
your
forgiveness
but
because
you
deserve
peace
now
unfortunately
that
's
often
easier
said
than
done
but
fortunately
this
meditation
can
help
you
so
let's
begin
so
please
sitting
upright
but
comfortably
so
if
you
'd
like
to
rest
your
back
against
something
that
's
fine
just
do
n't
slouch
or
lean
back
because
doing
so
will
affect
your
breathing
and
if
you
want
to
lie
down
and
do
this
before
you
drift
off
to
sleep
that
's
okay
to
just
rest
your
hands
palms
face
up
on
your
lap
or
or
by
your
side
if
you
're
lying
down
now
close
your
eyes
and
focus
on
your
breathing
it
's
alright
if
thoughts
and
images
come
in
so
long
as
you
keep
most
of
your
attention
on
your
breath
you
're
doing
fine
when
you
see
a
thought
allow
it
to
be
do
n't
try
and
push
it
down
but
you
simply
shift
your
focus
back
to
your
breathing
I
want
you
to
remember
a
time
when
you
did
a
kind
thing
for
someone
it
does
n't
have
to
be
dramatic
but
I
have
two
conditions
the
first
is
that
you
did
it
without
a
thought
of
a
reward
or
an
influence
to
that
person
and
the
second
is
that
you
did
n't
later
regret
what
you
did
just
reflecting
on
that
do
you
remember
how
it
felt
did
it
feel
good
did
you
feel
proud
of
yourself
did
it
bring
a
smile
to
your
face
[
Music
]
if
you
're
smiling
now
that
's
all
good
that
feeling
stems
from
a
core
goodness
within
yourself
now
I
want
you
to
try
to
remember
what
you
looked
like
as
a
child
the
younger
the
better
that
child
you
were
for
all
their
faults
and
mischievousness
deserved
patience
and
understanding
that
child
you
were
also
deserved
loved
could
you
see
yourself
wanting
to
protect
and
provide
for
that
child
[
Music
]
could
you
see
yourself
wanting
to
hold
and
comfort
that
child
just
explore
this
thought
for
a
moment
[
Music
]
you
you
now
if
you
can
just
mentally
repeat
after
me
for
all
the
ways
that
I
harm
myself
negate
doubt
belittle
myself
judge
or
be
unkind
to
myself
through
my
own
confusions
I
forgive
myself
and
if
there
is
a
situation
I
am
not
yet
ready
to
forgive
I
forgive
myself
for
that
too
may
I
feel
loving-kindness
may
I
be
filled
with
loving-kindness
may
I
be
held
in
loving
kindness
may
I
be
happy
and
peaceful
may
I
appreciate
the
gift
of
just
being
alive
[
Music
]
I
'd
like
you
now
to
bring
to
mind
someone
you
love
dearly
it
could
be
a
parent
a
child
a
friend
or
even
someone
who
's
passed
away
can
you
remember
their
faces
how
they
move
[
Music
]
do
you
know
why
you
love
that
person
can
you
remember
the
things
they
did
to
earn
your
love
how
do
you
feel
or
how
did
you
feel
when
they
were
around
you
what
does
your
love
feel
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
exploring
this
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
you
[
Music
]
imagine
there
in
front
of
you
now
and
mentally
repeat
after
me
if
I
have
harmed
you
in
any
way
either
knowingly
or
unknowingly
through
my
own
confusions
I
ask
your
forgiveness
if
there
is
a
situation
you
are
not
yet
ready
to
forgive
me
for
I
will
be
patient
you
have
harmed
me
too
perhaps
knowingly
or
unknowingly
through
your
own
confusions
but
I
forgive
you
and
if
there
is
a
situation
I
am
not
yet
ready
to
forgive
you
for
please
be
patient
[
Music
]
may
you
feel
loving-kindness
may
you
be
filled
with
loving-kindness
[
Music
]
may
you
be
held
in
loving-kindness
may
you
be
happy
and
peaceful
may
you
appreciate
the
gift
of
just
being
alive
[
Music
]
now
please
try
to
hold
on
to
that
love
and
think
of
someone
you
neither
like
nor
dislike
it
could
be
your
mailman
a
co-worker
or
simply
you
see
someone
every
day
but
have
never
spoken
to
[
Music
]
can
you
remember
their
faces
how
they
move
what
they
sound
like
if
you
've
spoken
to
them
now
your
love
might
be
weakening
a
little
at
the
moment
try
to
hold
on
to
that
love
you
felt
for
the
other
person
as
you
picture
this
new
one
[
Music

what
if
you
knew
that
this
person
has
children
they
love
very
much
children
they
'd
be
willing
to
suffer
for
would
that
change
your
feelings
about
them
consider
that
they
may
have
pain
and
suffering
but
they
might
also
want
happiness
for
themselves
and
those
they
love
might
that
warm
you
toward
them
a
little
imagine
that
they
could
be
kind
to
you
if
you
gave
them
a
chance
does
the
thought
of
loving
them
with
the
same
intensity
still
seem
strange
can
you
imagine
the
possibility
of
it
could
you
fake
it
a
little
could
you
try
to
feel
the
love
you
felt
for
the
other
person
and
keep
this
new
person
's
face
in
mind
just
try
to
explore
this
thought
over
the
next
few
moments
[

[

[

you
[

[

[

mentally
repeat
after
me
may
you
feel
loving-kindness
may
you
be
filled
with
loving-kindness
may
be
held
in
loving-kindness
may
you
be
happy
and
peaceful
may
you
appreciate
the
gift
of
just
being
alive
whatever
living
beings
there
may
be
may
they
all
have
happy
minds
may
I
not
deceive
another
nor
despise
anyone
anywhere
even
when
angry
or
upset
[
Music

may
I
not
wish
ill
upon
another
just
as
the
mother
would
protect
her
only
child
with
her
life
even
so
mayor
cultivate
a
boundless
love
towards
all
beings
may
I
radiate
boundless
love
towards
the
entire
world
unhindered
without
ill-will
without
enmity
I
'd
like
you
to
go
back
now
and
remember
the
person
you
love
so
much
picture
their
faces
and
imagine
that
they
're
with
you
remember
what
it
feels
like
when
they
're
present
and
rest
in
that
thought
for
the
next
few
moments
[
Music

and
now
the
hard
part
bring
to
mind
someone
you
dislike
it
does
n't
matter
why
you
dislike
or
hate
them
but
could
even
be
someone
you
've
never
met
perhaps
some
public
figure
whose
blood
makes
you
boil
for
some
other
reason
if
there
's
no
such
person
in
your
life
think
of
someone
you
've
recently
had
a
spat
with
and
are
still
upset
with
I'm
going
to
assume
you
've
brought
up
someone
you
dislike
let
your
emotions
come
but
do
n't
try
to
justify
them
simply
let
the
experience
of
dislike
come
as
your
heart
beat
faster
is
a
dialogue
now
coming
into
your
header
along
the
lines
of
I
should
have
said
this
or
I
should
have
done
that
focus
on
your
breathing
but
do
n't
let
the
feelings
go
[
Music

you
I
want
you
to
imagine
what
this
person
you
dislike
might
look
like
as
a
child
long
before
they
created
whatever
drama
it
is
that
upsets
you
so
much
try
to
create
some
emotional
distance
and
imagine
how
they
might
act
as
a
child
perhaps
when
they
were
three
or
four
[
Music

visualize
a
small
of
them
with
a
higher
pitched
voice
and
a
face
without
whatever
expression
that
annoys
you
so
much
[

[

could
you
see
yourself
hating
this
imaginary
child
if
this
child
were
hurt
or
upset
could
you
see
yourself
wanting
to
pick
them
up
perhaps
hugging
them
to
give
them
some
comfort
if
you
saw
this
child
alone
and
scared
could
you
see
yourself
walking
away

what
could
you
see
yourself
putting
aside
your
own
feelings
to
comfort
someone
in
the
midst
of
their
own
pain
and
suffering
[
Music

now
imagine
this
person
as
they
are
now
if
you
saw
them
alone
and
scared
far
away
from
wherever
it
is
you
have
to
interact
with
them
if
you
saw
them
vulnerable
suffering
and
in
pain
and
know
that
this
is
that
same
child
you
would
have
comforted
could
you
still
dislike
or
hate
them
with
the
same
intensity
or
could
you
see
yourself
softening
a
little
[
Music

if
you
could
see
this
person
holding
a
little
child
tenderly
perhaps
comforting
that
child
could
you
see
yourself
softening
a
little
more
could
you
be
a
little
less
angry
or
upset
with
such
a
person
if
you
could
talk
to
the
child
this
person
was
what
would
you
say
[

you
you

mentally
repeat
after
me
if
I
have
harmed
you
in
any
way
either
knowingly
or

through
my
own
confusions
I
ask
your
forgiveness
if
there
is

hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
the
deserving
and
manifesting
abundance
guided
meditation
[
Music
]
it
is
the
innate
tendency
of
nature
to
grow
and
become
more
to
produce
more
and
create
more
of
everything
there
are
always
babies
being
born
new
trees
sprouting
new
plants
growing
new
things
are
constantly
being
invented
cars
produced
houses
being
built
jobs
created
and
new
technologies
being
developed
on
a
daily
basis
all
around
us
the
universe
is
always
expanding
and
growing
just
as
abundance
is
everywhere
in
the
universe
it
can
also
appear
in
your
personal
life
if
you
intend
it
and
allow
it
to
be
you
may
not
feel
you
have
access
to
this
abundance
you
may
think
you
a
li
innate
yourself
from
it
and
prevent
it
from
manifesting
in
your
life
well
it
's
time
to
change
that
tract
abundance
into
your
life
you
need
to
feel
abundant
you
must
believe
you
are
worthy
and
deserving
of
great
abundance
you
have
to
develop
an
abundance
consciousness
abundance
consciousness
means
becoming
aware
of
the
existence
of
abundance
of
feeling
it
in
your
life
and
of
connecting
with
it
even
if
it
does
n't
seem
to
be
a
part
of
your
life
at
this
moment
this
kind
of
consciousness
means
feeling
and
believing
that
you
are
a
part
of
it
you
are
surrounded
by
it
abundance
lives
within
you
intending
it
and
releasing
it
out
into
the
universe
is
all
we
need
to
begin
with
abundance
consciousness
breaks
through
the
limiting
beliefs
of
your
mind
and
opens
you
to
wider
opportunities
and
a
wider
point
of
view
so
now
let
's
get
comfortable
and
allow
ourselves
the
time
and
space
to
relax
and
manifest
abundance
in
our
lives
you
so
finding
a
comfortable
place
either
sitting
or
lying
down
that
you
wo
n't
be
disturbed
for
the
next
20
minutes
or
so
and
closing
your
eyes
your
arms
can
be
placed
beside
you
and
begin
this
meditation
by
taking
in
three
deep
breaths
in
through
the
nose
sending
that
breath
all
the
way
down
and
releasing
it
letting
it
go
feeling
that
breath
rise
all
the
way
up
and
out
and
return
your
breathing
back
to
normal
change
it
just
being
aware
of
it
in
feeling
that
stomach
expand
as
you
breathe
in
breath
out
feel
your
stomach
contract
just
be
in
this
moment
and
be
aware
of
this
breathing
for
a
few
moments
and
I
will
return
if
a
thought
arises
during
this
time
simply
go
back
to
focusing
on
your
breathing
it
's
all
okay
it
's
a
part
of
the
process
of
meditation

as
dark
as
possible
create
the
most
comfortable
environment
that
you
can
feel
free
to
pause
this
recording
if
you
need
to
make
any
further
adjustments
now
that
you
have
prepared
your
surroundings
and
settled
in
for
the
night
welcome
a
sense
of
relaxation
and
peace
into
your
mind
and
body
close
your
eyes
and
allow
my
voice
to
be
your
guide
into
relaxation
invite
in
the
sensation
of
relaxation
as
if
you
are
welcoming
an
old
friend
take
a
deep
inhale
through
your
nose
and
let
out
a
relaxing
sigh
through
your
mouth
let
your
body
sink
into
bed
and
make
any
further
adjustments
necessary
to
become
as
comfortable
as
possible
now
take
another
slow
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
letting
it
out
with
a
sigh
and
sink
down
just
a
bit
further
into
the
surface
below
you
you
can
drift
off
into
sleep
when
your
body
is
ready
there
is
no
need
to
listen
to
everything
I
say
let
relaxation
and
sleep
come
to
you
easily
welcoming
a
slowing
down
of
the
momentum
of
your
energy
to
gradually
find
stillness
now
begin
to
count
your
breath
in
and
as
you
breathe
out
encourage
your
exhale
to
be
one
count
longer
than
your
inhale
allow
each
exhale
to
carry
away
with
it
any
physical
and
emotional
stress
or
tension
by
exhaling
longer
than
you
inhale
your
breath
will
slow
and
your
body
will
calm
down
continue
breathing
with
an
extended
exhale
for
a
few
breaths
cycles
now
enjoy
the
easy
flow
of
your
natural
breath
feel
the
cool
air
as
it
passes
into
your
nostrils
and
fills
you
up
[

allowing
each
natural
out-breath
to
release
any
tension
that
you
may
be
feeling
continue
to
observe
your
breath
and
allow
it
to
naturally
slow
down
become
aware
of
your
physical
experience
with
your
minds
I
notice
first
the
palms
of
your
hands
notice
the
energy
here
perhaps
you
feel
this
as
warmth
or
tingling
or
maybe
a
buzzing
sensation
notice
how

part
of
your
body
moves
your
energy
to
this
point
by
simply
paying
attention

have
the
ability
to
move
energy
and

into

sensations
of

right
here

now
[

can
sense
your
own
physical
experience
you
are
in
the
present

is
attentive
to
the
sensations

you
can
pause
you
can
extend
the
gap
between
your
thoughts
this
gap
is
where
you
can
experience
peace
and
calm
notice
now
if
there
is
anywhere
you
can
soften
a
little
more
look
for
anywhere
you
can
let
go
even
deeper
into
relaxation

ease

let
this
idea

knowledge
be
a
comfort
to
you
to
allow
your
thoughts
to
drift
down
the
flowing
river
of
thoughts
as
you
observe
them
as
you
let
your

may
find
it
helpful
to
name
these
thoughts
as
they
arise
identify
them
as
a
way
to
simply
be
aware
of
thinking
after
they
have
been
named
witness
them
as

and
fall
away

matter
how

sensations
in

body
notice

if
we
resist
the
current
of
the
flowing
river
of
thoughts
it
will
continue
to
rush
against
us
pushing
in
opposition
perhaps
giving
you
the
feeling
of
being
stuck
if
we
accept
it
allow
it
we
drift
effortlessly
along
with
the
current
[

the
awareness
of
your
thoughts
allows
you
to
let
go
of
the
hold
they
may
have
on
you
continue
noticing
your
thoughts
as
they
arise
and
allow
them
to
drift
away
you
may
even
notice
your
thoughts
coming
with
more
space
between
them
when
you
practice
allowing
them
to
rise
and
fall
as
with
the
cycle
of
the
breath
if
you
find
you
get
swept
up
with
a
thought
with
compassion
and
patience
bring
your
awareness
back
to
the
sensations
of
your
body
now
allow
yourself
to
go
deeper
still
allow
all
of
the
thoughts
to
go
let
your
scanning
awareness
drift
off
simply
be
present
with
your
truest
self
letting
all
the
layers
of
yourself
dissolve
let
what
seemed
like
boundaries
blur
since
a
place
inside
of
you
that
is
the
place
of
your
inner
wisdom
your
intuition
here
inside
you
is
where
your
present
awareness
and
insights
reside
when

pause
and
simply

hello
and
welcome
to
this
short
mindfulness
meditation
to
help
increase
your
awareness
of
both
breath
and
body
in
this
present
moment
my
name
is
jason
stevenson
and
i
invite
you
to
simply
follow
my
words
of
guidance
as
we
move
through
this
meditation
and
know
that
there
is
nothing
you
need
to
know
and
no
experience
you
need
to
have
in
order
to
practice
this
so
to
begin
just
take
a
moment
to
let
yourself
come
to
a
comfortable
seated
position
or
lying
down
if
that's
comfortable
for
you
you
can
be
in
a
chair
on
the
bench
seated
on
the
floor
or
whatever
is
most
comfortable
and
wherever
you
find
yourself
just
take
a
moment
to
check
in
with
your
posture
ensuring
that
your
spine
and
neck
form
one
straight
line
and
your
shoulders
are
relaxed
just
rest
your
hands
in
your
lap
your
knees
or
your
thighs
and
then
close
your
eyes
if
you
've
not
done
so
now
take
a
few
silent
moments
to
let
your
mind
arrive
in
this
present
moment
[
Music
]
often
when
we
go
into
meditation
it
takes
the
mind
a
few
moments
to
settle
in
to
let
go
of
its
attachment
to
the
past
or
its
ideas
about
the
future
you
can
help
it
to
arrive
by
simply
tuning
into
the
surface
beneath
you
noting
what
it
feels
like
to
be
held
by
gravity
against
the
floor
or
the
chair
below
you
once
you
feel
firmly
grounded
and
connected
to
the
earth
beneath
you
just
let
your
attention
shift
gently
towards
the
breath
without
looking
for
anything
in
particular
in
the
breath
's
flow
simply
observe
its
movement
into
and
out
of
your
body
you
might
notice
the
temperature
of
the
surrounding
air
as
it
enters
your
nostrils
or
the
feeling
of
the
body
expanding
and
contracting
with
each
breath
cycle
if
you
notice
the
mind
wandering
at
any
point
simply
notice
this
movement
with
patience
curiosity
and
compassion
and
note
that
it
's
entirely
natural
for
the
mind
to
wander
so
practice
non-judgment
when
you
notice
that
this
is
occurring
just
silently
invite
your
attention
back
to
the
breath
when
you
notice
that
thoughts
have
pulled
your
attention
away
[
Music
]
now
i
invite
you
to
let
your
attention
and
your
awareness
broaden
to
hold
your
entire
physical
body
within
the
scope
of
its
lens
notice
what
it
feels
like
to
be
here
to
fully
occupy
your
physical
being
in
this
moment
[
Music
]
just
as
was
the
case
when
you
observe
the
breath
there
is
nothing
unusual
or
particular
you
need
to
look
for
tuning
into
the
body
is
a
process
of
simply
connecting
with
the
subtle
sensations
of
being
alive
you
might
notice
tingling
tension
contraction
or
expansion
or
even
numbness
or
any
other
barely
traceable
sensations
just
simply
notice
what
is
here
inside
of
you
[
Music
]
now
let
your
attention
focus
in
on
a
single
sensation
you
may
have
come
to
observe
if
nothing
has
stood
out
to
you
simply
let
your
awareness
land
on
either
the
heart
space
or
your
third
eye
area
just
in
the
middle
of
your
brows
[
Music
]
whatever
point
of
the
body
your
attention
has
landed
on
i
invite
you
just
to
stay
with
that
notice
what
is
there
and
even
if
that
feels
like
numbness
or
emptiness
just
notice
be
with
it
and
refrain
from
judging
any
sensations
as
good
or
bad
just
watch
with
openness
and
just
see
what
happens
[
Music
]
if
or
when
the
sensation
dissolves
just
gently
shift
your
focus
to
another
single
point
in
the
body
alternatively
you
can
stay
exactly
where
you
are
continuing
to
be
present
with
that
original
point
of
interest
[
Music
]
now
i
invite
you
to
consider
is
there
any
part
of
your
body
that
might
be
yearning
for
some
love
or
attention
and
let
your
attention
on
that
place
or
stay
where
it
is
at
the
present
and
then
imagine
as
if
you
are
breathing
nourishing
energy
into
that
part
of
your
body
with
each
breath
so
with
each
inhalation
you
might
envision
a
gold
healing
light
being
sent
to
that
area
of
your
attention
and
with
each
breath
out
you
might
envision
that
same
light
carrying
away
any
tension
or
stagnant
energy
[
Music
]
inhale
loving
energy
to
nurture
this
single
point
in
your
physical
body
and
exhale
all
tension
away
now
i
invite
you
to
broaden
your
awareness
once
again
slowly
expanding
your
attention
to
hold
your
entire
physical
body
and
then
continue
to
inhale
those
loving
breaths
or
that
golden
light
letting
each
breath
nurture
every
cell
of
your
body
just
imagine
that
your
entire
body
each
cell
each
muscle
and
each
organ
is
breathing
in
and
out
now
soften
your
forehead
relax
your
belly
and
then
slowly
let
all
visuals
fade
as
you
come
back
to
the
natural
flow
of
your
breath
and
ground
yourself
once
again
in
the
surface
beneath
you
and
when
you
were
ready
to
close
this
practice
slowly
open
your
eyes
[
Music
]
and
as
you
move
through
your
day
remember
that
you
can
always
come
back
to
the
immediate
sensations
of
your
breath
and
body
to
find
peace
presence
and
grounding

hello
and
welcome
to
this
short
guided
meditation
to
help
you
start
your
day
on
the
right
note
by
setting
an
intention
and
visualizing
how
you
would
like
your
day
to
unfold
to
begin
this
practice
take
a
moment
to
find
a
comfortable
seated
position
and
however
you
find
yourself
seated
elongate
your
spine
as
if
your
crown
of
the
head
is
touching
up
towards
the
morning
sun
and
allowing
your
shoulders
to
drop
and
your
chest
to
open
gently
closing
your
eyes
if
you
have
n't
already
done
so
and
then
take
a
few
moments
to
check
in
with
your
natural
ebb
and
flow
of
your
breathing
and
just
notice
if
there
's
any
restrictions
or
contraction
that
is
inhibiting
your
breath
from
flowing
into
the
fullness
of
your
lungs
and
where
it
is
possible
for
you
to
consciously
shift
this
see
where
you
might
invite
increased
softness
or
surrender
into
your
physical
body
[
Music
]
you
might
relax
the
belly
the
jaw
or
your
shoulders
to
facilitate
the
flow
of
this
life
force
and
now
before
we
begin
our
intention
setting
and
visualization
practice
let
's
just
take
three
long
deep
breaths
together
and
begin
by
emptying
your
lungs
all
of
it
and
take
a
full
deep
breath
into
the
belly
for
a
count
of
four
pause
for
a
second
at
the
top
and
then
slowly
let
it
go
for
a
count
of
four
another
slow
deep
breath
in
brief
pause
at
the
top
and
then
completely
release
as
you
breathe
out
one
more
full
deep
nourishing
breath
in
and
brief
pause
and
then
release
with
a
soft
sigh
as
you
exhale
and
just
let
the
breath
continue
to
flow
naturally
as
it
awakens
you
to
this
day
ahead
now
i
invite
you
to
take
a
silent
moment
to
tune
in
with
your
heart
as
you
reflect
upon
what
intention
you
would
like
to
set
for
your
day
it
might
be
to
move
forward
with
courage
and
confidence
to
be
loving
and
compassionate
with
those
you
interact
with
maybe
to
feel
grounded
and
centered
in
your
being
or
anything
else
that
feels
true
to
your
most
authentic
self
this
morning
[
Music
]
and
whatever
it
is
take
a
moment
to
silently
formulate
that
intention
into
a
single
sentence
and
then
silently
repeat
it
to
yourself
slowly
with
heartfulness
and
commitment
and
know
that
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
intention
to
set
so
you
do
n't
have
to
overthink
it
just
let
whatever
arises
from
within
your
heart
and
be
led
by
that
now
with
this
intention
in
mind
and
with
your
commitment
to
embody
it
in
each
minute
an
hour
that
unfolds
i
invite
you
to
visualize
your
next
few
steps
upon
finishing
this
meditation
where
will
you
go
next
and
what
energy
will
you
travel
with
there
how
will
your
body
and
mind
feel
as
you
move
through
the
morning
with
your
intention
radiating
out
from
within
you
picture
how
you
will
stand
how
you
will
walk
what
you
will
wear
and
which
qualities
you
will
carry
with
you
and
then
follow
your
steps
even
further
into
the
future
what
will
your
late
morning
look
like
your
lunch
hour
or
your
early
afternoon
consider
any
interactions
you
will
have
the
effortless
moments
the
potential
challenges
and
the
simple
moments
in
between

yourself
navigate
all
of
these
moments
with
grace
ease
and
authenticity
as
you
visualize
yourself
moving
through
the
day
notice
how
it
feels
to
be
you
to
be
the
you
who
lives
in
alignment
with
your
highest
intent
let
this
energy
embed
itself
in
each
cell
of
your
being
as
you
watch
yourself
effortlessly
moving
forward
through
the
day
consider
next
how
you
will
transition
into
late
afternoon
and
evening
what
interactions
do
you
expect
to
have
if
there
are
any
obstacles
you
imagine
might
cross
your
path
know
that
you
have
within
you
what
it
takes
to
navigate
these
as
best
as
can
be
done
let
your
intention
and
the
vision
of
your
higher
self
guide
your
steps
forward
spend
just
a
few
final
moments
visualizing
any
important
details
about
the
day
ahead
and
then
empower
these
visions
with
trust
faith
and
confidence
in
yourself

and
when

will
quickly
notice
any
tiredness
or
tensions
affecting
it

you
review
your
day
perhaps
you
notice
some
agitation
or
perhaps
all
stays
calm
perhaps
some
smiles
perhaps
some
frowns
keep
allowing
your
body
to
relax
and
sing
softly
to
yourself
I
have
come
to
release
this
day
I
allow
myself
to
notice
my
feelings
with
no
judgments
keep
focusing
on
the
events
of
the
day
as
you
gently
breathe
in
and
breathe
out
notice
any
emotions
that
might
emerge
with
your
attention
allow
them
to
flow
through
you
as
you
breathe
in
and
a
way
as
you
breathe
out
say
to
yourself
as
I
allow
my
emotions
to
be
acknowledged
by
my
breath
I
also
allow
them
to
leave
me
in
letting
go
I
release
myself
from
any
hidden
grip
they
had
on
me
notice
any
parts
of
your
day
that
were
difficult
did
you
judge
yourself
at
the
time
notice
that
judgments
are
just
thoughts
they
are
not
real
you
can
allow
them
to
flow
down
to
the
surface
of
your
mind
and
then
they
took
flow
away
with
your
god
brats
breathing
light
from
the
moon
or
from
source
and
let
them
light
and
the
love
it
carries
disperse
those
self
judgments
and
difficulties
allow
yourself
to
separate
from
them
and
be
free
notice
if
there
were
any
times
during
the
day
when
you
judged
others
say
their
names
inside
your
head
and
send
light
unto
them
have
faith
in
the
light
and
the
letting
go
you
have
given
yourself
a
gift
by
letting
go
of
their
energy
and
letting
yourself
flow
onwards
go
to
the
place
in
your
mind
that
way
she
has
meant
something
today
it
happened
differently
just
focus
on
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
your
mind
in
your
imagination
run
it
like
a
video
with
the
ending
you
wanted
to
have
Duncan
could
have
been
rewriting
every
bit
of
dialogue
just
focus
on
imagining
the
ending
you
wanted
and
to
know
that
the
dead
ending
included
the
best
possible
outcome
for
everyone
involved
breathe
easily
into
this
outcome

is
intended
Mari

go
for
the
universe

attend
to
as

attention
glides
through
your
day

the
part
of
it
that
gave

most
joy

namastegetting
upset
about
pain
does
n't
take
it
away
thinking
about
and
replaying
the
past
does
n't
give
you
the
ability
to
change
what
has
already
occurred
worrying
wishing
and
hoping
things
were
different
does
n't
make
anything
actually
change
today
let
go
of
the
events
of
the
day
and
surrender
into
a
deep
tranquil
sleep
give
yourself
permission
to
simply
let
go
into
your
own
inner
peace
and
self-healing
through
acceptance
and
surrender

is
a
pleasure
to
be
your
guide
today
I
'm
Sara
Raymond
welcome
to
the
mindful
movement
here
we
are
an
oasis
where
you
can
come
to
tap
into
your
inner
peace
positive
mindset
and
the
ability
for
self
healing
as
we
begin
to
settle
in
for
this
sleep
meditation
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
as
comfortable
as
possible
close
your
eyes
and
allow
my
voice
to
be
your
guide
into
deep
healing
relaxation
give
yourself
permission
to
let
go
into
the
darkness
of
sleep
for
the
night
give
yourself
the
gift
of
healing
rest
and
know
deep
down
that
you
deserve
it
allow
yourself
the
opportunity
to
relax
in
stillness
create
a
safe
and
tranquil
environment
for
yourself
making
sure
you
are
all
set
to
drift
off
into
sleep
invite
into
your
body
and
mind
a
sense
of
relaxation
and
peace
you
can
drift
off
to
sleep
when
you
are
ready
there
is
no
need
to
listen
to
everything
I
say
let
relaxation
and
sleep
come
to
you
easily
welcoming
a
slowing
down
of
the
momentum
of
your
energy
to
gradually
find
stillness
begin
to
connect
with
your
breath
and
if
it
feels
right
to
you
take
a
long
slow
deep
breath
in
hold
it
for
a
moment
and
then
slowly
exhale
fully
empty
out
and
allow
any
tension
to
melt
away
as
you
gradually
relax
more
and
more
deeply
with
each
breath
as
you
continue
to
breathe
intentionally
allow
your
exhale
to
be
slightly
longer
than
your
inhale
to
welcome
ease
and
relaxation
to
flow
throughout
your
entire
body
[
Music
]
take
another
long
slow
deep
breath
in
pausing
again
and
then
exhale
empty
your
lungs
completely
with
your
out-breath
[
Music
]
and
again
take
a
deep
breath
in
to
signal
to
your
body
and
mind
that
it
is
your
time
to
fully
relax
take
your
time
hold
for
a
moment
and
then
let
it
go
perhaps
you
can
already
feel
yourself
drifting
into
a
deep
state
of
relaxation
like
the
leaves
being
released
from
the
trees
in
the
season
of
fall
you
can
let
go
to
make
room
for
new
possibilities
to
develop
and
present
themselves
in
your
life
[
Music

consider
each
breath
out
as
a
time
for
releasing
any
unwanted
energies
and
allowing
the
energy
that
you
do
desire
to
develop
within
you
this
is
your
time
to
heal
and
to
let
go
with
each
exhale
let
go
of
any
tension
in
your
body
scan
for
areas
that
are
holding
on
to
something
and
give
yourself
permission
to
let
go
of
that
tension
with
each
exhale

to
gravity

go
of
any
resistance

with
each
exhale
let
go
and
soften
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
surface
below
you
allow
your
body
to
soften
a
little
deeper
now
allow
the
out-breath
to
exhale
tension
from
your

'll
let

list
that
may
be
taking
up
space
in
your
ID

yourself
permission
to
be
here
right
now
doing
just
this
sometimes
we
need
to
invite
the
idea
of
offering
ourselves
permission
in
order
to
let
go
of
the
past
give
yourself
some
space
space
for
something
new

to
grow
into
what

of
right
now
[

what
has
become
too
heavy
a
weight
to
bear
on
your
journey
[

like
the
falling
leaves
it
's
time
to
clear
out
and
free
yourself
of
things
you
may
have
been
afraid
to
let
go
of
in
the
past
without
the
falling

the

an
obstacle
if

practice
accepting
the

you
can
also
begin
to
practice
acceptance
and
surrender
in
other
areas

frequently
the
word
surrender
has
a
negative
energy
to
it
you
may
think
of
having
to
give
up
something
that
is
important
to
you
or
lose
control
over
a
situation
Surrender
does
not
mean
giving
up
when
the
word
surrender
is
used
as
a
mindfulness
practice
it
can
also
be
the
opportunity
to
give
up
anything
that
is
no
longer
serving
you
or
anything
that
is
keeping
you
stuck

when

the

may
add
suffering

the

this

you
you
you
you
you
you
youhello
and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
on
letting
go
and
sleep
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
I
will
be
taking
you
through
a
relaxation
before
hopefully
you
'll
be
having
an
immensely
satisfying
sleep
today
my
aim
is
to
assist
you
in
completely
letting
go
and
surrendering
before
sleep
before
we
begin
set
your
personal
space
up
for
this
wine
down
to
a
good
night's
sleep
put
away
all
distracting
items
and
power
down
all
your
devices
apart
from
the
one
on
which
you
are
playing
this
recording
you
may
wish
to
take
a
moment
to
jot
down
any
pending
tasks
which
can
wait
until
tomorrow
it
's
vital
to
incorporate
rest
into
your
busy
schedule
and
with
a
good
night
's
sleep
you
recharge
your
batteries
and
rejuvenate
your
spirit
for
a
great
day
ahead
so
without
further
adieu
lie
back
into
a
comfortable
position
allowing
your
body
to
adjust
your
mattress
feel
your
spine
settling
back
and
relaxing
rest
your
head
back
against
a
pillow
if
that
is
your
preference
and
just
savor
the
relief
of
simply
lying
back
after
an
active
day
if
you
have
n't
already
done
so
let
your
eyes
close
naturally
just
allow
the
eyelids
to
gently
come
together
no
need
to
squeeze
them
shut
and
forget
for
the
moment
about
trying
to
sleep
just
inhale
deeply
thinking
to
yourself
breathe
in
hold
your
breath
a
little
and
then
breathe
out
being
conscious
of
your
breath
as
our
breathing
comes
under
control
so
too
does
our
mind
it
's
not
about
trying
too
hard
to
control
your
breathing
instead
it
's
letting
it
occur
naturally
and
just
being
aware
of
it
you
on
your
next
breath
in
focus
on
the
center
of
your
forward
hold
your
breath
permitting
it
to
gently
soothe
your
forehead
like
a
bomb
and
relax
let
go
on
your
next
breath
in
feel
your
eyelids
become
soft
and
relaxed
and
as
you
exhale
notice
how
your
eyelids
get
heavier
and
heavier
as
they
welcome
sleep
on
your
next
breath
in
breathing
in
and
feel
cool
energy
to
your
cheeks
and
hold
your
breath
exhaling
feel
your
cheeks
lower
comfortably
like
they
just
drop
deeper
and
deeper
relaxed
on
your
next
breath
in
focusing
on
your
jaw
muscles
feel
your
teeth
come
apart
and
your
lower
jaw
drop
slightly
if
the
tip
of
your
tongue
is
stuck
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
let
it
fall
and
relax
next
bring
your
attention
to
your
neck
muscles
and
on
your
breath
in
energy
of
that
breath
to
need
away
at
your
neck
taking
the
strain
away
senior
Nick
further
on
your
next
breath
in
bringing
a
dose
of
relief
to
your
back
the
energy
run
along
your
spine
unwinding
all
the
knots
in
your
upper
and
lower
back
and
on
your
next
breath
out
allow
any
tension
or
aches
to
be
carried
away
with
this
strand
of
exhalation
feel
your
body
relaxing
deeper
and
deeper
now
breathe
in
again
and
bring
your
attention
to
chest
pulling
apart
all
the
knots
that
wind
your
chest
up
tired
and
breathe
out
and
savor
this
liberating
relief
of
deep
and
satisfying
relaxation
breathing
in
again
and
this
time
feeling
your
shoulders
let
go
they
drop
a
little
and
the
muscles
in
your
arms
your
biceps
and
triceps
and
into
the
forearms
feel
any
stress
in
this
area
melt
away
right
down
to
the
tips
of
your
fingers
you
breathing
in
again
and
sending
the
breath
right
down
to
your
abdomen
and
feel
it
expand
and
contract
as
you
breathe
out
just
letting
it
sink
back
in
naturally
and
sending
you
into
a
deeper
state
of
relaxation
introduce
some
of
that
relaxing
energy
to
your
legs
as
you
take
the
next
breath
in
upon
breathing
out
let
any
remaining
pressure
escape
through
the
tips
of
your
toes
and
your
outward
breath
you
through
the
breath
you
bring
balance
to
your
system
with
each
conscious
breath
you
become
more
and
more
aware
of
the
present
moment
very
moment
you
simply
are
you
are
perfect
you
are
whole
just
take
a
moment
now
to
observe
the
natural
flow
of
your
breathing
you
notice
how
with
each
breath
in
your
chest
izes
and
with
each
breath
out
it
falls
up
and
down
just
like
the
steadily
swinging
pendulum
of
life
you
bring
your
attention
to
this
precise
moment
to
struggle
or
to
force
yourself
to
do
this
by
simply
coming
back
to
your
breath
you
will
return
to
the
moment
and
become
aware
of
it
just
breathe
in
and
then
breathe
out
from
the
start
of
a
new
day
right
up
to
the
end
we
are
exposed
to
thousands
of
thoughts
do
n't
try
to
fight
your
thoughts
simply
observe
them
witness
them
and
then
coming
back
to
your
breath
slowly
let
those
thoughts
go
remember
breathe
in
and
breathe
out
you
may
find
yourself
thinking
about
a
particular
event
or
events
that
have
passed
slowing
down
the
thought
process
drift
among
those
memories
witness
them
from
above
and
recognize
them
tell
yourself
I
'm
thinking
about
this
event
I
acknowledge
it
and
as
you
breathe
out
move
along
with
the
breath
detaching
yourself
a
little
more
from
that
particular
thought
we
must
understand
that
we
can
not
change
the
past
that
we
can
learn
something
from
it
upon
a
lesson
you
might
have
learned
from
that
event
or
those
events
again
to
not
strain
yourself
to
think
of
the
lesson
simply
breathe
in
and
breathe
out
again
and
if
something
comes
to
mind
take
it
with
you
if
not
remain
with
the
breath
and
you
can
always
return
for
further
reflection
at
another
time
breathe
in
and
as
you
breathe
out
let
the
past
flow
through
your
system
and
out
to
become
one
with
the
universe
sometimes
we
are
overpowered
by
a
sense
of
anger
or
grief
and
that
in
turn
holds
us
back
if
this
is
the
case
view
now
if
any
of
these
thoughts
arise
just
breathe
in
focusing
on
that
breathing
breathing
afresh
energy
and
on
your
breath
out
becoming
fully
aware
of
your
breath
in
this
state
of
relaxation
your
mind
is
operating
at
a
slower
more
passive
frequency
you
are
hence
able
to
observe
these
feelings
of
anger
or
grief
without
letting
it
affect
you
a
moment
now
to
reflect
upon
this
did
not
try
too
hard
to
determine
the
source
of
it
simply
acknowledge
its
presence
and
then
return
to
the
breath
there
are
opportunities
to
become
angry
and
upset
every
now
and
again
however
it
's
important
to
remember
that
we
have
a
choice
of
whether
or
not
to
feed
these
emotions
and
by
merely
coming
back
to
the
breath
you
can
bring
yourself
back
into
alignment
you
can
choose
not
to
let
these
things
bother
you
they
are
not
worth
your
precious
time
if
you
have
any
anger
or
resentment
as
you
inhale
and
exhale
let
them
go
reminding
yourself
that
is
not
worth
giving
into
you
want
more
you
are
strong
our
belief
systems
can
sometimes
place
restrictions
on
us
however
we
can
all
make
the
choice
to
follow
what
we
truly
believe
in
make
yourself
aware
of
this
choice
through
the
bread
inhale
bring
into
your
system
that
things
that
are
most
important
to
you
bring
to
mind
what
you
most
value
in
your
life
and
as
you
breathe
out
let
go
of
those
feelings
that
do
not
resonate
with
you
and
that
hold
you
back
from
being
the
best
version
of
your
truest
self
but
those
beliefs
go
knowing
they
do
not
serve
the
true
you
in
any
way
it
may
not
be
our
beliefs
but
a
troubling
thought
may
linger
after
hours
of
the
event
in
this
census
like
a
game
of
tennis
there
are
times
when
you
may
lose
a
point
but
there
are
other
times
where
you
'll
gain
one
the
only
thing
to
remember
is
to
keep
playing
and
to
keep
playing
it
's
simply
a
matter
of
breathing
therefore
just
breathe
in
and
breathe
out
again
there
is
no
saying
what
the
future
holds
for
us
to
dwell
on
the
uncertainty
only
brings
more
stress
more
anxiety
through
gratitude
and
appreciation
of
all
the
gifts
life
has
offered
you
today
be
certain
that
tomorrow
will
be
better
reassert
this
on
your
next
breath
bring
in
all
the
wonders
of
your
present
life
everything
that
you
are
grateful
for
only
think
of
one
or
two
things
and
they
can
be
as
simple
as
having
a
roof
over
your
head
or
having
your
next
meal
all
this
breath
just
for
a
moment
as
you
breathe
out
release
all
expectations
of
tomorrow
let
go
of
all
control
surrender
and
that
weight
of
expectation
will
be
automatically
lifted
here
and
now
you
are
wholly
present
neither
your
past
your
future
your
troubles
nor
your
beliefs
can
take
this
moment
away
from
you
this
is
the
gift
known
as
the
present
one
that
comes
for
all
of
us
to
embrace
stay
here
for
a
moment
in
and
out
existing
completely
in
this
present
moment
let
go
of
everything
that
is
beyond
your
control
you
've
done
your
part
to
the
best
of
your
abilities
the
rest
now
will
be
taken
care
of
trust
in
life
now
you
deserve
the
best
and
with
the
following
affirmations
you
may
surrender
completely
you
can
mentally
repeat
these
to
yourself
I
accept
all
the
gifts
that
the
universe
has
to
offer
me
I
am
grateful
for
mirakl
I
find
around
every
corner
I
appreciate
my
life
by
living
it
to
the
fullest
I
love
the
way
I
am
and
believe
in
my
abilities
I
am
totally
free
I
choose
to
do
things
that
make
me
happy
I
fully
deserve
to
be
happy
I
am
loved
and
loved
fully
I
am

my
friendhello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
deep
relaxation
sleep
meditation
the
following
meditation
is
designed
to
help
you
relax
deeply
and
sleep
well
it
's
called
the
61
points
of
yoga
nidra
Yoga
Nidra
means
yoga
sleep
and
is
an
effective
way
of
helping
even
the
most
die-hard
insomniac
get
their
40
winks
for
the
night
Yoga
Nidra
will
take
you
into
that
intermediate
state
between
waking
and
sleep
so
you
could
also
perform
it
while
sitting
upright
on
your
meditation
mat
or
chair
today
's
meditation
however
is
designed
for
those
of
you
who
want
to
nod
off
so
it
's
best
done
lying
on
your
back
not
your
side
or
on
your
stomach
as
doing
so
can
affect
your
breathing
so
keep
your
spine
straight
and
make
sure
that
your
head
faces
straight
up
not
turn
to
one
side
lay
your
arms
at
a
comfortable
distance
away
from
your
body
with
your
palms
facing
up
and
just
spread
your
legs
enough
apart
so
they
do
n't
touch
each
other
both
your
arms
and
legs
should
be
kept
straight
not
bent
or
elevated
now
closing
your
lips
and
relax
your
jaw
so
there
's
a
gap
between
your
teeth
and
gently
rest
the
tip
of
your
tongue
against
the
back
of
your
upper
teeth
and
you
can
close
your
eyes
go
ahead
and
figured
as
much
as
you
need
in
order
to
get
comfortable
so
in
a
few
more
moments
I
'm
going
to
ask
you
to
synchronize
your
breathing
to
what
I
say
the
idea
of
this
is
to
begin
to
slow
down
your
breathing
so
inhale
for
two
seconds
exhale
inhale
again
exhale
and
inhale
again
exile
and
now
just
extending
that
breath
a
little
bit
more
now
inhale
for
three
seconds
exhale

inhale
exhale
so

this
meditation
or
say
a
number
followed
by
a
body
part
for
instance
it
'll
be
one
right
index
finger
now
when
you
hear
that
number
I
want
you
to
inhale
and
when
you
hear
the
body
part
I
want
you
to
focus
on
that
body
part
and
as
you
exhale
I
want
you
to
pin
your
focus
on
that
body
part
by
thinking
only
of
that
body
part
and
no
other
and
when
you
hear
the
next
number
followed
by
the
next
body
part
inhale
shift
your
focus
to
that

area

it
's
time
to
let
go
we
seem
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
our
minds
thinking
about
past
events
worrying
about
the
future
and
oftentimes
these
intensify
just
as
we
rest
our
heads
on
our
pillow
to
go
to
sleep
let

now
release
this
if

worrying

for

yourself
now
entering
into
the
deep
dense
Amazon
rainforest
over
two
million
miles
of
lush
greenery
rainforest
that
is
filled
with
hundreds
of
billions
of
individual
trees
although
somewhat
dark
up
ahead
you
see
the
sun
shining
peering
through
trying
with
all
its
might
to
come
into
full
being
in
this
majestical
place
be
with
the
sounds
of
the
forest
for
a
moment
and
hear
the
abundance
of
insects
birds
and
animals
and
even
the

seem
to
add
their

gentle
vibrations
to
this
enormous
space

as
you
breathe
the

breathes
with
you
if

your

wanders
and
you
become
aware

this
just
gently
shift
it
back

sensing
and
moving
closer
towards
the
Sun
that
continues
to
try
to
break
through
the

canopy
a
gentle
light
rain
begins
to
fall
down
you
find
a
comfortable
place
to
be
and
allow
the
raindrops
to
comfort
you
feel
this
rain
fall
on
your
skin
it
relieves
you
from
the
humidity
refreshing
you
and
seems
to
wash
away
your
past
setting
you
free
if
only
for
the
next
few
moments
from
all
past
worries
and
concerns
this
is
your
time
right

repetitive
thoughts
continue
within

acknowledge
them
and

them
know
that
you
will
deal
with
them
later
right
now

the
rain
eases
and
you
begin
to
move
on
not
too
far
up
ahead
you
see
before
you
a
stupendous
sized
broadleaf
tree
it
seems
to
stand
out
from
all
the
others
it
has
enormous
vines
twisting
and
turning
winding
its
way
up
the
mammoth
girth
of
this
powerful
specimen
of
a
tree
you
are
drawn
to
it
as
if
by
some
sort
of
magnetic
force
it
's
calling
you
almost
like
it
has
something
important
to
share
with
you
you
move
closer

're
standing
there
before

much
of
the
Amazonian
plant

surrounding
you
this
enormous
tree
senses
your
trials
and
tribulations
of
late
it
even
knows
of
deep
pain
that
you
may
not
even
be
consciously
aware
of
at
this
point
in
time
and
so
it
invites
you
to
wrap
your
arms
around
the
base
of
the
tree
and
so
you
do
feel
its
strength
feel
how
powerful
this
living
being
is
and
it
is
a
being
it
's
alive

and
epitomizes
strength

the
earthly
scent
of
the
trunk
as
your
face
presses
up
against
it
smell
the
leaves
surrounding
it
in
the
damp
ground
as
you
continue
to
connect
on
a
deeper
level
with
this
tree
you
feel
a
powerful
surge
run
through
you
enveloping
you
comforting
you
healing
you

routine
clear
the
clutter
of
your
mind
slow
down
the
momentum
of
your
day
and
sleep
peacefully
the
practice
of
meditation
is
about
returning
your
attention
to
the
present
moment
with
acceptance
and
kindness
for
what
you
find
it
is
about
coming
back
to
the

yourself
going
down
the
rabbit
hole
of
worrying

will
become

comfortable
take
a
moment
and
make
sure
your
environment
is
all
set
for
you
to
drift
off
into
sleep

is
important
for
you
to
have
the
sense
of
safety

you
can
fully
relax
make
sure
the

dark
all

will
start
this
meditation
with
your
eyes
open
gently

your
room
is
probably
dark
focus
your
gaze
softly
on
one
point
a
spot
on
the
floor

the
wall

just
a
sense
of
color
in
the
darkness

narrow
your
focus
to
this
one
single
point
and
allow
everything
in
the

to
blur

fade
away
let
your
focus
rest
on
this
one
point
stay
with
this
narrow
focus
for
a
moment
then
as
if
this
one
point
could
get
even
smaller

to
draw
your
focus
in
until
your

gradually
closed
and
you
allow
your
attention
to
turn
inward
[

your
thoughts
to
do
the

narrowing
inward

the
momentum

the
day
gradually
slow

patient
with
this
process
of
slowing
down
[

when
your
eyes
fully
closed

your
attention
turns
inward
bring
your
awareness
to
your
breath

to
count
the
length
of
your
natural
breath
in

out

carry
away
with
it
any
physical
and
emotional
stress

tension

exhaling

breath

slow

calm
down

counting

like
and

the
full
exhale

down

move
on

up

all

down

up

feel
that
your

now
that
you
are
calm
and
deeply
relaxed
imagine
a
scene
in
nature
with
a
waterfall
this
can
be
a
place
you
have
been
before
we
're
an
image
from
a
photograph

or
purely
imaginary
whatever
comes
to

is
fine
[

in
your
mind
see
this
waterfall

how
quickly
the
water
moves
over
the
edge
flowing
freely

the
rush
of
water
going
over
the
edge
and
splashing
down

the
momentum
of
the
moving
water
[

below
the
waterfall
the
water
is
flowing
into
a
river
the
water
here
moving
a
little
slower
yet
there
is
still
much
momentum
carrying
the
water
away
this
river
moves
the
water
into
a
lake
where
the
water
is
much
calmer
and
eventually
comes
to
stillness
[
Music

on
the
far
side
of
the
lake
you
can
see
the
still
water
appearing
with
a
glass-like
surface
reflecting
the
surrounding
scene
[

like
the
movement
of
the
waterfall
flowing
into
the
river
and
into
the
calm
lake
your
energy
and
your
thoughts
can
slow
down
and
just
illness
invite
the
slowing
of
the
momentum
of
your
energy
from
the
day
past
the
slowing
of
your
thoughts
in
your
mind
[

imagine
your
thoughts
are
like
a
leaf
floating
in
the
water
being
moved
from
waterfall
to

to
stillness
in
the
calm
lake

back
from

will
be
there
when

need
them
in
the
calm
state
of

of
your
worries
so
that
you
can

what
you

they
acknowledge
your

with
acceptance
without
the
need
to
follow
them
off
into
story

meet
your
present
experience
with
permission
[

allow
your
thoughts
to
come
and

without

outline
of
a
door

its
texture
perhaps
not
at
dark
oak
or
a
sleek
blond
wood
notice
how
it
is
becoming
more
real
more
concrete
[

standing
up
from

or
reclining
position
and
walking
towards
that
door
reach
out
your
hand
and
touch
it
feeling

's
cool
solidity
now
grasp
its
handle
and
give
it
a
gentle
tug
opening
it
to
reveal
a
staircase
leading
upwards
you
can
not
see
what
's
at
the
top
of
these
stairs
but
you
know
deep
inside
that
it
will
be
something
calming
and
pleasant
[

take
that
first
step
up
the
stair
feel
your
feet
against
the
stairs
treads
worn
from

many
years
of
use

take

as
you
begin
to
get
closer

top
of
the
staircase
visualize
the
warm
sunny
light
emanating
from
the
room
beyond

relaxing
more
fully
take
two
more
steps
and
you
've
reached
the
landing
you
're
in
a
library
of
sorts
with
tall
ceilings
and
enormous
glass
windows
outside
of
the
glass
you
can
see
fluffy
white
clouds
moving
across
a
cerulean
sky
watch
them
pass
for
a
moment
slow
and
graceful
wisps
against
a
calm
blue
background

glow
of
the
sunlight

your
eyelids

a
soft
upholstered
chair
with
a
small
table
next
to
it
walk
towards
it
noticing
all
the
bookshelves
you
pass
and
the
colorful
intricately
embossed
spines
of
the
books
that
reside
there
know
that
they
do
n't
matter
right
now
as
the
book
you
need
to
read
is
already
waiting
for
you
resting
on
that
little
side
table
just
ahead
when
you
reach
it
sink
into
the
chair
feel
its
softness
how
it
supports
your
back
your
neck
your
shoulders
right
where
they
may
be
aching

all
this
pain
and
tension
and
inhale

in
total
calm

how
easy
it
is
to
just
dissolve
into
this
chair
releasing
any
thoughts
that
you
've
been
carrying
with
you
until

on
the
front
in
gold
leaf
just
above
a
delicately
embossed
pattern
of
stars
look
a
little
more
closely
at
this
title
sensing
these
golden
letters
rearranging
themselves
until
you
can
read
what
they
say
this
book
is
called
relaxation
run
your
fingers
across
the
cover
feeling
the
pebbly
texture
of
the
leather
and
the
slight
indentations
of
the
embossed
pattern
know
that
when
you
open
it
you
will
be
taken
someplace
new
someplace
totally
calm
that

the
book
and

the
printed
words

texture
of
the
paper
and
the
text
getting
larger
and
larger
surrounding
your
body
like
a
warm
gentle
bath
watch
the
characters
dissolve
slowly
but
surely
until

a
grassy

of

know
that
you
can
return
to
this
hill
to
this
very
spot
anytime
you
wish
as
you
observe
the
valley
below
you
bring
your
attention
to
your
feet
planted
on
the
ground
underneath
them
there
is
a
pebbly
path
just
in
front
of
you
made
from
small
white
river
stones
it
leads
down
into
the
valley
and
fades
into
the
distance
somewhere
beyond
the
city
you
know
that
this
path
will
take
you
exactly
where
you
need
to
go
and
so
as
you
begin
to
walk
down
it
you
feel
any
tension
melting
away
left
behind
on
the
hilltop
feel
the
way
your
feet
press
against
the
cool
smooth
stones
the
way
the
pebbles
give
way
like
sand
notice
the
city
lights
getting
closer
as
with
each
step
you
take
tension
dissolves
and
you
relax
more
completely
keep
walking
enjoying

you
to

now
that
you
're
close
to
the
city
you
see
that
the
Whitestone
path
continues
through
it
leading
you
through
brightly
lit
streets
and
dimmer
alleyways
it
flows
over
any
obstacles
that
may
be
in
your
way
keeping
you
totally
safe
and
guiding
you
towards
your
ultimate
destination
as
you
pass
houses
and
storefronts
smile
at
the
sounds
of
conversation
and
laughter
inside
their
walls
but
do
not
worry
about
speaking
to
any
of
the
inhabitants
you
may
return
another
time
and
explore
the
nooks
and
crannies
of
this
city
but
now
you
are
drawn
almost
magnetically
to
what
awaits
you
at
the
end
of
this
path
if
you
encounter
figures
or
thoughts
from
your
day
know
that
they
accept
this
and
will
happily
await
your
return
another
day
the
white
stone
path
continues
onwards
through
the
city
every
step
pulls
you
closer
and
closer
to
its
end
where

breathe
deeply
inhaling
the
soft
night
air
and
gentle
lights
of
this
quiet
city
you
are
now
leaving
the
city
continuing
out
into
the
countryside
beyond
the
lights
notice
how
much
easier
it
is
to
see
the
stars
out
here
feel
the
way
the
soft
grasses
brush
against
your
legs
as
you
continue
on
this
pebbly
path
breathing
deeply
and
releasing
any
cares
you
may
be
still
carrying
you
can
see
an
outline
of
something
a
little
further
ahead
something
at
the
end
of
this
path
as
you
approach
it
you
see
that
it
is
an
old
well
and
on
it
hang
as
a
small
lamp
flickering
slightly
in
the
gentle
night
breeze
approach
it
feeling
the
way
the
path
pushes
you
towards
it
when

reach
this
well

a
moment
and

the
sturdy
time-worn
stone
although
it
has
been
here
for
many
years
everything
is
still
in
good
repair
when
you
are
ready
grasp
the
wells
handle
and
turn
it
lowering
the
metal
pail
that
hangs
on
it
down
into
the
ground
there
are
a
few
small
bells
tied
to
the
rope
notice
how
they
tinkle
merrily
as
the
pail
descends
happy
to
help
you
along
your
journey
take
a
moment
to
enjoy
the
sounds
of
the
sleeping
valley
around
you
[

continue
turning
the
handle
until
you
hear
the
pails
splash
as
if
it
's
water
once
it
does
exhale
releasing
your
expectations
along
with
your
breath
inhale
turning
the
crank
the
opposite
way
to
bring
the
bucket
back
up
to
you
when
the
bucket
reaches
the
top
of
the
well
there
will
be
something
inside
it
for
you
something
to
help
you
remember
this
feeling
of
total
calm
so
when
you
are
ready

in
and

tension
or
anxiety

body

this
gift
from
the
valley
into

no

hello
and
welcome
to
this
guided
sleep
meditation

help
you
to
visualize
yourself
achieving
the
weight
loss
or
physique
that
is
of
your
highest
intent
my
name
is
jason
stevenson
and
i
invite
you
to
open
your
mind
and
this
meditation
will
help
to
inspire
you
to
achieve
the
physical
body
that
feels
perfect
for
you
and
to
help
you
sleep
well
to
begin
this
meditation
just
bring
yourself
to
a
comfortable
resting
position
and
ensure
that
all
end-of-day
activities
are
taken
care
of
and
that
you
are
fully
supported
by
whatever
pillows
or
blankets
you
might
need
close
your
eyes
if
you
've
not
already
done
so
and
just
take
a
few
moments
to
ground
yourself
through
the
natural
rhythm
of
your
breathing
you
do
n't
need
to
change
the
breath
in
any
way
yet
for
now
simply
let
it
flow
in
and
out
as
it
yearns
to
be
in
this
moment
considering
it
to
be
an
anchor
for
your
awareness
notice
what
parts
of
your
body
rise
and
fall
as
you
breathe
as
well
as
any
other
physical
sensations
that
you
observe
[
Music
]
now
softening
the
belly
and
seeing
if
your
breath
might
naturally
deepen
as
you
shift
your
awareness
further
down
into
your
body
[
Music
]
and
i
invite
you
to
imagine
each
breath
extending
beyond
both
lungs
and
belly
to
awaken
each
and
every
cell
of
your
being
let
each
and
every
inhalation
breathe
itself
into
your
whole
body
with
each
of
these
full
body
breaths
imagine
that
every
in-breath
brings
vitality
and
aliveness
to
your
cells
and
that
each
breath
out
frees
you
of
stagnation
or
lethargy
so
feeling
into
the
stillness
yet
radiant
vitality
of
your
body
in
this
moment
and
now
before
we
move
into
a
visualization
to
help
us
manifest
our
greatest
aspirations
for
the
physical
body
let
's
take
some
time
now
to
hone
our
attention
on
specific
energy
centers
within
your
body
as
we
draw
our
attention
through
the
body
we
will
awaken
the
major
energy
points
within
it
that
help
us
to
achieve
this
new
physical
reality
so
begin
now
by
drawing
your
attention
to
the
base
of
your
spine
to
the
root
of
your
being
with
your
awareness
held
here
at
the
root
chakra
let
each
breath
in
fill
this
part
of
you
with
a
renewed
sense
of
connectedness
to
the
physical
world
to
the
earth
beneath
you
and
to
your
very
own
body
you
are
grounded
connected
and
full
of
vitality
now
let
your
awareness
shift
slowly
to
the
navel
as
you
hold
your
attention
on
your
core
let
each
breath
in
create
an
expansion
here
filling
you
with
confidence
will
power
and
determination
to
achieve
your
dreams
you
are
strong
resilient
and
empowered
let
your
inward
gaze
now
move
away
from
the
core
as
it
lands
in
the
heart
space
in
the
center
of
your
chest
and
as
you
hold
your
attention
here
on
the
heart
let
each
breath
awaken
your
sense
of
self-love
and
unconditional
worthiness
you
are
loved
worthy
and
wonderful
and
slowly
now
shift
your
awareness
to
your
third
eye
to
the
center
of
your
forehead
and
just
slightly
higher
than
your
brow
line
and
as
you
hold
your
awareness
here
let
each
inhalation
awaken
your
capacity
for
inspired
imagination
as
well
as
your
ability
to
intuit
what
your
body
requires
in
any
moment
you
see
and
believe
in
your
highest
potential
you
know
what
your
body
needs
and
now
allow
your
attention
to
land
on
the
crown
of
your
head
the
top
of
your
head
let
each
inhalation
rise
to
fill
this
part
of
your
being
and
as
it
does
allow
it
to
fill
you
with
a
deep
connection
to
the
limitless
energy
of
this
world
whatever
you
require
to
achieve
the
physical
state
you
long
for
the
universe
can
provide
it
you
are
connected
supported
and
ready
for
transformation
now
let
your
focus
open
up
as
you
come
back
to
full
awareness
of
your
body
now
in
your
mind
's
eye
i
invite
you
to
envision
that
you
are
standing
on
a
warm
and
sandy
beach
gazing
across
azure
blue
waters
and
behind
you
staggering
amber
cliffs
rise
up
towards
the
sky
the
contrast
between
the
bright
blue
waters
and
this
rich
orange
earth
is
mesmerizing
you
revel
in
the
beauty
and
wonder
of
this
space
and
as
you
turn
back
towards
the
sea
you
take
a
few
moments
to
ground
yourself
into
the
place
that
you
occupy
through
the
soles
of
your
feet
you
ground
yourself
into
the
soft
sand
and
earth
that
supports
you
that
provides
you
with
vital
earthly
energy
[
Music
]
and
through
the
crown
of
your
head
you
connect
with
the
limitless
potential
of
the
universe
your
mind
is
beginning
to
expand
to
let
all
possibilities
filter
into
your
awareness
[
Music
]
the
upward
moving
energy
from
the
earth
meets
with
the
downward
moving
energy
from
the
cosmos
landing
in
the
center
of
your
heart
and
grounding
you
in
love
these
energies
meet
in
the
heart
to
ensure
that
all
actions
you
take
are
rooted
in
and
reflective
of
self-care
self-kindness
and
self-love
so
take
a
few
long
deep
breaths
as
you
harness
the
energy
above
below
and
all
around
you
and
after
your
last
long
exhale
let
the
breath
come
back
to
its
natural
rhythm
as
you
envision
yourself
moving
down
the
coastline
how
you
move
down
this
beach
is
entirely
up
to
you
perhaps
you
walk
with
grace
run
with
strength
dance
with
full
expression
or
move
in
some
other
way
that
your
body
feels
called
to
move
in
whatever
mode
of
movement
helps
you
to
feel
strong
and
stable
in
your
body
envision
yourself
flowing
effortlessly
along
the
sandy
beach
before
you
you
are
deeply
attuned
to
the
needs
and
wishes
of
your
body
in
this
moment
note
what
it
feels
like
to
move
in
this
way
take
this
time
to
observe
what
feelings
and
sensations
arise
how
does
your
body
look
as
you
move
how
does
it
feel
to
move
with
strength
confidence
and
agility
spend
just
a
few
more
moments
allowing
yourself
to
move
in
a
way
that
inspires
you
until
soon
the
beach
begins
to
narrow
as
it
reaches
its
northernmost
end
[
Music
]
from
where
you
stand
at
the
tip
of
this
beach
you
realize
you
have
two
options
to
go
back
to
the
place
you
started
at
or
to
venture
onwards
and
up
you
choose
the
latter
and
so
you
decide
to
climb
the
rock
face
that
leads
gradually
up
towards
the
peak
of
these
majestic
cliffs
you
follow
a
small
foot
trail
that
takes
you
a
few
meters
up
from
the
beach
and
that
is
where
the
work
begins
step
by
step
you
make
your
way
up
the
mountainous
terrain
with
confidence
and
strength
your
body
is
fully
engaged
and
your
mind
is
radiant
and
alive
with
each
step
you
take
you
shed
any
and
all
limiting
beliefs
that
hold
you
back
from
achieving
your
fullest
potential
your
body
too
sheds
any
excess
weight
that
no
longer
serves
you
or
it
builds
the
muscle
the
natural
strength
that
you
have
long
been
yearning
to
cultivate
perhaps
it
does
both
you
feel
and
empowered
to
achieve
the
perfect
body
for
yourself
you
are
beginning
right
here
right
now
notice
how
it
feels
to
exert
yourself
in
this
way
to
absorb
the
energy
of
the
earth
the
sky
and
the
sun
and
to
propel
yourself
forward
with
vitality
you
are
fully
alive
relish
in
what
this
feels
like
soon
the
incline
decreases
in
intensity
as
you
approach
the
highest
plateau
of
the
cliff
face
as
your
movements
slow
and
require
less
of
your
energy
you
come
back
to
the
rhythm
of
your
breath
breathing
slowly
and
deeply
you
take
your
last
few
steps
towards
the
highest
lookout
point
of
this
mountainous
terrain
from
where
you
stand
you
can
see
the
shoreline
extending
for
miles
and
miles
and
the
sea
drifting
into
the
horizon
the
water
azure
blue
by
the
shore
slowly
fades
into
a
deep
and
mysterious
darkness
you
are
in
awe
with
the
beauty
of
this
landscape
as
you
gaze
out
across
the
ocean
you
realize
that
anything
is
possible
you
see
this
infinite
world
of
possibility
reflected
in
your
own
mind
and
spirit
confident
in
your
ability
to
achieve
whatever
it
is
you
long
for
and
with
your
feet
grounded
in
the
rich
earth
beneath
you
you
stand
tall
and
strong
fully
grounded
in
this
body
that
carries
you
through
life
a
deep
sense
of
gratitude
for
your
physical
body
moves
through
you
and
so
you
thank
it
for
its
wisdom
support
and
resilience
you
take
just
a
few
more
moments
to
gaze
out
across
the
vast
sea
below
you
and
as
you
turn
around
to
find
a
comfortable
place
to
rest
your
body
you
were
surprised
to
find
a
mirror
has
appeared
from
seemingly
nowhere
it
stands
on
the
pathway
that
leads
down
to
the
grassy
valley
below
slowly
you
make
your
way
towards
the
mirror
mindful
step
by
step
and
as
you
reach
it
your
eyes
widen
at
the
reflection
you
see
in
the
mirror
it
is
your
perfect
self
a
glimmering
you
embodying
a
physical
body
that
makes
you
feel
alive
confident
and
radiant
take
a
moment
to
scan
yourself
in
the
mirror
admiring
the
perfection
of
your
physical
form
and
notice
the
way
you
glisten
and
then
deepen
your
gaze
as
you
focus
in
on
what
radiates
out
from
within
your
confidence
your
happiness
your
vitality
and
aliveness
you
are
supremely
beautiful
both
inside
and
out
just
take
a
few
more
moments
to
revel
in
this
radiant
image
of
yourself
knowing
that
this
self
will
move
with
you
even
when
the
mirror
is
gone
you
feel
confident
to
step
away
from
it
for
now
and
as
you
pass
it
by
taking
the
pathway
that
leads
down
to
the
lush
green
valley
below
feel
a
deep
sense
of
self-appreciation
warmth
and
tenderness
rise
up
within
you
you
sense
that
your
mind
spirit
and
body
are
in
full
alignment
now
and
so
you
are
ready
to
rest
deeply
for
a
while
[
Music
]
your
feet
carry
you
to
a
bright
valley
and
there
you
find
a
picnic
blanket
and
a
place
to
rest
your
head
for
a
while
you
lower
yourself
down
to
the
earth
resting
flat
on
your
back
as
you
gaze
up
at
the
blue
sky
and
scattered
white
clouds
thinners
cotton
above
you
the
sun
has
disappeared
from
your
view
slowly
departing
for
the
day
to
grace
another
place
on
this
earth
hours
pass
by
and
soon
the
sky
transforms
to
orange
and
purple
and
then
to
a
deep
midnight
blue
the
full
moon
rises
and
the
stars
too
and
as
you
gaze
up
at
these
planetary
neighbors
you
feel
called
to
set
an
intention
to
commit
yourself
to
nourishing
and
supporting
your
physical
body
and
all
the
ways
it
yearns
to
be
cherished
take
a
moment
now
to
set
this
intention
for
your
physical
appearance
and
well-being
in
your
words
in
your
mind
repeating
it
to
the
cosmos
three
times
in
silence
the
stars
continue
to
glisten
reflecting
the
beauty
and
radiance
that
is
very
much
alive
within
you
and
soon
your
eyes
grow
tired
your
body
heavy
you
scan
your
body
from
head
to
toe
letting
each
body
part
you
pass
surrender
into
the
supportive
earth
and
as
you
close
your
eyes
to
the
night
the
visualization
of
this
natural
landscape
dissipates
you
come
back
to
the
place
that
holds
you
by
feeling
into
the
supportive
surface
beneath
you
just
let
your
entire
body
relax
slowly
surrendering
completely
into
sleep
you
may
use
your
breath
as
an
anchor
once
again
to
keep
you
grounded
and
present
and
simultaneously
i
invite
you
to
allow
the
following
affirmations
to
fill
your
consciousness
and
as
they
do
they
will
continue
to
inspire
your
physical
transformation
empowering
you
through
positive
beliefs
so
let
go
of
all
effort
now
as
you
allow
your
subconscious
mind
to
take
these
affirmations
in

in
three
deep
breaths
in
through
the

blowing
all
the
excess
air
out
and

the
expansion
and
contraction
of
your

simply

's
a
practice
of
meditation
it
happens
we
are
thinking
beings
and
all
you
need

the
thoughts
away

focus
back
to

my
voice

your

back
into
the
present
moment

okay
for
this
to
happen
we
are
thinking
beings
and
so
we
think
thousands
of
thoughts
a
day
what
I
ask
you
to
do
is
simply
observe
the
thoughts
without
attaching
to
it
and
in
their
own
time
allow
them
to
melt
away

right

stresses
can

you
hold
tension

it
all
go
focusing
on
your
feet
move
them
a
little

tense
them
hold
that
tension
and
now
let
them
go

your
lips
be
open
slightly
we
often
carry
tension
across
the
scalp
and
forward
to
just
breathe
in
and
exhale
and
visualize
the
muscles
relaxing
at
will
and
again
breathing
in
and
on
the
breath
out
see
your
facial
muscles
just
relax
systematically

enables
you
to
eradicate
tension

a
routine

thoughts
for
the
day
when
these
thoughts
come
up

always
keep
coming
back
to
my
talking
or
your
own
breathing
if
you
struggle
to
stop
the
bombardment
of
thoughts
infiltrating
your
mind
or
find
that
you
constantly
try
to
solve
problems
the
moment
you

wonders

filling
all
the
way
up
from

up

have
been
carved
into

many
years
before

hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
guided
sleep
meditation
this
is
a
meditation
that
is
not
only
good
to
help
you
sleep
you
may
also
find
it
a
tool
to
help
with
lucid
dreaming
as
this
is
another
way
of
entering
that
incredible
state
between
wakefulness
and
sleep
our
minds
and
bodies
are
like
children
and
the
more
we
ignore
their
demands
the
more
they
demand
our
attention
so
if
sleep
eludes
you
then
you
could
be
possibly
ignoring
some
demand
from
your
body
and
your
mind
the
solution
there
for
us
to
pay
attention
to
them
but
on
your
own
terms
not
theirs
and
that
can
start
with
this
sleep
meditation
it
's
based
upon
yoga
nidra
which
literally
means
yogic
sleep
so
let
's
begin
and
please
lie
on
your
back
and
keep
your
arms
away
from
your
body
with
your
palms
facing
up
allow
your
legs
to
naturally
fall
apart
so
that
they
're
not
touching
each
other
if
you
're
using
a
pillow
make
sure
it
does
n't
elevate
your
head
too
much
so
that
it
restricts
your
breathing
just
a
nice
comfortable
place
so
your
back
is
as
straight
as
possible
but
not
held
rigid
now
I
'd
like
you
to
close
your
eyes
and
pay
attention
to
your
breathing
inhale
exhale
inhale
exhale
your
breathing
should
be
as
relaxed
and
as
natural
as
possible
with
no
significant
pauses
between
each
inhalation
and
exhalation
now
you
do
n't
have
to
make
any
attempts
to
keep
your
breath
even
your
job
is
to
simply
breathe
as
naturally
and
comfortably
as
you
can
and
pay
attention
to
each
in-breath
and
each
out
breath
during
this
meditation
you
may
find
your
mind
wandering
and
that
is
normal
our
minds
do
wander
your
job
is
just
to
simply
gently
bring
your
focus
back
to
your
breathing
or
to
my
voice
let
's
begin
this
beautiful
process
of
a
an
internal
mental
massage
if
you
like
and
to
bring
you
into
that
deep
state
of
yoga
nidra
so
please
take
a
few
more
breaths
and

's
begin

heavier
darkness
of
sleep
and
dreams
if
so
then
good
night
and
may
your
dreams
be
joyful
and
pleasant

you
can
choose
to
remain
here

this
in-between
state

is
only
your
breath
and
your
mind
here
there
is
only
the
heaviness
of
total
surrender

complete
relaxation

body
is
already
asleep

still
receptive
to
any
command

breath
and
your
body
's
response
to
it
as

breathe
in

body
expand
and
rise
with
it
as
you
breathe
out
feel
your
body
contract
and
sink

body
expands
and

you
contract

this
world

puppet

rock

scent
of
leaves
moss
and

papers

trickle
of

sunlight
filters
through

off
the
moving
water

in
this
beautiful
landscape

the
sunlight
meander
back
and
forth
and
trees
sway
in
the
breeze

you
carrying
something
in
your
back
your
neck
your
shoulders

there
any
tension
in

way

you
focus
your
awareness
on
these
places

the
speckles
of
light
move
to
land
on
them

it
with
peacefulness

around
so
that
you
can
look
around
as

float
up

heralding
the

reflected
in
the
rippling
waters
of

the
feeling
here
is
of
complete

invisible

no

here
no
regrets
just
or
at
being
able
to
see
life
from
a
whole
new
perspective
traveling
over
the
estuary
you
head
along
the
coastline
scaling
large
cliffs
flying
high
above
them
thin
wispy
clouds
almost
transparent
from
below
are
blown
in
from
the
sea
hugging
the
cliffs
as
you
move
higher
the
clouds
wrap
themselves
around
you
like
gossamer
threads
the
clouds
wispy
fragile
and
translucent
follow
in
your
trail
as
you
saw
ever
higher
rising
vertically
now
higher
and
higher
looking
up
towards
the
moon
silvery
gray
the
moon
is
for
you

at
its
beauty

power
knowing
how
it
controls
the
ebb
and
wane
of
the
tides

is
suddenly

seems
less
complicated
there
is
a
sense
of
pureness
of
mystery
and
yet
clarity
life
is
good
life
is
wonderful
and
you
share
a
sense
of
connection
with
the
universe
breathing
deeply
and
then
release
the
breath
letting
go
of
any
tension
within
your
body
instead
focus
on
the
softness
of
every
muscle
feel
yourself
loose
relaxed
and
free
from
burden
far
below
you
low
flying
birds
hug
the
surface
of
the
water
disturbed
they
seem
tiny
and
fast
moving
the
water
ripples
gently
sparkling
stars
and
the
light
from
the
moon
Herald
your
way
you
see
the
world
from
an
enlightened
viewpoint
and
it
is
one
of
wonder
here
high
above
the
fragmented
clouds
you
feel
a
part
of
the
world
's
mystery
connected
on
every
level
and
free
from
your
problems
you
can
sense
a
change
around
you
gradually
the
air
becomes
warmer
and
misted
as
cloud
formations
begin
to
forge
together
the
sky
changes
color
dark
muted
through
to
light
and
for
a
while
the
Sun
and
Moon
share
a
place
in
the
heavens
he
dropped
down
now
through
the
fluffy
clouds
thicker
now
and
float
down
towards
the
Earth
's
surface
you
feel
exalted
as
the
see
now
mirrors
the
changing
skies
sparkling
sunlight
glinting
across
the
surface
and
shimmers
of
blue
you
drift
down
moving
on
away
from
the
water
's
edges
still
high
above
the
city
's
architecture
tall
concrete
pillars
and
homes
reaching
up
towards
the
sky
and
small
private
residences
alone
surrounded
by
small
patches
of
green
like
a
complex
jigsaw
of
life
stone
and
irregular
shapes
all
fitting
together
in
an
almost
seamless
ease
marvel
at
how
the
man-made
structures
can
look
beautiful
too
here
you
can
see
that
life
is
about
living
and
not
holding
on
to
problems
there
is
no
place
in
your
life
anymore
for
anxieties
that
make
you
feel
ill
tension
headaches
regrets
that
nor
away
that
cue
or
the
decisions
that
you
just
ca
n't
make
here
in
this
weightless
existence
you
realize
that
you
can
be
free
from
all
of
the
negative
aspects
of
life
no
longer
shackled
by
an
existence
that
holds
you
back
this
acknowledgement
is
meaningful
it
has
the
power
to
change
your
life
as
you
breathing
deeply
conjure
up
the
image
of
those
problems
and
all
of
the
boxes
that
you
left
behind
initially
they
were
overflowing
threatening
in
their
power
to
hamper
your
life
to
impact
you
at
every
turn
now
picture
them
reduced
in
size
no
more
threatening
just
minor
inconveniences
now
that
you
have
scaled
them
in
your
mind
shrink
the
problems
smaller
still
breathe
deeply
again
and
then
out
breathing
out
the
last
of
your
connections
to
those
problems
and
visualize
them
growing
ever
smaller
minut
a
fraction
of
their
former
size
and
you
realize
that
your
perspective
was
clouded
before
your
judgement
of
center
your
realization
of
the
truth
in
life
and
the
importance
of
nature
and
your
place
in
the
world
makes
those
problems
seem
insignificant
by
comparison

life
as
mere
obstacles

the
power
to

youmy
name
is
jason
stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
that
will
help
you
to
wisely
let
go
of
any
anger
you
might
be
experiencing
before
sleep
when
held
onto
anger
can
inhibit
us
from
feeling
into
our
innate
sense
of
peace
and
our
capacity
for
compassion
and
so
by
becoming
mindful
of
this
emotion
and
addressing
it
thoughtfully
we
can
loosen
its
grip
and
uncover
a
new
way
forward
so
to
begin
this
bedtime
meditation
take
your
time
to
get
settled
in
for
the
night
ensure
that
your
spine
is
long
and
straight
and
your
neck
becoming
an
extension
of
it
and
then
allow
your
limbs
to
relax
and
fall
however
they
are
comfortable
close
your
eyes
as
you
turn
your
attention
inwards
and
then
note
what
it
feels
like
to
be
held
by
the
surface
beneath
you
what
does
it
feel
like
to
be
tethered
by
the
weight
of
gravity
what
does
the
mattress
or
other
surface
beneath
you
feel
like
against
your
skin
without
judging
your
experience
see
if
you
can
simply
become
more
intimate
with
the
physical
space
you
rest
in
and
once
you
feel
grounded
and
completely
connected
to
the
physical
world
i
invite
you
to
shift
your
attention
to
the
air
around
you
you
might
notice
the
sensation
of
it
against
your
cheeks
or
you
might
observe
the
way
it
slowly
enters
and
exits
the
body
as
your
breath
as
each
breath
fills
you
you
're
provided
with
life-supporting
oxygen
offered
to
us
by
the
plant
kingdom
and
with
each
breath
out
we
return
this
gift
to
the
plant
life
in
the
form
of
carbon
dioxide
spend
a
few
moments
with
your
breath
now
noting
how
effortless
this
exchange
this
flow
is
see
if
you
can
allow
the
chest
the
shoulders
and
the
belly
to
soften
facilitating
the
flow
of
the
breath
and
perhaps
inviting
it
a
little
bit
deeper
now
as
we
dive
into
this
process
of
releasing
the
energy
of
anger
it
is
worthwhile
to
begin
by
softening
out
judgments
of
this
emotion
in
and
of
itself
anger
is
neither
good
nor
bad
it
is
simply
a
reaction
we
experience
to
various
circumstances
or
events
in
our
life
what
we
do
with
our
anger
is
another
thing
when
left
to
fest
inside
or
when
released
mindlessly
upon
those
around
us
anger
can
hurt
more
than
it
heals
however
we
can
also
choose
to
use
anger
as
a
signpost
for
what
we
value
for
the
direction
we
wish
to
move
in
our
lives
only
when
we
begin
by
softening
our
judgment
and
opening
to
this
experience
with
more
care
and
curiosity
do
we
enable
ourselves
to
discover
a
new
way
forward
so
right
now
i
invite
you
to
take
a
moment
to
draw
your
attention
to
your
heart
space
the
center
of
your
chest
and
as
you
breathe
envision
the
heart
expanding
energetically
with
each
breath
in
and
softening
its
toughest
barriers
with
each
breath
out
with
each
breath
that
moves
through
the
heart
imagine
your
judgments
of
this
emotion
relaxing
as
you
create
more
space
for
it
to
unravel
in
a
healing
and
a
cleansing
way
if
stories
about
rightness
or
wrongness
come
to
mind
simply
note
these
as
they
appear
and
then
release
with
an
out
breath
for
example
if
we
notice
ourselves
feeling
righteous
or
holding
on
to
the
wrong
doings
of
another
we
might
invite
these
to
soften
if
only
just
for
a
moment
and
this
does
not
mean
you
'll
not
be
called
to
take
certain
wise
action
in
daily
life
but
for
now
harboring
the
energy
of
this
anger
is
likely
of
little
benefit
so
continue
to
come
back
to
the
breath
again
and
again
as
needed
expanding
as
you
inhale
and
softening
or
releasing
as
you
exhale
before
we
move
into
the
visualization
that
will
help
us
to
cleanse
any
held
anger
for
the
coming
night
i
invite
you
to
mindfully
inquire
into
the
energy
that
lives
beneath
your
anger
the
energy
that
this
anger
arises
from
sometimes
our
anger
comes
from
the
mind
as
a
yearning
to
be
right
or
as
a
defensive
reaction
other
times
it
arises
from
our
values
from
care
and
concern
about
someone
or
something
and
even
sometimes
it
's
a
mix
of
these
two
things
a
blend
of
mental
and
intuitive
responses
to
the
world
around
us
so
i
invite
you
to
take
a
few
moments
to
compassionately
curiously
and
non-judgmentally
inquire
into
the
energies
beneath
or
behind
the
raw
experience
of
anger
and
just
hold
yourself
gently
as
you
explore
this
noting
to
what
extent
you
might
be
reacting
in
defense
and
to
what
extent
this
emotion
may
be
rising
out
of
love
when
you
awaken
into
another
day
you
can
use
this
self-knowledge
to
help
you
navigate
your
anger
in
a
way
that
is
conducive
of
deep
healing
on
an
individual
and
collective
level
but
for
now
let
's
take
some
time
to
just
let
it
all
go
to
reaffirm
that
in
this
moment
we
are
well
that
in
this
moment
we
can
best
serve
ourselves
by
inviting
our
anger
to
dissolve
so
take
a
moment
now
to
come
back
to
your
breath
for
a
few
cycles
use
the
breath
or
the
body
as
an
anchor
for
your
attention
any
time
you
find
your
mind
wandering
that
does
not
serve
you
in
this
moment
just
bring
it
back
focusing
back
on
your
breathing
and
once
you
feel
centered
i
invite
you
to
bring
your
attention
to
the
creative
capacity
of
your
mind
and
in
this
space
begin
to
visualize
that
you
are
in
the
midst
of
an
autumn
forest
surrounded
by
trees
with
leaves
turning
amber
mahogany
gold
and
crimson
the
forest
floor
beneath
your
feet
is
a
path
of
densely
packed
earth
a
thin
layer
of
early
autumn
leaves
lays
sparse
signifying
that
the
turn
of
seasons
is
upon
you
the
air
is
cool
but
you
are
dressed
warmly
for
the
evening
the
sky
is
still
a
pale
blue
but
you
can
tell
by
the
glimmer
in
the
trees
that
the
sun
will
be
setting
soon
before
making
your
way
along
the
path
that
leads
you
through
the
woods
you
take
a
moment
to
plant
your
feet
into
the
earth
reaching
the
top
of
your
head
towards
the
sky
above
your
heart
opens
your
shoulders
relax
you
take
a
few
long
slow
deep
breaths
to
ground
yourself
into
this
calm
and
soothing
forest
you
allow
your
forehead
to
soften
your
jaw
to
unclench
your
belly
to
relax
and
all
unnecessary
tension
to
soften
and
following
your
next
breath
out
you
decide
to
move
forward
to
venture
deeper
into
the
transitioning
woods
you
have
arrived
in
step
by
step
you
move
along
the
pathway
that
guides
you
through
the
colorful
enchanting
landscape
the
air
is
crisp
and
earthy
cleansing
you
with
each
breath
that
moves
through
you
small
forest
critters
scurry
across
the
earth
and
and
birds
chirp
from
their
cozy
nests
snuggled
in
the
trees
as
you
admire
the
harmony
of
life
here
in
the
woods
you
feel
yourself
surrendering
to
it
opening
up
to
this
moment
exactly
as
it
is
any
weight
you
've
been
carrying
upon
your
shoulders
begins
to
lighten
guided
by
the
energy
of
the
falling
leaves
any
judgments
frustrations
concerns
or
worries
that
you
've
been
harboring
also
find
their
place
in
the
forest
dissolving
from
within
your
body
as
you
harmonize
with
the
environment
around
you
the
woods
are
at
peace
inviting
you
to
find
that
tranquil
space
within
yourself
as
well
though
the
forest
is
not
immune
to
the
challenges
of
life
but
now
it
embraces
the
harmonious
transition
from
day
into
night
you
carry
on
just
a
short
while
before
the
forest
begins
to
thin
and
as
it
does
your
jaw
drops
at
the
radiant
beauty
that
emerges
glimmering
back
into
your
eyes
a
silent
still
pristine
lake
surrounded
by
the
vibrant
foliage
of
the
forest
comes
into
view
treading
lightly
towards
the
water
's
edge
you
find
a
sandy
stretch
of
shoreline
and
allow
yourself
to
take
a
seat
from
where
you
rest
you
admire
the
reflection
of
the
trees
and
the
still
surface
of
the
lake
the
perfect
mirror
image
softens
your
heart
calling
you
deeper
into
the
mystery
of
the
world
the
reflection
reminds
you
that
we
are
all
mirrors
to
one
another
that
everything
we
face
has
something
to
show
us
about
ourselves
or
about
the
nature
of
the
world
see
if
you
can
feel
your
mind
softening
as
you
reflect
upon
this
sinking
into
the
silence
that
holds
it
all
and
now
as
you
sit
here
by
the
lake
you
hold
yourself
and
the
world
in
a
full
embrace
without
desiring
to
change
anything
about
this
simple
moment
see
if
you
can
open
yourself
completely
to
what
is
the
frustrations
the
judgments
anger
that
you
've
experienced
as
being
a
part
of
the
world
now
begin
to
feel
distant
here
amidst
the
autumn
trees
and
silent
lake
you
are
granted
with
the
time
and
space
required
for
you
to
process
all
of
those
inner
energies
you
trust
that
as
you
process
them
new
possibilities
for
more
wise
and
loving
steps
to
take
in
days
to
come
will
present
themselves
to
you
as
you
gaze
out
across
the
water
you
realize
there
is
nothing
that
needs
to
be
done
in
this
moment
but
to
continue
allowing
yourself
to
surrender
and
so
you
lean
back
allowing
your
full
body
to
nestle
into
the
sandy
shore
beneath
you
feel
yourself
fully
supported
here
on
this
small
beach
by
the
lake
as
the
sun
seeps
behind
the
tree
line
the
orange
pink
glow
of
the
night
radiates
throughout
the
cosmos
bringing
a
warmth
to
your
being
and
as
you
rest
here
you
take
a
moment
to
inquire
with
your
body
about
any
areas
of
tension
or
residual
anger
that
may
be
longing
for
your
attention
drawing
your
awareness
to
the
crown
of
your
head
to
begin
you
slowly
scan
the
body
downwards
consciously
relaxing
or
inviting
a
loving
breath
into
each
area
you
pass
when
you
're
finished
tending
to
the
entire
body
come
back
to
your
breath
filling
yourself
with
cleansing
crisp
air
of
the
surrounding
woods
that
hold
you
your
inner
eye
is
still
open
to
the
night
sky
you
watch
as
the
colors
deepen
soon
transitioning
into
a
dark
and
deep
purple
the
crescent
moon
appears
as
do
thousands
upon
thousands
of
shimmering
stars
with
your
entire
body
relaxed
breathe
mindfully
through
the
heart
space
inviting
the
universal
energy
of
love
to
fill
you
on
your
next
breath
in
and
offering
your
inner
love
back
to
the
universe
on
your
next
breath
out
and
as
you
gaze
up
to
the
night
sky
take
a
moment
to
offer
a
few
silent
loving
words
to
yourself
grant
yourself
permission
to
feel
as
you
feel
while
bathing
yourself
in
words
of
love
and
patience
and
care
and
kindness

now
i
invite
you
to
repeat
the
same
for
someone
or
something
that
may
have
stirred
anger
within
you
in
recent
days
and
note
that
this
does
n't
mean
that
you
need
to
make
right
the
actions
of
another
it
is
simply
an
invitation
to
where
possible
send
love
and
care
and
patience
to
that
which
sparks
anger
within
us
when
you
are
finished
come
back
to
your
breath
noting
how
it
causes
your
body
to
rise
and
fall
as
you
rest
in
the
silence
of
this
night
let
all
thoughts
and
all
images
within
the
mind
dissolve
now
there
is
nothing
else
that
needs
to
be
done
slowly
your
eyes
begin
to
close
to
the
cosmos
above
you
and
the
lake
before
you
your
mind
's
eye
becomes
clear
and
you
feel
your
body
once
again
tethered
to
the
physical
reality
you
rest
in
you
take
three
long
slow
deep
breaths
releasing
with
the
sigh
as
you
exhale
and
when
you
are
finished
with
those
three
breaths
just
allow
your
breath
to
return
to
its
natural
rhythm
and
as
you
move
deeper
into
the
night
you
let
yourself
go
completely
getting
the
past
and
releasing
the
future
all
that
matters
now
is
this
present
moment
as
well
as
the
energies
of
love
and
care
curiosity
and
tenderness
and
so
you
allow
yourself
to
be
here
to
be
bathed
in
these
soothing
energies
as
you
drift
into
the
restful
slumber
that
awaits
good
night

beach
covered
in
white
sad

the
palm
trees
growing
on
the
edge
of
this
sand

hair
ruffling
your
clothes

fluffy
white
clouds
float
past

the
chatter
of
birds
off
in
the
distance

it
all
in

sigh
out
any
stresses
of
the
day

to
notice
the
sights
and
sounds
around
you

start
to
sense
where
you
are

are
laying
on
your
back

slightly
with
the
sound
of
the
tired
and
your

breath

gentle
rocking
motion

judgment

inhale
melts
some
of

turquoise
water
reach
your
knees
and
elbows
bringing
warmth
to
achy
joints

continue
to
breathe
deeply

the
sound

exhalation

pull
you
out

you
further
from

sense
of

sea

from

the
water
around

draws
you
onward
these
tensions

on
the
surface
of

after
only
a
few
moments
they
to
relax
and
sink
into
the

are
the
only
thing
for
miles
and
you
are
totally
free
to

and
drift
wherever
you

Bob
's
up
and
down
slightly
as
you
pass
through
small
soothing
waves
allow
your
eyes
to
drift
upwards
and
notice
how
the
Sun
is
beginning
to
set
the
sky
is
beginning
to
turn

scarlet
streaks
appearing
against
bright
blue
as
you
watch
daytime
sky
begins
to
fade
giving
way
to
a
brilliant
mixture
of
pinks
reds
and
oranges
the
Sun
begins
to
drift
below
the
horizon
a
regal
sphere
returning
to
its
own
place
of
rest
as
it
sinks
lower
inky
blue
joins
the
brighter
colors
soothing
and
calm
while
you
continue
breathing
you
notice
that
although
the
Sun
has
gone
down
the
ocean
around
you
remains
warm
and
gentle
rocking
you
gently
across
its
surface
in
fact
the
darkness
around
you
leaves
you
free
to
enjoy
the
relaxation
and
aimlessness
the
water
brings
instead
of
noticing
the
science
around
you
you
focus
on
the
sensations
in
your
limbs
let
yourself
drift
further
if
any
thoughts
or
ideas
come
up
allow
the
current
around
you
to
wash
them
off
observe
them
without
worrying
as
you
drift
further
and
further
into
the
distance

the
concerns
you
leave
behind
relax
to
notice
the
way
they
sink
into
the
warm
comfort
of
this
tropical
sea

are
cleansed
of

of
worries
of
tensions

yourself
becoming
distracted

the
stars
above
you
watch
the
way
they
seem
to
move
as
you
drift
with
the
water
almost
as
if
they
too
were
being
lulled
into
relaxation
by
the
sound
of
your
breath
and
the
tired
feel
the
breeze
brush
against
you
carrying
with
the
salty
scent
of
the
sea
and
tropical
plants
allow
the
sounds
of
birds
animals
to
reach
you
their
quiet
cooing
calming
you
as
they
to
settle
down
for
the
night
in
this
place
everything
is
calm
every
part
of
the
landscape
beckons
you
reassuring
you
helping
you
release
all

the
warm
drifting
pall
of
the
water

are
safe
as
you
enjoy
the
warmth
around
you
the

deeper
and
deeper
into

be
cleansed

the
peace
and
safety
that
this

tropical
place
holds
as

release
worries
guided
meditation
for
a
deep
sleep
hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stephenson
and
welcome
to
this
gentle
end
to
your
day
you
are
listening
to
a
meditation
to
let
go
of
your
worries
before
falling
into
an
effortless
peaceful
sleep
over
the
course
of
the
next
30
minutes
or
so
you
'll
have
an
opportunity
journey
into
relaxation
letting
go
of
the
daily
things
that
weigh
down
your
body
mind
and
spirit
before
we
begin
take
a
moment
to
let
go
of
the
need
for
this
meditation
to
have
a
certain
outcome
perhaps
you
will
fall
asleep
during
this
recording
or
maybe
you
will
emerge
so
deeply
relaxed
free
of
all
stress
that
it
feels
like
you
have
had
a
wonderfully
restoring
nap
the
outcome
does
not
matter
all
that
counts
is
your
carefree
exploration
of
serenity
you
are
here
in
this
moment
it
's
yours
to
embrace
so
taking
in
a
deep
breath
now
breathing
in
through
your
nose
hold
it
for
a
second
and
release
slowly
releasing
all
the
stress
and
tension
through
your
nose
or
mouth
and
another
breath
in
breathing
in
through
the
nose
filling
your
diaphragm
hold
and
release
let
go
notice
the
way
your
body
feels
after
this
deep
inhalation
and
exhalation
do
you
feel
any
tension
or
pain
in
your
body
are
you
alert
tied
content
just
give
yourself
a
moment
to
reconnect
with
your
body
which
may
be
subservient
to
your
brain
during
your
waking
life

begin
now
by
returning
your
breathing
back
to
its
natural
rhythm
nothing
forced
nothing
strained
it
just
is
what
it
is
and
when
you
are
ready
notice
yourself
beginning
to
feel
a
little
heavier
the
way
you
might
feel
if
you
spent
the
afternoon
laying
in
the
Sun
or
when
you
've
taken
a
long
soak
in
a
hot
bath
your
eyelids
begin
to
droop
slipping
further
away
with
each
breath
take
this
opportunity
now
to
make
sure
everything
is
in
order
before
we
truly
begin
this
meditation
if
you
have
n't
already
set
an
alarm
and
you
need
to
do
that
just
do
that
now
and
make
sure
your
cell
phone
notifications
are
silenced
and
the
top
lines
are
drawn
[
Music

give
yourself
now
permission
to
embrace
the
sensations
in
your
body
however
comfortable
or
tense
they
may
be
do
not
force
yourself
to
change
anything
but
it
be
spontaneous
and
easy
do
not
need
to
strive
to
succeed
here
in
this
place
and
in
every
place
you
are
perfect
just
as
you
are
each
of
us
is
perfect
and
each
of
us
needs
a
little
work
let
this
realization
seep
into
you
replacing
anything
you
worry
about
with
a
calmness
that
permeates
every
fiber
of
your
being
[
Music

whatever
you
are
feeling
can
change
and
you
have
the
power
to
feel
just
the
way
you
want
to
this
is
you
here
in
the
moment
and
you
do
not
have
to
be
perfect
to
be
magnificent
meditation
is
a
journey
just
as
sleep
is
a
journey
and
you
do
not
need
to
concern
yourself
with
reaching
any
fixed
destination
instead
enjoy
each
breath
each
soft
inhale
and
exhale
as
you
find
yourself
drawn
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
relaxation
more
profound
than
you
could
have
ever
hoped
for
allow
all
your
thoughts
from
your
day
begin
to
melt
away
replaced
by
a
sense
of
effortless
calm
even
though
thoughts
may
appear
in
your
mind
's
eye
they
do
not
stay
long
but
just
allow
them
to
float
by
to
dissolve
leaving
you
in
a
heightened
sense
of
peace
and
gentle
awareness
they
are
just
like
dust
washed
clean
by
the
rain
disappearing
under
the
gentle
touch
of
your
slow
inhale
and
exhale
everything
you
are
worried
about
from
the
profound
to
the
everyday
drifts
away
leaving
you
an
increasingly
soothing
state
of
tranquillity
[
Music

if
any
other
worries
arise
during
the
course
of
this
meditation
you
may
simply

them
dissolve
away

cleansed
and
refreshed

for
you

from

out
in

as
you
feel
your
body
growing
heavier
more
restful
and
your
thoughts
softening
into
a
quiet
chatter
in
the
background
your
imagination
comes
to
life
visualize
yourself
standing
in
a
meadow
on
a
brilliantly
warm
sunny
day
wildflowers
of
all
shapes
sizes
and
colors
punctuate
the
soft
grass
butterflies
some
small
some
larger
flutter
from
flower
to
flower
some
way
off
you
hear
the
contented
buzz
of
a
honeybee
pleased
with
an
afternoon
of
pollen
gathering
the
soil
is
soft
under
your
bare
feet
warmed
by
the
Sun
above
your
head
fluffy
white
clouds
Scud
across
a
bright
blue
sky
your
heart
feels
warm
filled
with
gratitude
and
love
for
this
place

you
have
just
arrived

the
air
is
warm
and
the
Sun
is
gentle
on
your
cheeks
you
feel
loose
relaxed
let
yourself
sink
down
into
a
reclining
position
your
back
cushioned
by
the
lush
green
grass
underneath
you
a
butterfly
floats
overhead
moving
on
to

the

all
around

yourself
looking
upwards
watching
the
clouds
move
across
the
sky
they
to
calm
you
loving
your
body
into
an
even
deeper
tranquility
if
you
can
imagine
your
body
falling
asleep
in
this
mirror
growing
heavier
more
relaxed
your
spirit
may
not
want
to
sleep
yet
and
that
is
okay
perhaps
you
want
to
envision
your
spirits
standing
back
up
even
as
your
imaginary
body
falls
into
a
deep
and
restful
stillness
[

and
now
let
your
body
slumber
for
a
little
while
as
your
spirit
continues
its
journey
into
relaxation
your
body
will
rest
right
here
entirely
safe
entirely
secure
until
you
are
ready
to
return
to
it
no
harm
will
come
to
you
during
this
meditation
with
this
in
mind
turn
your
eyes
to
the
horizon
at
the
edge
of
the
meadow
you
can
see
a
leafy
green
band
of
trees
standing
Sentinel
the
majestic
guardians
of
this
sacred
space
in
your
heart
you
know
that
there
is
a
tree
there
's
that
is
taller
and
larger
than
the
others
far
more
ancient
than
those
that
grow
around
it
you
feel
inexplicably
drawn
toward
it
connected
at
a
deep
and
spiritually
significant
level
you
begin
to
walk
towards
the
edge
of
this
meadow
allow
yourself
to
move
towards
the
forest
following
the
path
that
appears
at
your
feet
and
leads
into
the
trees
as
you
approach
they
grow
taller
and
taller
in
your
vision
beginning
as
the
size
of
your
smallest
finger
in
the
distance
but
soon
towering
over
your
head
with
a
calm
wisdom
that
permeates
your
entire
being
as
you
step
under
the
canopy
you
feel
any
stress
or
strain
you
're
carrying
begin
to
loosen
falling
away
in
the
same
way
dried
leaves
fall
from
the
boughs
of
the
maple
in
autumn
everything
you
let
go
of
drifts
away
disappearing
already
decomposing
into
the
soil
that
will
nurture
the
trees
here
for
years
to
come
[
Music

the
sunshine
here
is
less
bright
dappled
and
soft
instead
of
its
usual
brash
gold
the
air
feels
a
little
cooler
a
little
moister
than
what
you
are
accustomed
to
and
yet
it
is
a
soothing
coolness
filled
with
the
scent
of
dry
leaves
wet
bark
and
soft
green
moss
all
around
you
stand
the
trunks
of
trees
and
saplings
some
tall
and
smooth
others
old
and
knild
there
are
younger
trees
too
skinny
and
gangly
as
they
grow
towards
sunlight
let
yourself
sense
the
slow
determination
of
these
trees
anchored
by
roots
as
long
as
the
tree
is
tall
the
trees
are
content
to
simply
be
here
calm
and
strong
against
the
weather
they
welcome
you
into
their
presence
greet
you
as
one
just
as
ancient
and
wise
as
they
are

as
you
breathe
deeply
watching
the
sunlight
meander
back
and
forth
as
the
trees
sway
in
the
breeze
bring
your
attention
back
to
your
spiritual
self
the
tree
sense
that
there
is
something
you
still
carry
with
you
a
mental
or
emotional
weight
that
troubles
you
even
in
this
place
it
is
safe
to
understand
it
here
perhaps
you
are
mourning
the
end
of
a
relationship
or
struggling
with
a
relationship
that
exists
now
maybe
you
are
tired
after
a
long
journey
toward
a
still
unreached
goal
perhaps
you
worry
about
money
or
health
either
for
yourself
or
for
someone
else
you
might
carry
guilt
or
regret
bitterness
or
perhaps
even
hatred

whatever
appears
does
not
make
you
evil
but
is
a
sign
of
yourself
outgrowing
something
that
once
used
to
fit
there's
no
need
to
judge
yourself
here
but
instead
calmly
regard
whatever
appears
in
your
mind
and
spirit

let
whatever
this
may
be
surface
within
you
and
when
you
have
looked
at
it
from
every
angle

as
a
handful
of
mud
materializing
in
your
hands
as
you
look
at
it
a
breeze
appears
drying
it
out
turning
it
to
dust
blowing
it
away
from
you
into

your
palms
are
clean

concern
in
your

the
way
the
sunlight
darts
about
moving
with
the
fluttering
leaves
but
also
heeling
wherever
your
soul
may
be
hurting
first
the
wind
cleansed
you

you
continue
your
walk
down
the
path
hearing
the
distant
chatter
of
squirrels
and
the
occasional
chirp
of
birds
the
path
leads
you
onwards
as
you
take
in
the
sounds
sights
and
smells
of
the
forest
drawing
you
onward
until
you
reach
the
oldest
tree
in
the
forest
this
particular
tree
has
a
trunk
so
large
that
a
cave
has
been
carved
out
within
the
middle
of
it
a
perfect
place
for
quiet
reflection
and
contemplation
its
bark
is
smooth
with
a
goldish
sheen
and
far
far
overhead
the
leaves
dance
in
the
breeze
with
an
almost
silvery
tint
this
tree
is
tall
taller
than
any
of
the
others
taller
than
the
tallest
building
you
have
ever
seen
you
sense
its
benevolence
the
warmth
with
which
it
welcomes
you
invite
you
into
its
magnificent
cave
deep
within
the
girth
of
its
trunk
except
its
invitation
you
begin
to
enter
the
cave
knowing
you
are
completely
safe
although
it
's
somewhat
dark
there
are
lit
candles
within
already
illuminating
the
inside
of
this
ancient
tree
your
soul
grows
light
or
with
each
step
as
the
cool
darkness
of
the
woods
gives
way
again
to
the
healing
candle
light
within
the
cave
helping
you
to
relax
deeper
almost
instantly
you
feel
calm
wiser
and
safe
you
feel
an
old
familiar
feeling
a
serenity
that
you
have
not
had
for
such
a
long
while
from
the
cave
you
can
see
out
to
the
entire
forest
witnessing
the
bobbing
leaves
of
the
other
trees
nearby
and
a
squirrel
scampering
about
far
off
in
the
distance
a
brightly
colored
swath
of
grass
and
flowers
catches
your
eye
it
is
the
meadow
and
you
can
see
your
physical
body
resting
totally
and
completely
on
this
blissful
summer
's
day
allow
yourself
to
enjoy
the
tranquility
of
the
cave
and
the
view
of
the
forest
feel
a
breeze
into
the
cave
and
ruffle
your
hair
and

hello
and
welcome
to
this
back
to
basics
guided
meditation
for
beginners
in
the
next
few
minutes
your
delve
into
meditation
with
me
as
your
guide
this
recording
is
designed
for
anyone
new
to
meditation
but
it
also
provides
an
opportunity
for
anyone
to
return
to
basics
and
rediscover
the
heart
of
their
practice
many
of
us
have
a
very
fixed
idea
of
what
meditation
is
perhaps
you
may
see
someone
sitting
cross-legged
on
a
pillow
and
chanting
or
even
refusing
to
speak
for
days
at
a
time
although
these
techniques
and
practices
can
deepen
your
understanding
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
they
do
not
necessarily
define
meditation
but
simply
meditating
is
becoming
attuned
to
yourself
finding
peace
and
stillness
in
the
midst
of
a
hectic
world
it
's
an
intensely
personal
experience
and
soon
you
will
find
yourself
developing
habits
and
preferences
for
your
own
practice
for
right
now
though
allow
yourself
to
release
all
of
your
expectations
for
what
you
will
encounter
in
the
next
few
minutes
and
open
yourself
to
a
world
of
infinite
possibilities
when
you
are
quiet
and
contemplative
any
mystery
can
reveal
itself
to
you
[
Music
]
we
will
begin
by
relaxing
if
you
have
not
already
situate
yourself
in
a
natural
relaxed
position
many
people
like
to
meditate
seated
in
a
comfortable
straight
back
chair
feet
firmly
resting
on
the
ground
with
hands
placed
gently
in
the
lap
you
may
prefer
a
different
position
perhaps
you
would
like
to
try
listening
to
this
recording
laying
down
or
with
your
feet
crossed
whatever
you
do
find
a
comfortable
posture
and
let
your
eyes
drift
closed
fill
your
ribs
and
belly
as
you
breathe
savor
the
heaviness
in
your
limbs
as
they
relax
letting
gravity
hold
you
in
its
gentle
embrace
you
can
feel
every
fiber
of
your
body
soften
relax
and
release
now
as
we
continue
through
this
meditation
let
everything
be
effortless
and
easy
continuation
of
your
physical
presence
give
yourself
permission
now
to
stop
planning
expecting
and
reacting
just
for
a
little
while
just
be
brave
in
[
Music
]
and
exhale
as
you
breathe
you
will
begin
to
notice
areas
in
your
body
that
feel
tense
or
uncomfortable
on
your
next
breath
in
imagine
your
breath
as
a
white
light
or
cool
breeze
feel
its
surge
through
your
body
touching
the
places
where
you
carry
tension
or
pain
then
as
you
exhale
this
tension
follows
your
breath
out
of
your
body
leaving
you
more
relaxed
than
before
[
Music
]
take
another
deep
breath
in
and
sigh
it
out
feel
your
shoulders
softening
the
corners
of
your
eyes
smoothie
and
your
belly
relaxing
[
Music
]
with
your
eyes
closed
the
world
outside
may
seem
sharper
notice
this
and
then
direct
your
attention
back
towards
yourself
notice
you
're
breathing
without
trying
to
change
our
daily
routines
are
busy
and
we
spend
much
of
our
lives
focused
on
things
outside
of
ourselves
deadlines
tasks
and
other
people
's
reactions
can
fill
our
consciousness
leaving
us
no
room
to
be
still
and
peaceful
bringing
your
attention
to
your
breath
is
one
of
the
fastest
and
simplest
methods
to
bring
you
into
sync
with
the
present
moment
if
thoughts
or
concerns
from
your
day
crop
up
acknowledge
their
presence
and
let
them
pass
you
by
when
you
emerge
from
this
meditation
you
will
remember
everything
you
need
to
do
so
there
is
no
need
to
grab
on
to
any
thought
right
now
this
is
your
time
to
be
light
and
relaxed
free
from
the
demands
of
daily
life
allow
your
breath
to
be
your
focus
as
you
slip
into
a
deeper
state
of
peace
and
comfort

hello
and
welcome
to
this
healing
space
guided
meditation
over
the
course
of
the
next
few
minutes
we
will
travel
together
into
contemplative
silence
and
then
open
the
doors
to
any
feelings
you
may
be
holding
inside
yourself
offering
them
a
safe
way
to
emerge
and
be
released
as
we
begin
make
yourself
comfortable
settle
in
and
begin
to
listen
to
the
rhythm
of
your
own
breath
allow
the
music
to
carry
you
deeper
as
you
begin
this
journey
into
your
own
mind
and

[

[

begin
to
let
go
of
the
thoughts
that
appear
in
your
mind
jockeying
for
attention
they
are
bright
and
exciting
but
they
will
lead
you
off
the
path
of
relaxation
and
into
the
arena
of
problem-solving
you
spend
so
much
of
your
waking
life
problem-solving
like
a
matador
against
a
never-ending
series
of
balls
he
do
not
need
to
do
this
now
this
is
your
chance
to
be
quiet
soft
tranquil
as
you
feel
your
breath
flowing
through
your
lungs
oxygen
transported
through
your
body
by
your
blood
let
your
breath
flow
through
you
dissolve
any
energy
blockage
or
muscle
tension
it
encounters
along
the
way
[

[

[

as
you
find
yourself
relaxing
more
deeply
muscles
softening
and
bones
resting
easily
let
your
mind
's
eye
open
and
your
imagination
take
flight
on
your
next
deep
exhale
you
are
sitting
beside
a
river
legs
crossed
and
hands
resting
on
your
knees
palms
up
it
is
night
here
and
the
sky
and
the
water
of
varying
depths
of
black
despite
this
you
know
that
you
are
absolutely
safe
here
and
that
as
long
as
you
continue
breathing
and
listening
to
this
meditation
nothing
bad
can
happen
to
you
so
take
this
opportunity
to
follow
your
breath
even
more
closely
feeling
every
minuscule
change
in
your
lungs
as
you
inhale
and
exhale

as
thoughts
come
up
look
them
in
the
eye
smile
and
give
them
permission
to
leave
you
they
bow
to
you
and
promise
that
if
you
need
to
speak
with
them
again
they
can
be
caught
up
at
a
moment
's
notice
they
do
not
want
to
disturb
you
during
this
time
for
you
so
allow
yourself
the
freedom
to
tend
to
them
later
this
space
is
a
space
for
your
healing
and
total
surrender
to
relaxation

and
now
bring
your
mind
's
eye
back
to
the
night
around
you
the
dark
water
ahead
of
you
feel
how
there
is
no
danger
nearby
as
you
are
protected
by
your
own
subconscious
mind
and
the
benevolence
of
the
world
surrounding
you
you
are
absolutely
safe
with
this
in
mind
let
your
imaginary
eyes
adjust
a
little
further
into
the
darkness
and
begin
to
notice
the
variations
in
the
night
the
places
where
some
of
the
deep
blue
or
black
a
lighter
than
others
embrace
the
silence
and
feel
the
tranquility
that
comes
with
it
in
this
space
your
hands
rest
on
your
knees
palm
up
they
are
receptive
to
whatever
emotions
arise
in
yourself
a
feeling
good
or
bad
appears
in
your
heart
and
as
it
does
you
begin
to
notice
a
paper
lantern
hovering
just
above
your
palms
growing
slowly
less
translucent
as
you
become
more
familiar
with
the
emotion
within
you
let
whatever
you
feel
fill
your
consciousness
passing
through
you
and
into
the
lantern
without
judgment
or
fear
feel
fully
but
let
yourself
feel
without
thinking
allowing
the
emotion
to
be
within
you
but
not
about
you
Oh
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
Oh
[
Music

there
is
a
candle
nestled
within
this
Lantern
and
as
you
allow
this
emotion
to
flow
through
you
a
small
flame
appears
with
your
every
breath
it
grows
a
bit
stronger
until
a
cheerful
tongue
of
flame
illuminates
the
paper
that
shelters
it
from
the
wind
no
matter
how
an
emotion
affects
you
it
is
beautiful
and
unique
just
as
this
lantern
is
exquisite
in
its
simplicity
take
a
moment
to
say
thank
you
to
the
wisdom
this
feeling
has
brought
you
as
you
carried
it
along
your
daily
journey
these
past
weeks
or
years
feel
gratitude
for
it
slight
well-up
in
your
chest
a
warmth
radiating
from
your
heart
outwards
and
then
when
you
are
ready
whisper
goodbye
as
the
lantern
begins
to
lift
away
from
your
palms
it
floats
higher
bobbing
gently
in
the
breeze
as
it
floats
upwards
stopping
high
above
your
head
its
candle
flame
is
golden
against
the
inky
night
sky
the
light
rippling
on
the
surface
of
the
water
admire
it
for
a
moment
and
then
return
to
your
hands
as
another
lantern
perhaps
a
different
color
or
pattern
begins
to
materialize
just
above
them
feel
the
emotions
run
through
you
and
when
you
are
ready
release
this
lantern
and
any
others
that
follow
it
into
the
sky
watching
a
constellation
of
candle
lights
appearing
in
the
sky
and
the

reflection
you
are
surrounded
by

at
all
the
lanterns
all
around
you
the
lights
that
flicker
in
the
sky
and
the
water
with
the
golden
warmth
these
are
the
feelings
that
you
have
carried
with
you
the
emotions
that
have
taught
you
much
but
are
no
longer
useful
on
your
journey
they
are
magnificent
but
they
are
temporary
and
you
may
let
them
go
take
a
moment
to
thank
them
again
for
their
presence
and
their
guidance
and
when
you
are
ready
sigh
out
your
breath
in
a
long
slow
wash
as
you
do
so
the
lanterns
Bob
gently
and
begin
to
float
upwards
lights
growing
smaller
and
smaller
until
they
are
like
tiny
pinpricks
in
the
sky
one
by
one
they
disappear
from
view
carried
far
out
into
space
to
dance
with
the

you
are
free

and
now
slowly
begin
to
bring
yourself
back
to
your
physical
body
calling
your
spirit
back
with
compassion
you
have
undergone
significant
healing
in
the
past
few
minutes
so
be
gentle
with
yourself
as
you
continue
your
daily
journeys
when
you
are

your

drift

you
are

youit
has
been
said
that
one
hour
of
yoga
nidra
equates
to
four
hours
of
deep
sleep
because
we
go
through
all
of
the
brainwave
stages
you
typically
go
through
during
sleep
only
in
a
compressed
amount
of
time
using
this
systematic
approach
to
full
body
and
mind
relaxation
can
help
you
connect
with
your
own
true
and
natural
wisdom
your
ability
for
healing
and
relieving
stress
if
you
are
feeling
stressed
this
practice
can
be
just
what
you
need
to
experience
inner
peace
and
joy
it
is
also
a
great
way
to
help
you
fall
asleep
and
sleep
deeply
if
you
practice
before
bed
get
ready
to
heal
and
restore
your
body
quiet
your

are
on
Oasis
where
you
can
come
to
tap
into

inner
peace
positive
mindset
and
the
ability
for
self
healing
before
you
begin
to
settle
into
your
comfortable
yoga
nidra
posture
it
is
important
for
you
to
set
a
specific
intention

personal
resolve
for
the
practice
so
you
can
commit
to
it
at
the
start
let
it
sink
into
your
subconscious
during
and
revisit
it
when
the
practice
is
coming
to
a
close
this
intention
is
called
a
San
culpa
this
San
culpa
can
help
you
make
a
positive
change
in
your
life
as
your
brain
enters
delta-wave
frequencies
where
you
are
very
receptive
to
change
for
your
San
culpa
choose
something
that
aligns
with
your
deepest
desires
this
statement
is
positive
in
nature
and
is
in
the
present
tense
you
may
choose
to
start
the
statement
using
the
words
I
am
as
you
are
solidifying
your
intention
feel
it
in
your
heart
as
if
it
is
true
perhaps
imagine
what
your
life
might
be
like
when
it
is
true
you
can
keep
the
same
San
culpa
for
as
long
as
you
like
and
come
back
to
this
practice
frequently
to
send
a
consistent
message
to
your
subconscious
feel
free
to
pause
this
recording
to
take
time
to
set
your
intention
maybe
write
it
down
on
a
small
piece
of
paper
to
keep
with
you
after
your
practice
is
complete
now
I
would
like
to
take
a
brief
moment
to
give
you
some
suggestions
for
your
setup
as
it
is
important
to
be
extremely
comfortable
and
feel
safe
in
the
position
you
choose
for
your
yoga
nidra
practice
you
can
choose
to
lie
down
on
the
floor
or
in
your
bed
for
this
practice
you
will
want
to
be
fully
supported
the
intent
is
not
to
go
to
sleep
it
is
to
relax
your
body
fully
so
you
can
relax
your
mind
and
let
go
of
stress
you
may
choose
to
have
your
head
and
shoulders
slightly
elevated
to
make
sure
you
stay
awake
you
can
use
a
yoga
bolster
a
pillow
a
rolled
blanket
or
towel
under
your
knees
to
make
sure
there
is
no
strain
in
your
lower
back
you
may
like
a
pillow
or
a
blanket
under
your
head
as
well
and
I
recommend
covering
up
with
a
blanket
as
your
body
temperature
will
drop
as
you
become
more
and
more
relaxed
and
finally
if
you
like
you
can
cover
your
eyes
with
a
washcloth
or
eye
pillow
now
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
close
your
eyes
if
you
like
and
settle
into
comfort

let
your
body
sink
into
the
surface
below

make
any
shifts
in

settle
deeper

be
comforted

at
this

is
nowhere

to

rest

not

you
do
n't

everything
I
say
it
is
natural
to
flow
in

out

I

a
wonderful
dayHello
my
loves
,
welcome
to
a
guided
sleep
meditation
by
Lavendaire
.
This
meditation
will
help
you
relax
your
body
and
your
mind
,
preparing
you
for
a
peaceful
,
deep
sleep
.
We
will
start
in
a
seated
posture
,
and
then
move
onto
a
lying
posture
later
on
.
Please
find
a
comfortable
seated
position
on
your
bed
.
It
might
help
to
add
a
pillow
under
you
for
support
.
...
Rest
your
hands
on
your
knees
,
with
your
palms
facing
up
.
Close
your
eyes
.
Take
a
moment
to
feel
your
body
,
and
feel
the
natural
flow
of
your
breath
.
...
Regardless
of
what
happened
in
your
day
,
it
is
time
to
let
it
go
.
Release
your
day
,
release
all
the
worries
,
release
all
the
stress
.
You
do
n't
need
it
anymore
.
We
'll
take
5
deep
breaths
,
with
an
open
mouth
exhale
.
When
you
inhale
,
think
of
peace
.
When
you
exhale
,
let
go
of
any
tension
that
you
may
be
holding
onto
,
both
in
your
body
and
in
your
mind
.
With
each
exhale
,
find
a
deeper
&
deeper
level
of
release
.
Take
a
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
,
filling
up
the
space
in
the
bottom
of
your
belly
...
Then
a
deep
exhale
out
through
your
mouth
,
releasing
all
the
worries
and
tension
from
your
day
.
Take
another
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
,
breathing
in
peace
,
And
a
big
exhale
out
through
your
mouth
,
exhaling
all
the
stress
...
Deep
inhale
through
your
nose
,
let
the
air
reach
deep
into
your
belly
...
And
a
deep
exhale
out
through
your
mouth
,
letting
go
...
Another
deep
inhale
through
your
nose
,
Exhale
and
let
it
all
out
...
feel
your
body
soften
&
relax
...
Final
deep
breathe
in
...
inviting
peace
...
And
exhale
...
drop
your
shoulders
and
release
...
Become
aware
of
how
your
body
feels
now
.
And
how
your
breath
grows
slower
and
deeper
as
you
relax
.
....
The
mind
and
body
are
one
.
When
our
mind
relaxes
,
our
body
relaxes
,
and
vice
versa
.
When
we
feel
stress
or
anxiety
,
our
bodies
hold
onto
these
emotions
as
physical
tension
,
and
it
makes
it
harder
for
us
to
relax
and
sleep
well
.
Every
night
,
make
time
to
clear
your
mind
and
relax
your
body
.
This
is
your
time
to
love
and
nurture
your
mind
,
body
,
and
soul
.
Now
,
we
will
do
some
gentle
stretches
to
further
relax
the
body
.
Let
's
start
with
some
neck
stretches
.
Take
a
deep
breath
in…
And
on
your
exhale
,
bring
your
chin
down
to
stretch
the
back
of
your
neck
.
If
you
want
a
deeper
stretch
,
you
can
gently
place
your
hands
behind
your
head
.
Hold
here
for
two
full
breaths
,
breathing
through
the
tension
with
each
exhale
.
On
your
next
exhale
bring
your
chin
to
neutral
and
face
forward
.
Onto
side
neck
stretches
.
Gently
tilt
your
head
to
the
right
,
and
hold
for
three
deep
breaths
.
If
you
want
a
deeper
stretch
,
you
can
gently
place
your
right
hand
on
your
head…
Reset
on
your
3rd
breath
.
Now
do
the
opposite
side
.
Tilt
your
head
slowly
to
the
left
,
and
hold
for
three
deep
breaths
....
Reset
on
your
next
exhale…
Now
let
's
do
a
couple
neck
circles
on
each
side
..
While
inhaling
,
slowly
roll
your
head
to
the
right
,
back
,
then
exhale
to
the
left
,
and
then
down…
gently
at
your
own
pace
,
do
one
more
round…inhaling
for
the
first
half
,
exhaling
for
the
2nd
half
.....
Now
switch
directions
.
Slowly
circle
your
neck
the
other
way
,
inhaling
to
the
left
,
back
,
exhaling
to
the
right
,
and
down
.
Repeat
for
one
more
round…
When
you
’
re
done
,
take
a
deep
breath
and
open
mouth
exhale
to
reset
.
Next
,
do
5
shoulder
rolls
in
each
direction
.
Inhale
and
bring
your
shoulders
forward
and
up
,
then
roll
them
back
then
down
.
Repeat
this
circular
motion
four
more
times
,
deep
breathing
throughout
....
Now
roll
your
shoulders
5
times
in
the
the
opposite
direction
,
deep
breathing
throughout
and
loosening
up
your
shoulder
muscles
.
....
Take
a
deep
breath
and
reset
.
Notice
how
your
body
feels
now
.
Now
that
you
've
begun
stretching
,
listen
to
your
body
.
Where
else
would
you
like
to
stretch
and
release
tension
?
Follow
your
intuition
and
what
your
body
craves
....
Maybe
you
want
to
stretch
your
legs
and
reach
for
your
toes
.
Maybe
you
want
to
lay
down
and
do
some
spinal
twists
.
Whatever
it
may
be
,
listen
to
your
body
and
follow
what
your
body
is
telling
you
.....
Remember
to
deep
breathe
through
each
stretch
.

Whenever
you
're
ready
,
move
into
a
lying
position
.
We
'll
start
with
a
slow
breathing
exercise
with
3
slow
breaths
.
Take
a
deep
breath
into
your
abdomen
...
hold
it
there
for
3
seconds
,
and
exhale
slowly
,
elongating
your
exhale
as
much
as
you
can
....

in
through
your
nose
,
breathing
into
your
abdomen

breath
like
that

inhale
into
your

hold
it
for
3
seconds
..
and
then
slowly
exhale
until
you
have
no
more
air
left
.
Take
a
healing
breath
in
,
and
exhale
it
out
...
Feel
your
breath
and
heart
rate
slow
down
.
It
is
time
to
completely
let
go
,
and
allow
yourself
to
just
be
.
We
will
now
relax
the
entire
body
,
bringing
awareness
to
one
area
at
a
time
.
With
each
area
,
feel

the
bed—into

Feel

Take
a
slow
deep
breath
in
...
and
a
slow
deep
breath
out
....
allowing

body
to
sink
into
your
bed

as
dimensions
fold
upon
themselves
curving
inwards
like
pages
to
reveal
other
realities

from

you
explore
seeing
things
you

you
wish
to
have
and
so
you
choose
to
stand
amongst
the
stars
they
move
and
swirl
in
cyclones
and
waves
they
shine
with
an
incomparable
brightness
and
yet
the
brightness
does
not
hurt
your
eyes
it
's
as
if
you
were
looking
at
a
soft
glow
instead
you
encircle
them
in
or
of
what
is
happening
you
stick
out
your
hands
and
the
stars
fall
through
the
center
of
your
palms
and
zip
through
the
sky
notice
that
the
sound
they
make
as
they
dash
through
the
sky
as
you
look
down
the
middle
of
the
cyclone
you
can
see
the
stars
racing
rapidly
through
multiple
dimensional
layers
all
at
once
what
marvelous
things
do
you
see

with
complete
trust

you
give
yourself
to
the
eye
of
the
cyclone
and
you
like
the
stars
race
down
through
the
galaxies
as
you
fly
down
when
you
run
your
fingers
across
and
down
the
body
of
the
stars
somehow
they
do
not
feel
separate
from
you
it
is
as
if
you
are
experiencing
your
own
touch
looking
around
you
can
see
other
beautiful
beings
dancing
upon
the
Stars
as
they
continue
their
descent
as
you
fly
downward
you
begin
to
feel
a
familiar
sensation
of
home
closer
and
closer
the
sensation
grows
and
suddenly
the
stars
disappear
and
your
feet
may
planted
on
a
field
of
tall
green
grass
[
Music

there
is
immediate
stillness
the
contrast
between
the
stillness
of
standing
versus
the
inertia
of
flying
puzzles
you
for
a
moment
and
you
stand
there
taking
note
of
all
that
surrounds
you
the
blades
of
grass
feel
cool
soft
and
moist
between
your
toes
you
look
around
fields
of
flowers
being
caressed
by
a
golden
stream
of
light
the
Golden
Lion
draws
near
to
you
moving
through
the
air
like
a
snake
you
desire
to
feel
it
touch
you
and
so
it
is
the
golden
light
runs
over
your
arms
and
suddenly
your
arms
feel
much
warmer
you
take
this
light
into
your
hands
and
form
a
ball
staring
at
this
ball
you
create
the
most
radiant
color
patterns
you
have
ever
seen
all
colliding
and
spilling
inside
of
this
golden
sphere
you
place
the
ball
onto
your
chest
and
it
seeps
through
to
your
heart
warming
it
instantly
you
look
down
and
watch
the
colors
run
through
the
insides
of
your
body
you
can
see
every
vein
within
you
is
filled
with
light
your
entire
body
warms
and
you
are
overwhelmed
with
joy
the
light
has
filled
up

an
orange
light

a
moment
to

dull
glow

chakra
is
the
home
of
your
willpower

sense
of
belonging

sinks
deeper
into
the
bed
engulfed
in
a
sea
of
relaxation
your
consciousness
calm
and
at
ease
turned
its
attention
to
the
fourth
chakra
lit
by
an
emerald
light

at
your
heart
this
chakra
like
the
ancient
heart
symbol
represents
love
and
compassion
for
yourself
and
others
in
its
purest
state
this
love
is
unconditional
unreserved
and
filled
with
joy
love
is
a
part
of
everything
from
the
way
you
order
a
meal
at
a
restaurant
to
the
way
you
talk
to
your
body
for
many
of
us
love
is
a
subject
tightened
with
anger
pain
and
distrust

you
breathe
allow
your
mind
to
disconnect
from
past
relationships
experiences

to
love
others
without
reason
or
expectation

feel
a
breath
rise
a
little
higher
stopping
at
your
throat
noticing
the
bright
blue
light
that
emanates
from
this
part
of
your
spiritual
consciousness
the
chakra
addresses
speaking
out
truths
sharing
our
creativity
and
ideas
and
moderating
the
balance
of
sharing
and
listening
as
you
breathe
a
little
deeper
feeling
muscle
tension
dissolving
away
ask
yourself
if
this
blue
light
is
as
vibrant
as
you
would
like
is
this
something
that
you
need
to
say
that
you
have
n't
yet
have
you
said
something

regret

you
balance
your
speaking
with
listening
your
creativity
with
rest
if
not

gently
at
yourself
and
forgive
even
as
you
allow
your
focus
to
strengthen
this
area
to
better
represent
your
spiritual
intelligence
and
magnificent
wisdom
and
as
this
light
grows
brighter
cleaner
more
pure
feel
your
body
sink
a
little
deeper
into
your
bed
the
blankets
around
you
soothing
your

your
spirit
grows
stronger
and
brighter
than

above
this
bright
blue
light
is
the
darker
regal
glow
of
your
sixth
chakra
the
third
eye
chakra
it
is
located
just
between
your
eyebrows
and
governs
your
ability
to
see
and
understand
seeing
in
this
context
does
not
just
imply
the
physical
act
of
viewing
what
is
around
you
instead
it
allows
you
to
perceive
the
meaning
of
what
you
witness
allow
yourself
to
reflect
on
whether
you
have
been
missing
the
obvious
or
seeing
things
where
there
are
none
if
you
find
yourself
skewed
one
way
or
another
simply
allow
your
breath
to
realign
your
body
and
spirit
as
you
feel
your
intuitive
self
grow
in
confidence
and
clarity
breathe
and
feel
this
chakra
between
your
eyes
notice
the
sensations
that
come
with
it
so
you
understand
when
the
third
eye
begins
to
communicate
through
your
physical
presence
[

[

and
now
your
awareness
reaches
your
seventh
chakra
the
crown
chakra
which
inhabits
no
physical
space
in
your
body
but
instead
hovers
above
your
scalp
like
a
halo
some
people
perceive
this
chakra
as
a
royal
purple
while
others
see
it
as
brilliant
white
the
combination
of
all
other
colors
of
light
whatever
you
may
see
here
allow
your
consciousness
to
ponder
the
phrase
I
know
for
it
is
this
Madra
that
guides
this
chakra
boredom
depression
and
confusion
can
result
in
an
imbalance
in
this
area
for
it
is
the
crown
chakra
that
helps
us
focus
not
on
ourselves
as
individuals
but
on
ourselves
as
a
part
of
a
greater
whole
so
breathe
in
welcoming
the
unity
that
comes
from
the
being
part
of
something
greater
and
feel
your
physical

revel
in
the
unity
of
mind

and

breathe
in
and
let
go

and
now
give
yourself
a
moment
to
understand
the
way

feels
in
your
body
[

since
the
rainbow
of
light
that
begins
at
your
tailbone
and
runs
all
the

up
your

illuminating
your

hello
and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
my
name
is
Jason
and
over
the
course
of
the
next
half
hour
or
so
we
will
journey
into
relaxation
leaving
your
thoughts
and
worries
behind
as
you
saw
through
the
sky
this
is
a
meditation
about
flying
if
you
are
uncomfortable
with
heights
or
nervous
about
the
idea
of
floating
on
the
air
do
n't
worry
as
long
as
you
listen
to
the
sounds
of
this
meditation
no
harm
can
befall
you
you
are
entirely
magnificently
safe
free
to
drift
with
ease
of
any
a
great
burden
with
this
in
mind
make
sure
you
've
found
a
comfortable
position
and
when
you
are
ready
settle
in
and
let
your
eyes
drift
closed
take
a
moment
to
get
back
in
touch
with
your
breath
how
does
it
feel
to
inhabit
your
body
right
now
are
there
any
areas
that
seem
more
tense
than
usual
can
you
let
go
of
that
pain
just
for
a
little
bit
and
now
turn
your
attention
to
your
mind
to
the
constant
dialog
that
accompanies
you
through
your
waking
life
are
there
any
sticking
points
in
your
thoughts
or
does
your
stream-of-consciousness
flow
through
your
mind
easily
nothing
left
behind
if
there
is
an
issue
a
memory
or
a
person
who
keeps
cropping
up
ask
yourself
if
you
can
let
go
of
it
just
for
a
little
bit
even
the
most
pleasant
of
thoughts
and
memories
can
cloud
your
meditation
experience
keep
you
from
focusing
and
enjoying
the
present
moment
when
you
are
ready
turn
your
attention
away
from
your
body
and
your
thoughts
and
toward
your
breath
let
the
oxygen
flow
a
little
bit
slower
a
little
bit
deeper
[
Music

and
as
you
breathe
allow
your
conscious
mind
to
shut
down
and
your
imagination
to
awaken
your
body
sinks
deeper
into
the
chair
or
mattress
as
your
imagination
wakes
up
bringing
you
visions
of
bright
blue
skies
the
sensation
of
flight
[
Music

imagine
yourself
standing
up
from
your
chair
or
bed
wherever
you
might
be
right
now
imagine
yourself
walking
out
of
this
room
all
the
way
to
the
front
door
of
your
home
or
office
[

as
you
stand
outside
on
the
sidewalk
you
take
a
giant
leap
into
the
air
as
you
do
so
you
find
the
air
support
you
hold
you
suspended
on
your
next
inhale
the
wind
catches
you
lifting
you
gently
upward
or
quickly
or
as
slowly
as
you
would
like
you
are
flying
in
control
of
the
direction
and
the
speed
of
your
path
take
a
moment
to
experiment
with
your
newfound
ability
dipping
and
twirling
through
the
air
as
the
wind
tickles
your
cheese

far
below
you
the
ground
looks
like
thousands
of
tiny
rugs
all
laid
together
pinpricks
of
light
spill
across
the
landscape
like
glitter
punctuated
every
so
often
by
the
fluffy
green
of
a
stand
of
trees
lakes
and
rivers
squiggle
through
the
dusty
plains
and
grassy
Dells
houses
are
sorted
neatly
into
little
rectangular
yards
divided
up
by
narrow
ribbons
of
gray
pavements
highway
and

roadways
meander
around
sharp
mountain
peaks
the
vehicles
traveling
along
them
with
tiny
flakes
of
color
even
the
most
chaotic
sides
where
the
construction

neatly
organized

everything
has
a
pattern
articulated
through
swoops
and
grids
and
arcs
visible
only
from
the
air
if
you
would
like
now
you
can
take
some
moments
to
examine
them
more
closely
or
you
can
simply
let
go
and
enjoy
the
experience
of
flight

an
important
surrender

's
you

that
accumulates
over
the
day
just
from
standing
and
walking
bring
your
focus
to
the
soles
of
your
feet

how
much
tension
there
is
to
let
go
of
there

the
light
tingle
in
your
arches
and
toes

's
the
relief
of
not
having
to
hold
the
body
to
wait
any
longer
as
you
continue
to
scan
your
body
moving
up
from
the
feet
let
the
rest
of
your
muscles
follow
suit

one
by
one

's
time

give
up
and

gravity
cradle
you
into
your
bed

the
chakras
and
your
higher
self
guided
meditation
hello
and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
join
me
and
trusting
in
my
work
this
meditation
will
consist
of
a
body
relaxation
to
begin
with
followed
by
the
spoken
chakra
and
communing
with
your
higher
self
too
often
we
get
so
caught
up
in
our
lives
that
we
forget
to
really
live
and
really
living
means
existing
beyond
the
confines
and
demands
of
schedules
immediate
wants
and
needs
the
expectations
of
others
and
the
need
to
conform
I
wonder
if
you
can
remember
what
it
was
like
as
a
child
what
it
was
like
to
just
be
to
live
and
to
be
joyful
without
a
question
to
live
free
of
doubt
and
self-criticism
it
's
all
about
being
in
the
moment
enjoying
it
free
of
expectations
and
just
being
alive
William
Blake
put
it
best
when
he
wrote
to
see
a
world
in
a
grain
of
sand
and
a
heaven
in
a
wild
flower
hold
infinity
in
the
palm
of
your
hand
and
eternity
in
an
hour
it's
and
so
beautiful
but
I
guess
we
think
but
how
can
you
hold
infinity
in
the
palm
of
your
hand
and
eternity
in
an
hour
is
it
even
possible
yes
it
is
true.you
exists
in
all
things
and
all
things
exist
within
you
when
you
truly
understand
that
you
experience
the
entire
universe
within
yourself
and
yourself
as
the
entire
universe
once
you
experience
that
then
you
grasp
that
heaven
already
dwells
within
you
as
does
infinity
within
that
heaven
lies
all
possibility
and
all
joy
and
with
that
infinite
space
lies
infinite
wisdom
and
infinite
power
all
begins
with
breath
the
bridge
between
your
smaller
self
and
your
higher
self
let
's
begin
just
finding
a
comfortable
place
either
seated
or
lying
down
making
sure
there
are
no
distractions
for
the
next
30
minutes
or
so
and
just
breathing
in
and
out
now
through
your
nose
and
seeing
if
you
can
slow
your
breath
down
to
a
count
of
three
so
breathing
in
on
a
count
of
three
through
your
nose
and
releasing
that
breath
on
a
count
of
three
so
it
's
inhaling
one
two
three
exhale
one
two
three
and
just
see
if
you
can
keep
a
steady
rhythm
similar
to
this
but
that
's
comfortable
for
you
the
remainder
of
this
meditation
we
'll
begin
with
a
body
scan
now
just
becoming
aware
of
your
body
and
starting
at
the
top
of
your
head
noticing
any
sensations
here
the
density
and
the
space
this
area
takes
up
and
including
in
that
awareness
as
your
phorid
I
'm
aware
of
this
area
[
Music
]
without
judgment
just
being
aware
and
feeling
any
sensations
that
may
arise
[

and
taking
in
and
awareness
of
your
eyes
your
ears
your
nose
and
cheeks
[

]
your
mouth
and
lips
or
teeth
the
entire
face
sensing
any
sensations
even
sensing
where
the
air
meets
your
skin
and
becoming
aware
moment
by
moment
if
any
sensations
or
feelings
that
you
feel
come
and
go
and
during
this
time
if
your
mind
wanders
that
's
simply
okay
just
allow
it
to
be
your
only
role
is
to
simply
acknowledge
your
thought
if
it
wanders
and
then
come
back
to
focusing
on
the
parts
of
your
body
my
voice
and
sensations
that
you
feel
[
Music

so
we
're
going
to
shift
that
focus
now
from
the
top
of
your
head
and
your
face
moving
it
down
to
the
neck
your
shoulders
you
might
even
feel
your
shoulders
relaxed
a
little
this
is
a
place
where
we
store
a
lot
of
tension
our
shoulders
and
our
shoulder
blades
also
being
aware
of
your
neck
and
your
throat
area
[
Music

you
're
sensing
what
is
going
on
here
[

you
might
even
be
able
to
feel
air
coming
and
going
in
the
throat
area
moving
down
now
to
focus
on
your
arms
elbows
[

and
your
forearms
[

and
down
to
your
wrists
and
your
hands
[

your
hands
may
be
either
resting
on
your
lap
or
at
your
side
right
down
to
your
fingertips
[

see
if
you
can
sense
the
weight
of
your
hands
and
each
individual
finger
[

and
any
sensations
that
you
may
feel
just
being
aware
moment
by
moment
[

and
shifting
your
awareness
now
up
to
your
chest
area
you
may
sense
the
rise
and
fall
of
your
chest
the
subtle
rise
and
fall
[

and
bringing
your
awareness
to
your
ribcage
the
front
the
sides
of
your
ribcage
and
ride
around
your
upper
back
its
resting
either
against
the
chair
or
on
the
mattress
of
your
bed
if
you
sense
any
tension
or
aches
or
pains
just
bring
a
gentle
awareness
to
this
not
forcing
any
pain
or
aches
away
but
rather
just
simply
being
aware
[

moving
that
awareness
down
now
to
the
abdomen
area
your
stomach
feeling
sensations
here
you
may
feel
it
softening
releasing
and
just
the
chest
you
may
feel
your
belly
rising
and
falling
as
the
air
comes
and
goes
whatever
you
feel
whatever
you
sense
just
be
open
and
aware
and
accept
[

and
shifting
that
awareness
now
to
the
lower
back
area
[
Music

you
may
send
some
pressure
here
[
Music

and
continue
to
shift
your
focus
to
the
pelvis
area
your
buttocks
being
aware
the
space
that
this
takes
up
the
air
against
your
skin
any
sensations
that
you
may
feel
allow
them
to
come
and
go
with
full
acceptance
[
Music
]
continue
now
to
bring
your
awareness
to
your
thighs
the
top
of
your
thighs
besides
inner
thighs
and
underneath
you
may
feel
the
pressure
of
where
you
're
laying
or
seated
sensing
the
weight
of
your
legs
if
your
mind
begins
to
wander
at
all
that
's
okay
just
simply
bring
it
back
now
to
focusing
on
your
thighs
and
moving
now
down
to
focusing
on
your
knees
the
top
bony
part
of
your
knee
and
the
inner
fleshy
part
underneath
in
full
awareness
just
accepting
anything
that
comes
and
goes
any
sensations
feelings
thoughts
with
full
acceptance
[
Music
]
you
may
become
aware
of
some
discomfort
or
pain
that
is
okay
to
just
be
with
this
[
Music
]
moving
your
attention
now
to
your
calf
muscles
of
both
legs
if
you
were
lying
down
in
bed
you
may
feel
the
calf
muscles
spread
against
your
bed
[
Music

and
shifting
around
your
shins
and
finally
bringing
your
attention
to
both
of
your
feet
the
soles
of
your
feet
any
pressure
that
's
attending
here
the
breach
of
both
feet
ankles
and
right
down
to
your
toes
each
single
toe
you
may
even
sense
the
space
between
each
toe
[

[

just
checking
in
on
your
breathing
now
and
feeling
this
breath
sustaining
you
breathing
in
and
out
throughout
your
entire
body
[

and
seeing
if
you
can
take
in

the
awareness
of
your
entire
body
from
your
feet
all
the
way
up
to
the

of
your

[

accepting
all

moments

allow

to
relax
further
[
Music

I
'd
like
you
to
bring
your
focus
now
to
the
base
of
your
spine
[

and
Eli
's
your
first
chakra
the
part
of

second
chakra
the
part
of
yourself
that

for
your
existence
as
you
exhale
mentally
say
to
yourself
by
desire
and
just
stay
with
this
for
a

breaths
[
Music

now
if
you
'd
bring
your
attention
to
your
belly
button
this
is
your
third
chakra
area
which
gives
you
the
urge
to
act

in-breath
here
and
as
you
exhale

this
breath
going
here
for
a
few
moments
focusing
now
on
your
solar
plexus
and
this
is
located
just
beneath
the
midpoint
of
your
chest
and
this
is
your
fourth
chakra
the
part
of
you
that
feels

your
in-breath
here

of
your
throat
and
here
lies
your
fifth
chakra
the
part
of
you
that
expresses

in-breath
here
and
as
you
exhale
mentally
say
to
yourself
and
make
myself
known
and
please
keep
this
up
for
the
span
of
a
few
breaths
now
bringing
your
focus
to
the
space
between
your
brows
this
is
where
your
sixth
chakra
is
the
part
of
you
the
comprehends
breathe
into
this
spot
and
as
you
exhale
mentally
say
to
yourself
I
understand
and
stay
here
for
a
few
moments
[
Music
]
now
with
your
eyes
still
closed
see
if
you
can
raise
your
eyes
and
try
to
look
at
the
roof
of
your
head
do
n't
strain
yourself
just
if
you
feel
discomfort
or
pain
just
lower
your
gaze
until
you
find
a
position
you
're
comfortable
with
here
at
the
top
of
your
head
lie
as
your
seventh
chakra
the
part
of
you
that
understands
things
free
of
prejudice
discrimination
feeling
and
attachment
so
bring
your
in-breath
E
and
as
you
exhale
mentally
say
to
yourself
I
know
and
we
'll
stay
here
for
a
few
moments
shifting
your
awareness
now
to
pay
attention
to
your
entire
length
of
your
spine
visualize
it
as
a
white
pillar
of
light
whose
bottom
starts
at
the
base
of
your
spine
rising
up
through
your
body
up
past
your
neck
rises
through
the
middle
of
your
head
and
right
to
the
top
of
your
head
if
it
helps
you
can
imagine
that
your
entire
body
is
a
pole
made
of
pure
white
light
one
end
of
that
light
rises
up
through
the
middle
topmost
part
of
your
head
stretching
many
miles
above
you
with
your
eyes
raised
as
high
as
you
can
comfortably
lift
try
to
see
where
that
light
goes
as
it
rises
up
past
the
roof
of
your
head
although
that
beam
of
light
goes
off
into
eternity
there
is
a
sort
of
barrier
that
lies
some
12
inches
above
your
head
this
is
the
eighth
chakra
also
called
the
great
sound
from
your
perspective
it
might
look
like
an
umbrella
or
as
if
you
were
sitting
beneath
a
great
transparent
jellyfish
loading
some
12
inches
above
your
head
it
's
also
called
the
witness
the
part
of
you
that
's
attached
to
your
body
but
is
n't
in
your
body
[
Music
]
this
witness
is
the
midway
point
between
your
physical
self
and
your
higher
self
which
has
never
been
born
and
can
never
die
you
might
like
to
think
of
it
as
a
boy
bobbing
on
the
water
's
surface
beneath
that
boy
is
a
string
attached
to
the
oceans
floor
the
beam
of
light
that
starts
at
the
base
of
your
spine
and
shoots
out
through
the
top
of
your
head
between
the
boy
on
the
water
's
surface
and
the
anchor
that
keeps
it
bound
to
the
oceans
for
liars
and
not
and
that
knot
is
the
witness
connecting
your
physical
body
your
highest
self
which
never
lives
and
never
dies
[
Music
]
rising
up
that
beam
of
light
that
point
some
12
inches
above
your
head
is
a
light
body
it
's
a
detached
version
of
you
one
that
knows
your
likes
and
dislikes
your
passions
and
urges
it
does
n't
judge
you
simply
observes
and
record
your
thoughts
and
your
feelings
without
thinking
or
feeling
them
[
Music
]
as
the
witness
you
sent
your
body
below
feel
it
breathing
gently
beneath
you
[
Music
]
as
you
witness
you
feel
and
see
the
line
of
light
stretching
forth
above
you
toward
infinity
there
is
an
ebb
and
flow
of
impressions
and
sensations
that
your
lower
self
transmits
to
you
in
flashes
remember
there
you
sit
a
float
in
a
timeless
sense
of
being
you
are
light
made
of
light
and
encased
in
light
emitting
light
from
that
perspective
you
see
but
do
not
judge
the
actions
of
your
lower
self
you
see
it
scrambled
back
and
forth
like
a
toddler
just
learning
to
walk
like
a
child
it
makes
mistakes
as
it
was
born
to
do
but
how
else
can
it
learn
[
Music
]
this
is
part
and
parcel
of
who
and
what
it
is
that
one
that
sits
a
liar
's
in
meditation
is
calling
out
to
you
but
may
feel
lost
alone
adrift
or
in
need
of
guidance
may
feel
disconnected
confused
and
grounded
it
reaches
for
you
as
a
toddler
reaches
out
to
its
mother
just
listening
now
it
asks
for
guidance
reach
out
simply
reach
out
and
reminder
that
it
is
loved
it
has
always
been
loved
and
will
always
be
loved
[
Music

with
each
in-breath
that
draws
the
memory
of
you
deeper
into
itself
with
each
out
breath
it
stretches
forth
and
reaches
out
to
you
here
in
this
moment
[
Music
]
let
the
barriers
of
memory
weaken
so
that
the
body
sitting
below
you
can
feel
you
again
feel
its
gentle
rhythmic
in-breath
and
out-breath
expand
and
contract
its
wondrous
body
drawing
you
in
with
each
inhalation
and
reaching
out
to
you
with
each
exhalation
guide
it
that
it
may
live
in
wisdom
and
power
so
that
it
may
make
the
right
choices
at
the
right
time
in
the
right
place
and
with
the
right
people

it

it
may
live
in
dignity
and
grace
making
the
right
choices
at
the
right
time
at
the
right
place

the
right
people

it

it
may
live
in
peace
and
joy

to
you

you

the
need
arises
always
at
the
right
time
at
the
right
place

with
the

through
your
guidance
may
had
finally
learn
to
see
the
world
in
a
grain
of
sand
and
heaven
in
everyone
and
everything

the

its
own
existence
and
eternity
in
the
joy
of
every
breath

passing
moment

your

back
to
the
top
of
your
head

all
that
light
of
your
own
power
above
you
and
know

you

hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
sleep
meditation
hypnosis
over
the
course
of
the
next
few
minutes
we
will
journey
through
four
different
environments
exploring
peace
and
relaxation
in
the
context
of
each
one
of
them
at
the
end
you
will
have
the
freedom
to
select
the
right
one
for
you
attuning
your
spiritual
surroundings
to
what
you
need
for
health
healing
and
your
happiness
with
this
in
mind
allow
a
calm
sense
of
expectation
to
rise
in
your
mind
and
set
an
intention
to
rest
deeply
and
completely
feel
your
body
relaxed
more
than
it
has
in
a
long
while
all
the
tension
in
your
body
dissolving
bit
by
bit
let
every
muscle
in
your
body
relax
even
those
in
the
place
you
normally
hold
tired
this
may
be
your
forehead
your
lips
or
jaw
the
back
of
your
head
your
shoulder
blades
your
lower
back
your
belly
your
knees
or
ankles
and
right
down
to
the
tendons
in
your
feet
feel
your
whole
body
melt
into
wherever
you
rest
and
allow
the
surface
around
you
to
support
your
body
let
's
begin
our
meditation
so
lying
down
keeping
your
back
straight
as
much
as
you
can
feel
your
body
becoming
more
serene
you
are
still
and
peaceful
in
this
breath
and
the
next
as
you
relax
you
begin
to
hear
the
crash
of
water
in
the
distance
as
you
sink
a
little
deeper
into
relaxation
it
grows
louder
until
you
yourself
are
standing
on
the
banks
of
an
enormous
waterfall
it
is
morning
and
the
sunlight
catches
the
water
as
it
falls
creating
thousands
of
tiny
rainbows
in
the
spray
around
the
cliff
the
rumble
of
moving
water
is
at
once
both
soothing
and
awe-inspiring
a
symphony
of
Earth
's
very
essence
tumbling
around
you
take
a
moment
to
breathe
in
this
majesty
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
as
you
look
more
closely
at
the
waterfall
bill
the
cool
mist
envelop
your
face
leaving
dewy
droplets
on
your
cheeks
and
Florida
feel
the
vitality
and
power
of
this
place
all
around
you
in
the
warmth
of
the
cliff
bases
the
gentle
glow
of
the
Sun
the
frothy
water
around
the
Falls
notice
yourself
becoming
karma
beginning
to
let
go
of
your
worries
and
physical
tension
allow
yourself
to
breathe
letting
the
rush
of
the
water
guide
you
into
a
deeper
relaxation
allow
yourself
to
feel
the
slow
transitions
from
inhale
to
exhale
and
from
exhale
to
inhale
note
the
tiny
delicate
paws
in
the
center
of
these
transitions
that
space
where
inhalation
ends
but
before
exhalation
begins
breathe
as
deeply
or
as
shallowly
as
comfortable
for
you
your
chest
moving
rhythmically
and
effortlessly
as
you
sink
a
little
deeper
into
relaxation
letting
go
of
any
worry
or
stress
if
at
any
time
your
mind
wanders
simply
bring
it
gently
back
to
your
breath
a
calming
gentle
process
of
bringing
air
into
your
lungs
feel
any
tension
in
your
body
lift
away
with
every
breath
you
take
nothing
can
hurt
you
here
enjoy
these
next
few
moments
next
to
the
waterfall
letting
your
worries
dissolve
under
the
relentless
rumble
of
fresh
rainwater
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
as
you
notice
the
sounds
of
the
meditation
begin
to
change
allow
your
imagination
to
follow
your
feelings
to
follow
creating
around
you
a
magnificent
sandy
beach
waves
break
in
crystalline
sprays
and
the
call
of
seagulls
eases
your
mind
smell
the
sharp
tang
of
salt
and
the
warm
dustiness
of
hot
sand
let
your
shoulders
droop
and
your
fora
done
crease
in
the
background
you
can
hear
the
wash
of
the
ocean
waves
breaking
on
the
beach
you
can
watch
the
water
if
you
like
or
close
your
imaginary
eyes
and
simply
dwell
in
the
presence
of
your
other
senses
breathe
and
listen
let
everything
else
go
so
much
of
meditation
is
the
practice
of
letting
go
of
accepting
that
you
can
not
control
everything
around
you
of
welcoming
in
the
infinite
glorious
possibilities
and
opportunities
that
are
waiting
for
you
letting
go
of
your
conscious
discipline
your
task
oriented
nature
is
the
gateway
to
relaxation
so
taking
a
breath
in
and
exhale
letting
go
of
the
need
to
control
your
experience
just
for
a
few
minutes
allow
yourself
to
feel
whatever
arises
letting
go
of
everything
negative
and
treasuring
the
beauty
of
this
moment
's
experience
as
your
body
lets
go
of
any
tension
your
breath
slows
down
and
it
may
deepen
just
a
slight
bit
simply
follow
its
rhythm
listening
to
the
quiet
in
and
out
of
air
in
your
lungs
if
you
would
like
match
your
breath
to
the
tempo
of
the
sea
nearby
following
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
waves
behind
whatever
feels
most
comfortable
most
relaxing
and
embrace
it
this
is
your
chance
to
discover
and
choose
whatever
you
need
to
rest
most
fully
and
again
as
the
music
and
sounds
of
this
meditation
begin
to
change
allow
yourself
to
be
transported
to
the
banks
of
a
freshwater
brook
or
river
where
fish
jump
and
the
sunlight
glints
on
the
wet
rocks
as
you
take
a
deep
inhale
you
breathe
in
the
burbling
sound
of
water
on
stones
and
the
gentle
sigh
of
wind
in
the
young
tree
boughs
take
another
deep
breath
and
then
release
it
relishing
the
warmth
of
the
air
that
leaves
your
body
feel
your
feet
sink
into
the
soft
grass
of
the
riverbank
and
notice
the
bright
green
color
of
early
spring
if
you
would
like
you
may
dip
your
foot
into
the
stream
noticing
the
way
the
water
washes
over
your
toes
cooling
your
skin
you
can
hear
a
few
honeybees
buzzing
about
enjoying
the
landscape
as
much
as
you
are
you
know
that
the
bees
will
not
harm
you
and
so
you
can
continue
to
enjoy
the
gentle
harmony
they
make
a
soft
sound
that
sets
off
the
silver
tinkling
music
of
the
creek
a
little
way
in
front
of
you
a
butterfly
flutters
on
the
breeze
dipping
and
soaring
with
the
invisible
current
of
the
wind
you
hold
out
your
hand
and
it
floats
closer
to
you
landing
on
your
skin
with
an
almost
imperceptible
touch
allow
yourself
to
lay
down
on
the
riverbanks
feeling
the
way
the
grass
molds
around
your
body
supporting
your
back
and
neck
so
you
can
relax
more
completely
above
you
you
can
see
a
fluffy
white
cloud
a
clear
blue
sky
all
around
you
are
the
sounds
of
nature
peaceful
and
rhythmic
your
thoughts
disappeared
replaced
by
this
music
of
nature
you
can
feel
all
the
aches
and
pains
in
your
body
dissolve
away
as
you
sink
a
little
deeper
into
the
warm
grass
relaxed
and
at
peace
in
this
beautiful
landscape
give
yourself
permission
to
enjoy
it
as
you
breathe
you
feel
yourself
growing
lighter
more
relaxed
almost
as
if
the
stresses
and
tensions
of
the
day
are
being
washed
away
in
the
cheerful
sound
of
the
river
breathe
in
welcoming
inspiration
and
peace
breathe
out
exhaling
worry
and
fear
this
is
your
time
embrace
it
now
in
these
next
few
moments
and
now
as
the
music
and
sounds
around
you
change
one
small
breathe
in
and
find
yourself
on
the
path
of
a
majestic
and
ancient
forest
the
trail
through
the
forest
is
verdant
lined
with
the
carpet
of
the
grass
your
feet
sink
into
it's
slightly
brushing
against
the
soft
coolness
of
its
surface
birds
sing
in
the
trees
a
symphony
of
natural
beauty
some
chirp
back
and
forth
others
trill
melodies
into
the
wind
a
gentle
breeze
sways
in
the
trees
and
the
soft
touch
of
its
passing
soothes
your
skin
the
sunshine
is
less
bright
here
dappled
and
soft
instead
of
its
usual
brash
gold
the
air
feels
a
little
cooler
a
little
moister
than
what
you
are
accustomed
to
and
yet
it
is
a
soothing
coolness
filled
with
the
scent
of
dry
leaves
wet
bark
and
soft
green
moss

as
you
walk
further
and
deeper
into
the
forest
the
trees
become
larger
their
trunks
wider
and
spaced
further
apart
in
the
resulting
space
hangs
a
mantle
of
pearly
fog
floating
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
as
you
walk
your
legs
stir
the
fog
and
it
swirls
around
you
gauzy
tendrils
lazy
soft
against
your
skin
birdsong
accompanies
you
along
your
journey
lifting
your
spirit
and
soothing
your
body
with
its
innocent
sounds
let
your
self
marvel
at
the
size
of
these
trees
as
wide
around
as
dining
tables
and
almost
taller
than
your
eyes
can
see
smell
the
dampness
of
believes
and
dirt
underneath
them
nourishing
and
protecting
their
roots
imagine
how
far
these
tree
's
roots
must
extend
into
the
earth
in
order
to
remain
sturdy
and
upright
above
all
allow
the
nature's
music
to
guide
you
into
further
relaxation
as
you
breathe
deeply
watching
the
sunlight
meander
back
and
forth
as
the
trees
sway
in
the
breeze
bring
your
attention
to
yourself
are
you
holding
any
tension
or
is
there
any
pain
in
your
body
are
you
carrying
or
holding
on
to
something
in
your
back
your
neck
or
your
shoulders
is
there
tension
in
your
hips
or
perhaps
the
way
you
squeeze
your
eyelid
shut
how
does
it
feel
to
be
you
right
now
you
are
still
and
tranquil
United
with
this
peaceful
an
ageless
environment
feel
your
body
relaxing
as
you
breathe
a
little
deeper
letting
go
of
anything
that
might
distract
you
let
yourself
focus
completely
on
the
beauty
of
the
forest
sense
it
feel
what
it
's
like
welcoming
the
harmony
and
stillness
that
accompanies
it

allow
your
attention
to
travel
across
your
body
noticing
how
deeply
your
muscles
and
tendons
have
relaxed
since
now
the
space
between
your
thoughts
the
ease
with
which
your
mind
moves
between
thoughts
never
lingering
too
long
on
one
subject
you
feel
calm
peaceful
and
daddy
's
now
in
this
state
of
quiet
peace
as
this

spoken
part
comes
to
an
end
allow
your
mind
to
return
to
that
place
savoring
the
beautiful
details
as
you
sink
further
into
this
state
of
happy
equanimity
let
your

guide
you
and
enjoy
the
final
moments
of
music
as
you
drift
off
into
a
deep
and
peaceful

release
all
mind
matters
a
meditation
just
prior
to
sleeping
begin
to
find
your
connection
to
yourself
a
constant
unbreakable
tie
that
might
have
been
silenced
or
ignored
throughout
the
course
of
a
busy
day
only
you
know
what
you
went
through
today
and
only
you
can
begin
to
release
its
hold
on
you
tomorrow
will
be
another
day
but
for
now
this
is
time
just
for
you
time
for
stillness
clarity
and
relaxation
finding
a
comfortable
place
either
seated
or
lying
down
and
taking
a
breath
breathing
in
and
release
let
that
breath
go
and
again
breathing
in
and
release
let
that
breath
go
in
and
let
go
as
we
get
further
in
tation
relax
even
further
over
the
course
of
our
time
together
we
examine
everything
your
mind
dwells
on
and
use
your
breath
to
release
everything
in
preparation
for
a
deep
and
healing
rest
if
it
helps
you
imagine
that
you
are
passing
these
worries
on
to
a
higher
power
or
greater
wisdom
in
the
universe
allowing
this
presence
to
carry
your
burden
until
you
elect
to
pick
it
back
up
again
if
you
find
this
challenging
simply
imagine
your
thoughts
melting
dissolving
or
blowing
away
according
to
what
feels
most
natural
to
you
let's
begin
the
beginning
portion
of
any
meditation
practice
is
the
most
challenging
give
your
mind
permission
to
take
a
break
from
all
its
work
this
is
time
for
rest
and
healing
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
exhale
as
you
breathe
start
to
let
go
of
your
expectations
for
this
meditation
everything
is
happening
as
it
should
even
if
you
do
n't
realize
it
even
if
you
do
n't
see
it
even
if
you
do
n't
expect
it
to
especially
then
underneath
it
all
lies
a
web
of
connections
and
new
and
beautiful
threads
are
being
added
every
day
breathe
deeper
and
that
someday
soon
you
will
be
able
to
find
meaning
in
what
might
at
first
appear
to
be
a
giant
tangle
you
do
not
need
to
look
or
sound
a
certain
way
to
find
deep
peace
and
contentment
follow
your
heart
and
intuition
slow
and
effortless
is
a
time
now
for
letting
go
this
may
be
a
guided
meditation
but
it
is
not
a
scripted
meditation
it
's
up
to
you
to
find
your
place
your
breathing
and
your
Zen
within
it
you
are
guided
not
led
and
this
practice
is
your
own
so
make
it
yours
as
you
breathe
in
and
exhale
sink
deeper
and
relax

this
meditation
is
a
sleep
meditation
but
it
is
okay
if
you
do
not
fall
asleep
at
the
end
of
it
ultimately
this
meditation
practice
is
about
gaining
greater
calm
and
stillness
within
your
own
life
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
exhale
feeling
the
microscopic
changes
in
your
body
as
you
do
this
trust
that
your
body
knows
what
it
needs
if
you
fall
asleep
before
the
end
of
this
recording
perhaps
you
are
in
need
of
a
little
extra
rest
and
if
you
make
it
all
the
way
through
your
body
desires
a
relief
from
the
physical
pressures
of
the
thoughts
that
are
weighing
you
down
right
now
nothing
here
is
good
or
bad
right
or
wrong
you
are
simply
you
caught
in
a
current
of
ever
deepening
relaxation
embrace
these
since
a
even
as
you
let
go
of
your
expectations
for
sleep
[

if
you
are
upset
about
your
own
watered
expectations
for
yourself
release
them
plants
goals
hopes
dreams
intentions
desires
whatever
you
name
them
let
go
letting
something
or
someone
else
carry
them
as
you
rest
you
may
reclaim
them
whenever
you
desire
but
for
now
simply
breathe
trust
that
everything
is
happening
at
the
correct
pace
trust
that
things
are
happening
in
the
right
order
know
that
everything
even
the
gray
successes
look
like
failures
in
the
thick
of
things
you
have
permission
from
yourself
and
others
to
rest
to
tend
to
your
own
well-being
and
sometimes
the
person
who
needs
this
reminder
most
is
you
and
so
breathe
a
little
deeper
because
you
can
allow
your
limbs
to
relax
a
little
further
because
it
's
possible
and
give
yourself
permission
luxurious
decadent
permission
to
fall
deeply
and
powerfully
asleep
it
is
not
a
command
only
permission
your
body
may
do
whatever
it
pleases
sinking
even
deeper
into
the
peace
and
comfort
of
the
present
moment

it
does
not
matter
what
you
are
worried
about
at
this
moment
know
that
there
are
thousands
of
other
people
in

world
undergoing
the
same

similar
pain
concerns
about
health
appearance
money
Korea

in

all

these

for

in
pain
there
are
two
people

beings
or
presences
sending
them
positive
energy
and
blessings
at
this
very

if
you
have
the
strength
send
your
own
loving
healing
energy
out
into
the
world
extending
love
and
hope
to
your
fellow

on
your
next
inhale

returning
to

anything

anything
it
will
only
tempt
you
and
snare
you
keep
you
from
the
deep
restful

you
so
deeply
desire

give
yourself
permission
to
let
go
of
the
worries
all
the

give
even
this
anxiousness
a

uncomfortable
every

greetings
my
friends
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
sleep
meditation
guardians
of
the
rainforest
where
you
will
journey
deep
into
the
lush
rainforests
and
your
questions
will
be
answered
allowing
you
to
drift
into
a
deep
and
restful
sleep
[

just
making
sure
that
you
are
comfortable
now
completely
comfortable
lying
on
your
back
with
your
arms
by
your
side
wriggling
around
until
you
get
comfortable
gently
closing
your
eyes
and
using
this
initial
time
to
take
in
a
number
of
deep
breaths
sending
that
breath
all
the
way
down
to
your
belly
area
breathing
in
through
your
nose
and
out
through
your
mouth
as
you
're
breathing
in
be
comfortable
where
you
are
and
knowing
that
you
're
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
for
this
moment
[

[

and
returning
your
breath
to
a
natural
comfortable
rhythm
in
and
out
through
your
nose
as
you
do
this
becoming
aware
of
the
sensations
of
the
breath
as
it
goes
into
your
belly
we
feel
it
expand
does
n't
leaves
your
belly
you
feel
your
belly
just
go
down
slightly
this
is
not
a
forced
breath
or
forced
movement
rather
it
's
just
a
reaction
a
natural
reaction
to
the
breath
going
in
and
out
moment
by
moment
breath
by
breath

I
'd
like
you
to
become
aware
now
of
your
entire
body
where
your
body
meets
the
bed
where
your
heels
are
resting
your
arms
and
your
hands
lying
by
your
side
and
feeling
the
weight
of
your
body
feeling
the
sensations
of
the
sheets
or
blankets
against
your
body
or
the
pillow
supporting
your
head
[
Music
]
and
what
I
'd
like
you
to
do
in
these
next
few
moments
is
to
allow
a
body
scan
from
the
top
of
your
head
right
down
slowly
to
the
tips
of
your
toes
and
as
you
scan
your
body
you
're
going
to
go
along
and
witness
any
sensations
that
might
be
happening
within
various
parts
of
your
body
now
this
may
be
physical
sensations
or
it
may
be
even
stored
emotions
it
's
not
about
changing
anything
it
's
just
about
being
present
with
your
body
your
physical
sensations
and
your
emotions
so
scanning
now
from
the
top
of
your
head
right
down
to
the
tip
of
your
toes
and
take
a
few
minutes
to
do
this
and
I
will
return

[

I
'd
like
you
to
visualize
yourself
now
entering
a
lush
green
rain
forest
a
place
that
seems
almost
magical
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
old
trees
and
foliage
and
a
river
that
meanders
to
the
right
side
of
you
you
begin
to
go
down
to
this
river
and
walk
alongside
it
as
you
do
paying
attention
to
the
sounds
of
this
river
the
healing
sensations
that
it
delivers
to
you
you
are
at
peace
here
there
's
no
one
else
to
disturb
you
only
you
and
nature
each
time
a
thought
comes
up
for
you
allow
that
thought
to
float
by
and
you
might
like
to
project
that
thought
into
the
river
and
allow
that
thought
to
trickle
downstream
actually
see
that
the
thought
beginning
to
be
placed
into
the
river
and
beginning
to
leave
you
watch
it
as
it
goes
the
tune
comes
to
your
mind
row
row
row
your
boat
gently
down
the
stream
merrily
merrily
merrily
merrily
life
is
but
a
dream
the
river
and
all
the
stones
within
the
river
are
here
today
to
have
lessons
to
teach
you
gentle
lessons
reminders
because
you
already
know
inherently
what
it
is
here
to
teach
you
as
you
continue
to
walk
up
a
slanted
hill
the
gentle
rivers
still
rolling
along
beside
you
you
hear
it
whisper
to
you
you
already
have
everything
you
need
it
says
you
already
have
everything
you
need
this
reminder
circulates
throughout
you
at
times
you
might
be
striving
wanting
reaching
desiring
something
else
to
come
in
your
life
the
river
is
here
to
tell
you
that
you
are
already
connected
to
everything
that
is
and
whatever
you
need
whatever
you
desire
is
really
only
a
thought
away
from
your
reality
it
all
begins
with
a
thought
you
are
the
co-creator
of
your
life
it's
almost
like
you
can
let
go
of
the
striving
this
is
not
by
any
means
being
lazy
rather
it
's
simply
surrendering
to
the
process
and
trusting
that
your
gentle
actions
are
already
in
place
manifesting
your
desires
take
a
moment
now
to
visualize
the
river
and
put
your
hands
in
allow
the
waters
to
splash
to
your
face
be
grateful
for
this
river
and
for
all
you
have
within
your
life
at
this
time
you
might
want
to
say
a
silent
thank
you
as
you
continue
on
to
move
upwards
the
Sun
peers
through
the
top
of
the
canopy
of
the
rain
forest
creating
almost
a
halo
effect
around
you
warming
you
soothing
you
you
can
almost
feel
the
vibration
of
the
cells
within
your
body
as
they
come
alive
from
this
beautiful
sunlight
you
stand
still
in
this
place
and
allow
the
sun
's
rays
to
sink
into
your
mind
your
body
and
spirit
and
so
you
continue
the
gentle
sounds
of
the
river
following
you
as
you
continue
on
your
path
you
take
some
time
now
to
sit
at
the
riverbank
and
allow
your
feet
to
soak
within
the
cool
water
enjoy
the
coolness
of
the
water
as
it
flows
between
your
toes
around
your
feet
and
feeling
the
gravelly
earth
within
the
riverbed
itself
soothing
your
feet
you
might
even
want
to
rub
them
with
in
this
gravelly
earth
almost
like
a
massage
for
your
feet
as
you
look
upstream
you
begin
to
see
a
bottle
floating
down
with
a
note
inside
it
as
it
comes
closer
to
you
you
catch
the
bottle
and
you
pour
the
cork
out
and
read
the
note
as
you
open
up
the
note
take
a
look
at
what
it
says
you
read
the
note
the
words
materialize
almost
out
of
thin
air
they
say
you
are
loved
for
the
uniqueness
of
who
you
are
go
out
there
and
shine
and
let
it
be
known
to
the
world
here
is
another
reminder
to
you
that
something
you
inherently
already
know
and
yet
sometimes
you
dismiss
this
you
do
n't
feel
worthy
you
do
n't
feel
that
you
were
good
enough
well
this
note
is
here
to
tell
you
that
right
now
you
are
loved
you
are
worthy
and
you
are
perfect
in
this
very
moment
and
it
's
calling
out
for
you
to
truly
recognize
this
and
to
acknowledge
this
to
feel
this
with
all
your
entire
being
and
once
you
acknowledge
this
you
give
a
mission
for
others
to
light
up
their
lives
too
for
others
to
recognize
the
love
within
themselves
just
take
a
few
moments
to
sit
with
this
to
sit
with
this
love
within
you
you
might
begin
to
feel
it
radiating
from
the
inside
out
allowing
your
body
to
grow
lighter
and
shine
brighter
with
every
breath
in
and
out
you
take
this
note
and
you
place
it
back
into
the
bottle
and
put
the
cork
back
on
throwing
it
back
into
the
river
and
allowing
someone
else
downstream
to
receive
the
same
message
you
begin
to
get
up
and
continue
on
your
journey
[
Music
]
as
you
continue
on
a
little
squirrel
runs
past
you
he
stops
looks
at
you
you
look
at
him
and
even
if
only
for
a
few
moments
you
connect
with
him
your
eyes
meet
the
squirrel
looks
peaceful
in
this
environment
content
and
he
's
here
to
simply
remind
you
that
in
this
moment
you
're
content
that
you
can
allow
thoughts
of
yesterday
and
worries
or
concerns
of
tomorrow
to
let
go
because
these
are
not
your
reality
your
reality
is
only
in
this
present
moment
this
is
your
reality
right
here
in
this
forest
now
this
is
your
reality
you
feel
this
wonderful
connection
with
this
squirrel
and
he
scampers
away
you
continue
on
climbing
inclines
and
steeper
Hills
the
river
still
below
you
babbling
away
as
you
reach
the
top
of
the
hill
you
see
an
enormous
pine
tree
with
a
wooden
rope
ladder
and
you
begin
to
climb
this
tree
you
are
safe
you
feel
safe
up
and
up
you
go
[
Music

beginning
to
be
far
above
the
river
and
this
tree
continues
on
even
past
the
top
of
the
canopy
so
right
now
you
are
up
the
top
of
this
tree
you
see
a
hammock
swinging
from
branch
to
branch
just
the
perfect
size
for
you
and
decide
to
spend
some
time
swinging
laying
down
with
in
this
hammock
right
above
the
beautiful
lush
rainforest
you
're
comforted
here
and
supported
and
of
course
safe
just
enjoy
lying
here
whilst
the
Sun
envelops
you
soothes
you
and
comfort
you

the

penetrating

deep
down
into

just
as
you
are
enjoying
this
sunlight
this
gentle
swinging
of
the
hammock
from
high
above
the
forest
and
the
river
a
gentle
tapping
is
on
your
right
shoulder
and
as
you
open
your
eyes
you
see
a
baby
chimpanzee
he
looks
in
your
eyes
with
a
joyous
smile
he
just
gently
pat
your
head
for
a
moment
and
it
's
like
he
's
communicating
directly
to
you
with
no
word
spoken
reminding
you
of
your
child
within
and
the
joyous
times
you
've
had
as
a
child
think
of
how
simple
it
was
no
concerns
no
worries
no
problems
just
happy
within
that
moment
at
one
particular
moment
see
if
you
can
recall
a
particular
moment
as
a
child
when
you
were
happy
recall
what
it
felt
like
see
if
you
can
pinpoint
where
that
joy
sprung
from
that
excitement
and
he's
here
to
remind
you
that
this
joy
this
inner
child
this
happiness
is
always
within
you
and
you
may
sometimes
need
to
take
a
little
more
time
out
to
connect
with
this
joy
to
do
what
pleases
you
to
do
what
makes
you
smile
and
to
look
after
that
little
girl
or
boy
that
is
within
you
and
has
always
been
within
you
do
what
makes
this
little
child
feel
happy
and
you
can
carry
this
back
into
your
waking
life
the
chimpanzee
looks
at
you
with
a
mischievous
grin
and
he
bounds
away
swinging
from
one
vine
to
the
next
calling
out
as
he
goes
you
decide
to
have
one
last
look
around
at
the
top
of
this
canopy
before
you
begin
to
climb
back
down
the
wooden
rope
ladder
as
you
go
down
thanking
the
mischievous
monkey
breeze
lessons
on
your
inner
child
you
finally
reach
the
floor
of
the
forest
and
continue
now
on
your
journey
beginning
to
go
downhill
again
getting
closer
and
closer
to
the
riverbank
as
you
continue
downwards
towards
the
river
you
see
an
old
man
sitting
in
the
seat
it
's
a
carved
out
wooden
log
the
seat
that
has
probably
been
here
for
centuries
he
's
a
frail
old
man
and
he
turns
to
see
you
he
motioned
you
to
come
and
sit
with
him
and
he
has
a
glint
of
joy
within
his
eyes
he
says
to
you
just
for
this
moment
be
still
no
thoughts
needed
just
be
still
and
enjoy
the
sounds
of
the
beautiful
rainforest
around
you
and
so
you
sit
with
him
and
begin
to
listen
and
it
's
like
the
sounds
of
the
rainforest
a
magnified
a
symphony
of
nature
to
your
ears
just
enjoy
these
next
few
moments
[
Applause
]
you
turn
to
look
at
the
frail
old
man
and
he
reminds
you
never
be
afraid
to
take
time
out
to
do
nothing
because
in
that
nothingness
there
is
everything
that
you
need
contained
there
you
acknowledge
this
and
you
say
goodbye
to
the
old
man
and
you
continue
on
your
journey
as
you
continue
on
the
meandering
path
alongside
the
river
the
sounds
of
water
gushing
begin
to
get
louder
and
louder
it
seems
like
there
is
a
large
waterfall
ahead
excitedly
you
continue
to
move
towards
the
sound
the
sound
gets
louder
and
begins
to
wash
all
over
you
reverberating
through
your
entire
body
as
you
turn
a
corner
a
giant
waterfall
is
seen
a
large
cavern
behind
the
100-foot
waterfall
water
cascading
way
above
your
head
it
's
just
you
here
you
and
the
waterfall
and
nature
you
edged
yourself
close
to
the
waterfall
and
put
your
arm
underneath
it
you
can
feel
the
heaviness
of
the
water
as
a
pounds
against
your
arms
and
hands
it
's
cool
but
not
too
cold
you
see
a
little
trail
that
leads
behind
the
cavern
of
this
giant
waterfall
and
you
decide
to
go
under
this
and
from
here
you
can
see
the
water
pounding
right
in
front
of
you
splashing
down
to
the
rocks
and
the
river
below
this
waterfall
is
here
to
remind
you
of
the
strength
you
have
within
any
obstacles
that
come
forth
in
your
life
but
you
have
this
power
within
to
overcome
them
to
see
them
through
no
matter
how
dark
these
times
may
be
this
strength
this
inner
strength
can
overcome
almost
any
obstacle
set
before
you
and
if
there
is
an
obstacle
that
ca
n't
be
moved
just
like
the
waterfall
it
just
travels
around
it
and
moves
onwards
not
stopping
not
fearing
just
continuing
to
move
with
the
flow
of
life
you
are
how
you
are
strength
just
be
with
this
for
a
moment
and
allow
the
water
to
fall
reminding
you
of
all
the
strength
you
have
all
your
ever
need
is
right
within
you
right
at
this
moment
you
head
on
now
back
out
from
under
the
cabin
back
in
the
direction
where
you
came
you
thank
the
waterfowl
for
the
reminder
as
you
begin
to
follow
the
river
back
downstream
going
with
the
flow
of
life
you
continue
on
with
in
the
forest
with
the
flow
of
the
river
passing
the
old
man
once
more
still
seated
on
the
carved
out
wooden
chair
you
acknowledge
each
other
and
move
on
you
pass
the
wooden
rope
ladder
again
a
chimpanzee
the
squirrel
and
just
as
you
begin
to
get
closer
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
a
Sun
shower
begins
to
fall
gently
down
rather
than
running
from
this
you
rejoice
in
this
and
look
upwards
and
see
this
water
gently
coming
down
and
refreshing
you
reminding
you
to
surrender
to
life
but
whatever
comes
up
for
you
to
not
try
and
force
things
aside
to
not
try
and
push
motions
down
[
Music
]
but
rather
to
acknowledge
everything
that
happens
and
surrender
to
it
allow
it
to
be
and
this
makes
your
job
in
life
so
much
easier
so
much
more
comfortable
and
joyous
it
's
almost
like
you
can
use
life
as
your
playground
you
do
n't
have
to
tighten
your
grip
on
anything
it
just
be
enjoy
whatever
happens
at
any
point
in
given
time
allow
it
to
be
and
in
allowing
it
to
be
as
it
is
it
gives
you
so
much
power
and
strength
you're
acknowledging
this
present
moment
you
wo
n't
have
to
get
lost
in
the
past
or
in
the
future
within
your
mind
these
can
be
waste
of
time
and
this
is
all
you
have
right
here
and
now
so
just
stand
here
and
allow
this
gentle
Sun
shower
to
wash
away
old
thoughts
or
remaining
concern
and
be
truly
present
coming
back
now
you
're
leaving
the
forest
as
you
do
take
one
more
moment
to
glance
back
and
to
thank
the
forest
for
all
it
has
offered
you
today
but
every
reminder
that
it
has
given
you
right
now
you
're
returning
to
your
body
where
you
can
continue
on
begin
to
sleep

with
the
knowing

now
there
is
nothing

present
and
allow
yourself
to
enjoy
these
moments
and

make
your
way
through
the
final
stretch
of
trees
before
emerging
onto
the
flat
rock
of
this
majestic
mountain
's
peak
you
breathe
in
and
release
a
deep
sigh
your
jaw
drops
and
your
heart
widens
to
the
beauty
of
the
world
that
extends
around
you

forests
down

out
in

you
are
witnessing
the
world
from
this
heightened
perspective
as
if
for
the
very
first
time
and
as
the
gentle
breeze
rushes
against
your
skin
you
remember
your
intention
for
coming
here
to
release
what
no
longer
serves
you
and
to
welcome
the
winds
of
change
that
will
propel
you
forward
and
so
here
standing
upon

mountaintop
you
let
come
to

any
and
all
of
the
negative
thoughts
that
no
longer
serve
you
when
they
arise
they
do
not
stay
with
you
for
long
as
you
surrender
them
up
to
the
wind
that
dances
through
the
atmosphere
all
around
you
surrender
with
the
breath
exhalation
by
exhalation
each
thought
each
feeling
and
every
negative
knot
of
energy
that
holds
you
back
from
realizing
your
true
potential
let
the
wind
carry
them
away
from
you

you
vibrantly
alive

allow
the
muscles
around

to
relax
now

your

your
heart
and
as
you
gaze
out
upon
the
wonder
of
the

all
around
you
silently
set
an
intention
to
nourish
yourself
with
positive

to
come
take
one
more
long
deep
breath
in

when
you
release

go
of
any
residual
negative
energy
with
a
deep
sigh
let
it
out

slowly
now

the

come
back
to
the
natural
rhythm
of
your
breathing

into
your

into
the
earth
supporting
you
from

when
you
are
ready
you

gently
let

back
into

open

hello
and
welcome
to
this
guided
sleep
meditation
that
will
take
you
on
a
journey
to
your
inner
child
as
you
encounter
the
child
within
you
'll
be
guided
into
developing
a
more
loving
freeing
and
forgiving
relationship
with
this
aspect
of
self
then
you
may
previously
have
had
my
name

Jason
Stephenson
and
thank
you
for
joining
me
tonight
allow
your
heart
to
open
to
this
transformative
process
as
you
develop
perhaps
a
new
or
reimagined
way
of
relating
to
that
child
within
so
to
begin
take
your
time
to
find
a
comfortable
resting
position
where
you
can
settle
in
for
the
night
ahead
[
Music

ensure
that
your
spine
is
as
straight
as
possible
they
're
still
relaxed
and
allow
your
limbs
to
rest
comfortably
and
naturally
with
your
eyes
closed
take
a
few
moments
to
reconnect
with
your
breath
simply
notice
the
way
it
waxes
and
wanes
through
the
body
soften
your

[

you
're
turning
your
jaw
and
your
belly
as
you
settle
deeper
into
the
space
that
holds
you
[
Music

and
see
if
you
might
allow
the
stomach
to
rise
and
fall
to
its
fullest
capacity
with
each
breath
with
each
in-breath
the
belly
extends
with
ease
and
with
each
breath
out
it
gently
falls
back
down
[
Music
]
extending
with
ease
as
it
feels
and
falling
gently
as
it
empties
now
before
we
take
a
journey
to
meet
the
inner
child
let
us
ground
ourselves
in
compassion
patience
and
care
each
one
of
us
has
a
unique
relationship
to
our
inner
child
and
sometimes
it
is
a
challenging
one
for
this
reason
it
is
important
that
we
establish
ourselves
in
love
before
moving
further
so
take
a
moment
now
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
heart
space
watching
as
the
breath
flows
into
and
out
of
this
loving
center
of
your
body
you
might
imagine
that
each
inhalation
feeds
your
inner
capacity
for
love
and
that
each
breath
out
softens
any
resistance
to
self-love
and
care
and
as
you
breathe
through
the
heart
take
a
few
moments
to
reaffirm
the
following
sentiments
that
will
support
you
on
your
journey
I
am
patient
and
gentle
with
myself
[
Music
]
I
care
for
and
embrace
my
innermost
self
I
support
myself
unconditionally
I
am
grounded
in
love
and
compassion
let
these
words
dissipate
into
the
background
as
you
sink
into
this
energy
of
loving-kindness
continue
to
mind
the
breath
remembering
that
each
inhalation
fuels
you
and
that
each
exhalation
frees
you
of
what
is
no
longer
required
and
as
we
move
through
this
journey
know
that
your
experience
will
be
as
unique
as
you
and
your
inner
child
are
for
some
this
process
might
be
difficult
know
that
as
you
move
through
this
you
are
always
encouraged
to
follow
your
own
inner
guidance
so
be
sure
to
do
whatever
you
need
to
do
to
support
yourself
just
allow
my
words
to
guide
you
and
remember
that
you
can
always
come
back
to
the
breath
to
ground
you
[

before
we
move
into
this
visualization
let
's
take
three
deep
cleansing
breaths
together
begin
by
letting
your
last
inhalation
leave
the
body
completely
and
then
take
a
deep
full
breath
in
for
the
count
of
four
and

exhale
for
a
count

six
another
deep

exhale
for

one
last
breath
in
for
four
and
let
it
back
out
for

to
come
back
to
its

sink
into

surface

your
breath
as
an
anchor
whenever
you
need
it
to
tether
you
back
into
this
present
moment

let
all
unnecessary
tension
slowly
begin
to
dissolve
into
the
space
that
supports

yourself
to
be
held
here
unconditionally
to
begin
this
visual
journey
turn
your
attention
towards
your
mind

yourself
standing
in

deep
lush
evergreen
forest
your
feet
are
firmly
rooted
in

that
weaves
through

around

up
into

clear
blue
sky

your
spine
is
straight
your

do
so
deeply
welcoming
the
cleansing
pine

air
into
the
depths
of
your
lungs
you
exhale
with
a
soft
sigh
letting
go
of
anything
that

you
here

three
full

at

crisp
and
clean

cleanse

soul
you

ahead

enchanted
forest

holds
you

air
is
a
comfortable
temperature
keeping
you
both
warm
and
refreshed
observe
the
colors
and
textures
that
fill
your
eyesight
as
you
pass
through
this

what
shapes
do
the

hues
appear
in
the

the
trunks
of
the
trees

any

that
thrives
here
[

what
richness

diversity
is
apparent
to
you
[

the
further
you
venture
the
more
settled
you
feel
this
flourishing
ecosystem
holds
you
as
one
of
its
own
leading
you
gently
onwards
down
your
own
path
of
healing
it
's
not
long
before
there
is
a
break
in
the
trees
and
you
step
out
of
the
woods
upon
the
site
of
a
magnificent
shimmering
lake
your
shoulders
drop
even
further
from
your
ears

your
soul
is
stirred
by
this
body
of
water
you
approach
the
water

edge
slowly
inching
your
way
towards
the
rocky
shoreline
that
surrounds
it
the
still
water
loves
you
right
up
to
its
edge
and
so
you
take
a
seat
on
the
smooth
rock

overlooking
the
water
to
rest
for

its
way
towards

fading
day
the

is
barely
traceable
and
the
flat
water
sparkles
beneath
the
Setting

all
is
well
as
you
gaze
across
the
water
you
realize
you
feel
deeply
content
in
this
space
and
time
there
is
nothing
missing
from
this
moment
and
yet
your
heart
is
wide
open
to
whatever
might
come
your
way
you
feel
strong
stable
and
secure
in
who
and

you
are

something
draws
your

down
the
shore

leads
into

distance
away

young
person
perhaps
five

six
years
of
age
though
their
exact
age
is
entirely
up
to
you
this
individual
slowly
makes
their
way
closer
and
closer
to
you
until
soon
you
realize
that
the
person
approaching
is
you
it
is
you
from
some
many
years
ago
it
is
the
child
within
the
child
that
has
always
kept
some
space
within
you
[
Music

they
're
returning
to
you
and
you
to
them
[

take
a
moment
to
fully
notice
this
child

your

be
completely
open
to
their
presence
regardless
of
how
they
've
shown
up
today

this
child
moves
carefully
and
as
they
come
within
a
few
meters
distance
you
offer
a
few
words
of
kindness
and
invite
them
to
come
and
sit
next
to
you
knowing
they
're
safe
in
this
visualization
they
come
to
take
a
seat
in
front
of
you
you
begin
this
interaction
simply
by
extending
the
warmth
of
your
heart
onto
this
small
person
before
you
grounded
in
a
wisdom
and
self
compassion
that
they
have
yet
to
develop

hold
this
energy
for
them

through
your

offer
them
your
unconditional
acceptance

meeting
their
eyes
you
take
in

heart

child

you
ask
them
if
there
is
anything
on
their
heart
or
mind
[

leave
plenty
of
space
for
what
arises
and
if
or
as
they
speak
listen
without
judgment
simply
hold
space

whatever
it
is
they
are
feeling
know
also
that
it
is
okay
if
they
do
not
have
any
words
to
say
your
inner
child
may
speak
through
nonverbal
language
and
in
the
face
of
whatever
arises
whether
that
be
fear
joy
anger
grief
guilt
playfulness
or
anything
else
you
offer
them
your
love
you
offer
this
child
your
compassion
without
expectation
and
without
condition

yourself
be
there

as
steady
as
the
physical
rock
beneath
you
you
nurture
them
in
whatever
way
feels

for
the
two
of
you
perhaps
that
is

know
that
they
have
your
unconditional
support
in
releasing
anything
that
does
not
serve
their
sense

happiness
and
wholeness
you
as
their
wise
elder
can
offer
them
the
love

and
forgiveness
that
they've
been
yearning
for
[

and
now
in
the
silent
space
that
holds
you
both
next
to

through

through

hug

be
held
by
your

by
your
strength

this
child
take
the
time
they
need
to
feel
as
they
feel
reminding
them
that
you
are
not
here
to
change
them
you
are
simply
here
to
listen
and
to
support
[

and
as
they
feel
heard
the
inner
world
begins
to
quiet
as
does
your
own
soon
the
two
of
you
sit
peacefully
and
contently
gazing
out
over
the
calm
waters
of
the
lake
at
dusk
[
Music
]
The
Sun
has
disappeared
behind
the
trees
and
a
warm
orange
glow
stretches
across
the
horizon
the
sky
above
is
ocean
blue
slowly
deepening
its
turn
as
the
day
fades
away
you
and
your
inner
child
look
towards
one
another
and
smile
you
were
grateful
for
this
moment
and
for
this
opportunity
to
reconnect
[
Music

you
and
as
the
colors
of
the
sky
signal
that
it
is
almost
time
for
slumber
you
ask
your
inner
child
where
they
like
to
rest
for
the
night
perhaps
they
yearn
to
go
to
bed
in
a
place
from
your
shared
past
perhaps
they
longed
to
slumber
beneath
the
open
starry
sky
or
perhaps
they
would
find
the
most
peace
the
most
happiness
falling
asleep
in
some
imagined
land
that
inspires
them
wherever
your
inner
child
finds
peace
and
comfort
let
them
know
you
will
guide
them
there
[
Music

and
then
slowly
slowly
letting
the
landscape
in
your
mind
transform
call
to
mind
the
place
where
they
know
they
will
rest
with
the
most
ease
[
Music
]
imagine
what
this
place
looks
like
and
what
comforts
it
holds
wherever
you
find
yourself
invite
your
inner
child
to
settle
into
a
cozy
and
comfortable
bed
for
the
night
you
tuck
them
in
with
love
and
care
reminding
them
that
you
are
always
here
for
them
and
as
they
surrender
into
the
night
you
whisper
the
words
I
love
you
I
am
here
for
you
I
love
you
I
am
here
for
you
I
[

love
you
[
Music

I
am
here
for
you
[

spend
a
few
more
silent
moments
whispering
these
words
to
your
inner
child
perhaps
aligning
the
words
I
love
you
with
your
inhalations
and
I
'm
here
for
you
with
your
exhalations
the
inner
child
drifts
off
to
sleep
and
you
are
left
with
the
revitalized
sense
of
love
and
care
for
this
part
of
yourself
you
set
an
intention
now
that
when
the
signs
of
this
inner
child
arise
in
you
in
the
future
you
will
tend
to
them
with
unconditional
patience
presence
love
and
compassion
[
Music
]
now
you
two
are
ready
to
surrender
into
sleep
and
so
you
come
back
to
your
body
letting
the
evenings
visualizations
gently
begin
to
dissipate
[
Music
]
notice
the
felt
sense
of
your
body
being
supported
by
the
bed
or
other
surface
beneath
you
what
does
it
feel
like
to
be
held
here
[
Music
]
notice
the
breath
as
it
flows
through
you
creating
an
expansion
and
a
softening
with
each
full
cycle
and
then
draw
your
attention
to
the
heart
space
once
again
connecting
with
the
center
of
your
compassion
for
one
last
time
before
drifting
into
sleep
[
Music
]
and
as
you
hold
your
attention
here
imagine
a
small
white
light
beginning
to
appear
in
the
center
of
your
chest
it
expands
outwards
with
each
second
that
goes
by
and
as
it
permeates
through
your
body
it
offers
its
a
loving
energy
to
each
cell
that
it
passes
[
Music
]
soon
your
entire
body
is
held
in
this
healing
white
light
arising
from
within
it
nurtures
every
part
of
you
the
present
self
the
past
self
and
the
future
self
all
at
the
same

spend
just
a
few
more
moments
now
feeling
yourself
as
you
were
bathed
in
this
warm
glow
[
Music
]
and
when
you
were
ready
slowly
let
that
light
dissipate
come
back
to
the
felt
sense
of
your
body
in
this
space
let
yourself
connect
intimately
with
the
earth
that
supports
you
here
and
then
let
your
attention
come
back
to
the
breath
noting
this
natural
movement
as
it
passes
through
you
if
there
is
anything
else
that
needs
to
be
released
let
it
out
now
with
a
deep
sigh
[
Music

allow
your
breath
to
be
an
anchor
for
your
awareness
as
you
slowly
drift
into
slumber
sleep
well
my
friend

well

youhello
this
is
Sara
Raymond
with
the
mindful
movement
welcome
to
this
guided
sleep
meditation
to
help
you
prepare
for
a
deep
and
relaxing
night
's
sleep
we
will
also
focus
on
inviting
in
abundance
to
your
life
first
I
will
guide
you
through
a
complete
body
and
mind
relaxation
that
will
bring
about
a
sense
of
calmness
and
allow
your
subconscious
mind
to
let
go
of
anything
blocking
the
flow
of
abundance
to
you
then
you
will
hear
suggestions
to
invite
abundance
into
your
life
in
any
way
that
you
desire
the
mindset
of
abundance
is
the
opposite
of
scarcity
abundance
is
the
overflowing
and
over
sufficient
quantity
of
that
which
you
desire
and
you
have
the
power
to
invite
it
into
your
life
what
you
are
thinking
about
right
before
you
fall
asleep
will
set
the
tone
for
the
quality
of
your
sleep
and
your
mindset
for
the
next
day
you
have
the
choice
to
change
the
way
that
you
look
at
things
before
we
get
started
make
sure
you
are
ready
to
drift
off
to
sleep
if
you
like
when
this
recording
is
over
if
you
like
the
relaxing
benefits
of
lavender
oil
and
happen
to
have
some
you
can
rub
some
on
your
temples
or
your
pulse
points
or
perhaps
diffuse
it
into
the
air
or
spray
a
light
mist
on
your
pillow
make
your
environment
as
dark
and
relaxing
as
possible
take
a
moment
now
to
turn
off
all
distractions
and
pause
this
recording
if
there
's
anything
you
need
to
prepare
yourself
for
a
safe
and
comfortable
night
's
sleep
know
that
you
are
safe
and
supported
and
you
can
awake
from
the
state
of
relaxation
at
any
time
if
you
choose
to
do
so
now
that
you
have
prepared
your
surroundings
welcome
a
sense
of
relaxation
and
peace
into
your
mind
and
body
invite
it
in
as
if
you
are
welcoming
an
old
friend
as
we
begin
allow
your
eyes
to
close
gently
and
focus
your
attention
on
your
breath
by
simply
being
mindful
and
intentional
with
your
breath
your
body
sends
a
signal
to
your
brain
that
you
are
safe
and
can
move
into
rest
and
digest
mode
now
begin
to
deepen
your
breath
take
a
full
breath
in
to
fill
up
from
your
belly
up
to
your
ribs
and
into
your
chest
and
hold
your
breath
for
just
a
moment
[
Music
]
and
let
out
your
breath
gently
allowing
any
physical
and
emotional
tension
to
leave
your
body
with
your
exhale
again
take
another
deep
breath
hold
it
for
a
short
moment
and
this
time
take
your
time
with
the
exhale
slowing
it
down
so
that
it
lasts
just
a
little
longer
than
the
inhale
take
the
next
few
moments
to
mindfully
breathe
in
this
way
encouraging
each
exhale
to
be
just
a
bit
longer
than
the
inhale
to
signal
the
body
to
relax
each
breath
cycle
allow
the
exhale
to
slow
down
a
little
more
than
the
breath
before
it
and
feel
your
body
soften
and
your
thoughts
slow
down
even
more
with
each
slow
deep
breath
now
release
that
breath
pattern
and
allow
your
breath
to
return
to
its
natural
rhythm
and
flow
notice
how
you
were
feeling
while
you
're
short
and
focused
breath
practice
has
slowed
your
heart
rate
it
has
quieted
your
mind
it
has
brought
about
a
heavy
sense
of
calm
to
your
physical
body
[
Music
]
notice
the
natural
rhythm
of
your
breath
and
feel
the
sensations
that
accompany
your
breath
perhaps
you
feel
a
slightly
cool
sensation
as
the
air
passes
through
your
nostrils
maybe
you
feel
a
floating
sensation
as
your
abdomen
and
chest
rise
and
fill
with
breath
or
a
heaviness
as
the
air
moves
out
of
your
body
taking
any
tension
with
it
maybe
the
breath
brings
a
warming
sensation
to
the
body
as
it
travels
along
its
path
whatever
you
're
feeling
is
perfect
simply
observe
the
process
this
process
of
relaxation
is
not
about
what
you
are
feeling
but
that
you
are
being
curious
and
looking
[
Music
]
as
you
continue
to
attend
to
the
sensations
in
the
body
associated
with
your
breath
let
go
of
distractions
let
go
of
your
responsibilities
let
go
of
expectations
of
what
you
think
this
experience
should
be
and
surrender
to
the
process
of
relaxation
simply
notice
what
you
are
feeling
without
changing
or
judging
just
notice
invite
in
the
feeling
of
peace
as
you
tune
out
the
whole
world
around
you
and
go
within
with
my
voice
as
a
soothing
guide
to
help
you
move
towards
sleep
in
a
moment
now
I
will
guide
you
to
slowly
scan
your
entire
body
starting
from
the
top
of
your
head
moving
all
the
way
down
through
your
feet
as
I
say
each
part
of
your
body
see
that
part
in
your
mind
's
eye
and
you
can
relax
that
body
part
completely
[
Music
]
welcome
the
sense
of
ease
through
your
entire
body
and
mind
encourage
the
weight
of
your
body
to
be
completely
supported
by
the
surface
below
you
so
that
there
is
no
need
to
hold
on
you
can
simply
let
go
into
sleep
there
is
no
need
to
follow
my
voice
for
the
entire
recording
your
subconscious
mind
will
hear
me
as
you
drift
into
sleep
now
as
we
begin
to
scan
the
body
bring
your
attention
to
the
top
of
your
head
intend
to
feel
this
area
from
the
inside
of
your
body
as
sensations
only
without
moving
your
eyes
as
you
scan
your
body
simply
move
your
awareness
to
each
part
and
you
will
relax
that
body
part
completely
let
's
begin
this
relaxation
process
with
the
scalp
welcoming
ease
into
the
forehead
and
eyes
allow
the
release
of
any
facial
expression
to
soften
the
lines
of
your
face
relax
the
tiny
muscles
around
your
eyes
and
feel
as
your
eyelids
become
heavy
allow
your
cheeks
to
soften
your
jaw
to
unclench
and
your
neck
to
relax
completely
as
each
muscle
relaxants
in
progression
it
invites
a
deeper
sense
of
relaxation
to
the
parts
of
your
body
that
came
before
in
our
body
scan
continuing
this
cumulative
relaxation
process
as
you
invite
a
sense
of
peace
and
stillness
to
your
shoulders
chest
and
arms
perhaps
feeling
a
relaxed
heaviness
move
into
your
ribs
abdomen
and
back
let
go
of
any
gripping
in
your
hips
as
your
thighs
rest
heavy
on
the
surface
below
you
as
if
there
is
no
difference
between
where
you
end
and
where
the
surface
below
you
begins
you
may
find
that
the
simple
act
of
paying
attention
to
a
specific
body
part
allows
it
to
relax
and
let
go
finally
since
your
ankles
and
feet
releasing
and
relaxing
completely
[
Music
]
take
another
moment
to
slowly
scan
your
body
once
more
this
time
notice
any
areas
that
may
still
be
holding
on
to
any
lingering
tension
and
ask
your
body
to
let
go
simply
let
go
of
the
need
to
be
in
control
and
surrender
to
the
support
of
the
surface
below
you
your
body
is
safe
and
supported
and
knows
exactly
what
to
do
to
relax
if
you
simply
allow
the
tension
to
release
now
they
were
fully
relaxed
I
will
guide
you
on
a
journey
this
journey
will
take
you
on
a
path
to
release
any
negative
beliefs
or
ideas
that
could
be
holding
you
back
from
the
abundance
you
desire
then
you
will
bring
in
the
energy
of
abundance
into
the
space
you
create
for
it
when
you
let
go
of
fears
I
invite
you
to
open
your
imagination
and
step
into
a
field
of
beautiful
wildflowers
look
around
at
this
field
of
wildflowers
as
you
stand
on
a
path
that
leads
you
right
down
the
center
of
the
field
here
you
are
surrounded
on
both
sides
by
flowers
and
the
most
vivid
colors
use
your
senses
to
take
in
this
beautiful
and
peaceful
environment
around
you
see
the
clear
bright
sky
above
you
feel
that
the
temperature
of
the
air
is
perfect
just
for
you
and
the
Sun
shines
on
you
gently
warming
your
skin
the
faint
smell
of
the
flowers
is
just
right
for
your
liking
perhaps
you
hear
birds
chirping
in
the
distance
or
see
butterflies
flitting
around
as
you
look
around
you
can
see
many
beautiful
colors
in
all
directions
around
you
you
sense
that
you
are
safe
and
peaceful
in
this
place
in
your
imagination
that
is
just
right
for
you
[
Music
]
you
begin
to
walk
along
this
path
down
the
center
of
the
field
moving
towards
some
rolling
hills
where
you
see
even
more
wildflowers
as
you
walk
you
have
a
feeling
that
you
are
carrying
around
something
extra
something
weighing
you
down
something
making
you
feel
heavy
and
tired
you
reach
into
your
pockets
and
feel
that
surprisingly
there
are
some
smooth
stones
there
these
stones
that
you
are
carrying
around
weighing
you
down
[
Music
]
represent
your
fears
and
your
feelings
of
not
enough
they
represent
anything
known
or
unknown
to
you
that
is
holding
you
back
each
stone
is
something
that
is
blocking
the
flow
of
abundance
to
you
slowly
take
one
stone
out
of
your
pocket
and
leave
it
on
the
path
behind
you
as
you
continue
walking
forwards
feel
that
a
space
has
opened
up
inside
of
you
as
you
let
go
of
something
negative
in
your
life
there
's
no
need
to
label
what
you
are
letting
go
of
simply
let
go
knowing
that
it
's
something
that
no
longer
serves
you
or
support
your
goals
and
desires
for
abundance
continue
to
do
the
same
with
each
of
the
remaining
stones
in
your
pocket
one
at
a
time
take
your
time
and
feel
the
energetic
shift
from
negative
to
positive
feel
the
space
you
have
opened
up
for
the
flow
of
abundance
now
that
you
have
let
go
of
that
which
no
longer
serves
you
you
have
made
room
for
the
flow
of
abundance
invited
in
letting
go
of
resistance
gives
way
to
an
attitude
of
allowing
allow
in
positive
energy
thoughts
and
beliefs
allow
in
gratitude
love
and
abundance
feel
this
flow
of
positive
energy
within
you
and
it
is
magnetically
attracted
back
to
you
take
a
moment
and
sense
this
energy
and
positive
feeling
[
Music
]
as
you
look
around
at
the
field
of
flowers
now
you
can
see
possibilities
and
abundance
everywhere
you
look
each
of
the
flowers
around
you
grow
from
a
seed
each
seed
had
everything
it
needed
within
it
to
become
the
flower
that
it
is
and
each
flower
has
the
seeds
to
become
many
more
flowers
and
on
and
on
the
cycle
goes
much
like
these
flowers
grown
from
seeds
you
to
have
everything
you
need
within
you
to
have
the
life
of
your
dreams
and
to
attract
the
abundance
in
your
life
that
you
desire
the
abundance
of
the
flowers
around
you
represents
abundance
in
your
life
now
call
to
mind
a
part
of
your
life
that
you
would
like
to
see
a
flow
of
abundance
visualize
this
component
of
your
life
exactly
as
you
want
it
to
be
feel
how
it
would
feel
as
if
this
was
already
true
for
you
soak
in
the
feelings
in
this
present
moment
the
things
you
think
about
right
before
drifting
off
to
sleep
color
your
thoughts
as
you
sleep
and
for
the
day
ahead
in
a
moment
I
will
guide
your
subconscious
with
some
positive
affirmation
statements
inviting
the
flow
of
abundance
into
your
life
there
is
no
need
to
repeat
these
if
you
are
so
relaxed
you
are
almost
sleeping
your
subconscious
will
hear
them
simply
believe
they
are
true
I
acknowledge
the
positive
things
in
my
life
I
expressed
the
feeling
of
gratitude
often
for
the
blessings
in
my
life
I
love
myself
and
believe
I
am
worthy
of
abundance
to
flow
to
me
I
allow
the
flow
of
abundance
in
all
aspects
of
my
life
I
attract
success
and
abundance
I
radiate
out
positive
loving
energy
and
that
is
what
comes
back
to
me
I
take
action
towards
my
goals
of
abundance
every
day
I
let
go
of
negative
influences
and
energies
that
do
not
serve
me
I
know
that
abundance
is
unlimited
and
that
my
abundance
will
benefit
others
I
am
generous
and
give
my
unique
gifts
to
the
world
and
now
you
have
prepared
your
mind
in
your
body
for
a
deep
and
restful
night's
sleep
your
subconscious
mind
is
open
to
allow
the
flow
of
abundance
to
you
you
're
a
relaxed
and
feel
a
sense
of
lightness
and
spaciousness
as
you
have
let
go
of
anything
weighing
you
down
sleep
is
inviting
you
to
let
go
and
surrender
to
your
dreams
allow
this
to
happen
if
you
wish
take
the
final
steps
into
a
deep
and
restful
slumber
as
you
drift
off
into
a
dreaming
sleep
you
will
continue
to
radiate
out
love
and
positive
energy
and
attract
it
back
to
you
your
body
knows
exactly
what
to
do
to

during
your
very

deep
sleep
as
you
drift
off
into
serene
peaceful
rest
my
voice
will
gradually
disappear
and
you
will
be
deeply
asleep
and
when
you
awake
hours
later
you
will
feel
energized
rejuvenated
and
you
will
be
open
to
allow
the
flow

youwelcome
this
guided
meditation
is
to
help
you
sue
the
feelings
of
anxiety
before
bed
so
that
you
can
fall
asleep
easily
and
have
a
peaceful
night
's
sleep
meditation
before
bed
is
a
wonderful
way
to
quiet
the
racing
thoughts
and
to
get
ready
for
the
day
or
week
ahead
please
do
not
use
this
as
a
substitute
for
seeking
the
advice
of
a
medical
professional
if
necessary
the
mind
is
a
complex
process
sometimes
we
find
ourselves
overwhelmed
by
where
our
mind
can
take
us
ideally
as
we
become
more
self-aware
through
our
practice
we
learn
how
to
use
our
mind
as
a
tool
many
of
us
have
difficulty
with
this
concept
or
have
not
yet
begun
that
path
when
our
mind
uses
us
instead
it
can
lead
us
in
various
directions
when
this
happens
we
are
subject
to
the
reactions
we
may
have
to
our
thoughts
and
our
life
situations
this
is
often
what
triggers
feelings
of
anxiety
when
our
mind
takes
us
to
future
moments
we
can
feel
worried
or
even
panic
over
what
's
to
come
anxiety
is
on
some
level
living
in
the
future
nothing
ever
happens
in
the
future
though
everything
happens
in
the
present
moment
getting
in
touch
with
the
present
moment
and
the
timeless
beauty
of
the
now
and
accepting
it
fully
with
love
and
non
judgment
that
is
where
the
answer
to
anxiety
lies
many
people
deal
with
feelings
of
anxiety
on
a
regular
basis
understanding
some
of
the
details
on
a
basic
level
can
help
set
your
path
towards
an
anxiety
free
life
first
of
all
anxiety
can
not
hurt
you
even
though
it
might
feel
otherwise
in
the
moment
it
is
important
to
recognize
this
it
is
basically
a
shift
in
activity
in
the
brain
from
one
area
to
another
it
may
create
physical
symptoms
that
appear
at
times
quite
severe
it
can
even
replicate
feeling
similar
to
a
real
physical
concern
being
able
to
recognize
these
feelings
for
what
they
are
just
a
temporary
shift
towards
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
also
known
as
the
fight-or-flight
response
is
a
powerful
step
towards
healing
[
Music
]
once
we
understand
and
truly
believe
that
these
feelings
no
matter
how
powerful
can
do
us
no
harm
we
can
accept
them
without
judgment
in
fact
as
an
observer
of
our
bodies
we
want
to
welcome
these
feelings
oftentimes
it
's
the
fear
of
anxiety
that
triggers
further
anxious
sensations
if
we
truly
do
not
fear
them
they
will
begin
to
dissolve
welcome
them
as
The
Watcher
of
your
body
as
if
you
are
expecting
these
feelings
see
these
feelings
as
a
teaching
tool
as
though
you
are
completely
okay
with
them
smile
at
them
smile
with
every
cell
in
your
body
and
as
your
love
shines
its
light
the
darkness
will
fade
oftentimes
this
anxiety
creeps
up
around
bedtime
when
we
begin
to
consider
what's
in
store
for
the
next
day
or
the
week
ahead
it
is
the
idea
of
living
in
the
future
today
I
will
invite
you
into
your
present
moment
to
let
go
of
the
past
and
have
confidence
in
what
the
future
holds
I
will
guide
you
to
attend
to
your
breath
and
your
physical
sensations
in
this
present
moment
with
this
practice
you
can
peacefully
drift
off
to
sleep
take
a
moment
and
make
sure
you
are
in
a
safe
place
to
drift
off
to
sleep
if
you
choose
if
you
need
to
pause
this
video
that
's
okay
[
Music

make
sure
your
room
is
dark
and
you
are
very
comfortable
if
you
are
listening
to
this
on
an
electronic
device
turn
the
screens
light
away
from
you
create
the
most
comfortable
environment
that
you
can
[
Music
]
once
you
are
ready
to
begin
the
journey
to
sleep
bring
your
attention
to
your
breath
and
invite
the
feeling
of
settling
into
your
space
knowing
you
are
exactly
where
you
need
to
be
I
'm
going
to
count
to
three
and
then
I
would
like
you
to
take
a
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
and
as
you
exhale
gently
close
your
eyes
and
soften
your
body
one
two
three
[
Music

let
's
repeat
that
cycle
two
more
times
gently
open
your
eyes
one
two
three
breathe
in
deeply
and
relax
on
your
exhale
letting
your
eyes
close
one
more
time
softly
open
your
eyes
one
two
three
breathe
in
deep
and
relax
letting
your
eyes
shut
down
and
your
whole
body
relaxed
and
with
your
eyes
closed
now
allow
your
breath
to
become
natural
[
Music
]
knowing
that
the
body
knows
what
to
do
to
breathe
to
relax
and
to
recover
and
rejuvenate
while
you
sleep
and
now
simply
be
aware
of
the
sensations
in
your
body
that
are
associated
with
the
natural
rhythm
of
your
breath
[
Music
]
notice
the
cool
air
of
the
passes
into
your
nostrils
and
how
the
air
is
a
little
warmer
as
it
flows
out
of
your
body
feel
as
the
chest
and
belly
rise
and
fall
and
rhythm
with
the
breath
[
Music
]
as
you
continue
breathing
naturally
begin
to
sense
the
pause
that
occurs
between
the
exhale
and
the
next
inhale
keep
your
attention
on
this
momentary
pause
for
the
next
few
breaths
using
this
pause
to
come
back
to
each
present
moment
use
this
pause
to
let
go
of
the
worry
about
the
future
to
let
go
of
the
need
for
perfection
to
let
go
of
the
shoulds
[
Music
]
if
your
attention
drifts
away
from
your
breath
which
it
likely
will
noticing
a
sound
or
a
thought
or
a
physical
sensation
lovingly
return
your
attention
to
the
next
breath
and
the
next
pause
continue
focusing
on
your
breath
as
you
invite
your
body
to
soften
and
reacts
each
natural
exhale
takes
you
deeper
into
relaxation
and
closer
to
peaceful
sleep
allow
yourself
to
let
go
of
all
the
stress
from
your
day
let
go
of
your
to-do
list
for
the
future
and
now
gently
move
your
attention
to
your
body
first
focus
your
attention
on
your
face
as
you
exhale
let
go
of
all
the
muscles
of
your
face
[
Music

relax
your
forehead
relax
the
tiny
muscles
around
your
eyes
and
your
cheeks
unclench
your
jaw
and
think
into
the
surface
below
you
continue
to
watch
your
breath
as
you
let
go
of
the
muscles
in
your
neck
and
your
shoulders
[
Music

relax
your
arms
relax
your
back
[

let
go

muscles
in

let
go

in

invite
the

feeling
very

are
enjoying
a

slowly
complete
one
more

of
your
body
sensations
from
your

all
the
way
down
throughout
your

[
Music

inviting
your

to
go
deeper
into
relaxation
you
now
I
would
like
you
to
imagine
watching
yourself
as
an
observer
outside
of
your
own
body
imagine
yourself
in
a
place
where
you
have
known
to
have
the
sense
of
anxiety
in
the
past
maybe
it
's
at
work
or
at
home
or
possibly
in
a
social
situation
I
would
like
you
to
see
yourself
going
through
your
day
when
you
begin
to
notice
these
unwanted
feelings
coming
on
as
the
observer
notice
that
you
are
not
these
feelings
one
moment
you
can
see
yourself
happy
and
content
then
you
can
see
yourself
noticing
these
sensations
bubbling
up
from
inside
it
's
okay
these
anxious
feelings
are
there
but
everything
is
okay

to
watch
yourself
and

feelings
can
be
your
teacher

to
grow
and

few
moments
to
mindfully
breathe
in
this
way
encouraging

more

you
may
find
that
the
simple
act

to
a
body
part
allows
it
to
relax
and

go

be
in
control
and
surrender
to
the
support
of
the
surface
below
you
your
body
is
safe
and
supported
and
knows
what
to
do
to
relax
if
you
simply
allow
the
tension
to
release
[
Music

when
your
body
is
relaxed
there
is
space
for
dreams
and
possibilities
to
arise
you
can
more
easily
connect
with
your
authentic
self
and
your
true
desires
[
Music
]
as
you
continue
to
relax
I
will
guide
you
through
a
manifesting
visualization
this
practice
is
not
about
perfection
or
about
reaching
completion
this
is
the
planting
of
seeds
and
shifting
of
mindset
towards
the
belief
that
you
deserve
that
which
you
desire
this
is
about
experiencing
faith
while
things
may
not
feel
aligned
with
the
life
of
your
dreams
just
yet
that
's
okay
[
Music
]
simply
work
with
what
you
have
and
begin
to
move
towards
what
you
want
you
can't
change
the
past
so
be
careful
not
to
dwell
there
or
attach
expectations
based
on
the
past
as
you
imagine
the
outcome
of
your
manifestation
you
may
see
vivid
pictures
in
your
mind
or
you
may
find
emotions
arising
within
you
you
may
have
specific
answers
to
some
questions
or
they
may
come
later
connect
with
everything
that
is
coming
up
for
you
today
and
open
your
awareness
to
the
possibilities
as
they
arise
in
the
future
now
remaining
relaxed
and
grounded
begin
to
think
about
what
it
is
that
you
want
[
Music

see
it
in
vivid
detail
if
possible
as
if
you
are
watching
a
movie
or
perhaps
here
what
you
want
in
your
head
as
if
it
is
a
story
being
told
imagine
this
as
if
it
is
true
for
you
right
now
feel
it
in
your
body
as
truth
experience
as
much
detail
as
is
available
to
you
right
now
[

what
feelings
and
emotions
would
you
have
more
of
in
your
life
in
this
vision
what
are
the
values
and
beliefs
that
are
important
to
you
that
will
allow
you
to
manifest
your
desires
[
Music

visualize
both
the
outcome
and
the
process
to
get
there
if
it
is
clear
without
getting
attached
to
either
[

[

these
feelings
from
your
visualization
are
already
within
you
you
can
choose
to
call
upon
the
feelings
anytime
you
can
create
any
life
you
want
your
dreams
are
within
your
grasp
when
you
choose
to
reach
connect
with
what
is
showing
up
for
you
now
breathe
it
in
remain
connected
with
the
positive
excited
state
of
this
visualization
stay
connected
with
the
building
energy
of
possibilities
for
the
future
and
at
the
same
time
become
aware
of
what
you
want
and
why
you
may
not
believe
that
you
can
have
it
be
mindful
of
this
inner
conflict
where
part
of
you
may
be
thinking
you
can
not
have
what
you
want
you
do
n't
deserve
it
or
that
it
is
impossible
do
not
fight
these
thoughts
away
accept
them
do
n't
stay
here
too
long
without
judgment
let
go
of
your
past
beliefs
that
could
be
holding
you
back
perhaps
visualize
letting
go
of
a
leaf
into
a
moving
River
see
your
limiting
beliefs
go
now
that
you
have
let
go
of
that
which
no
longer
serves
you
you
have
made
room
for
the
flow
of
energy
for
manifesting
letting
go
of
resistance
gives
way
to
an
attitude
of
allowing

in
positive

thoughts
and
beliefs
allow
in
gratitude
love
and

feel
this
flow

energy
within

magnetically
attracted
back

take
a

sense
this

positive
feeling
now
consider
and
accept
all
the
positive

why
you
do
deserve
what

it
is
important
to
acknowledge
both
the
good
and
the
bad
although
you
will
make
sure
you
have
accepted
all
the
positives
and
the

go
of
the
negatives
and
focus
on
the

here
for
a

think
of
this
as
watering
the
flowers
rather
than
the

we
can
manifest

on
what
we
believe
in
and
what
we
have
faith
can
happen
in
a

I
will
guide
your

with
some
positive
statements
inviting
the
flow
of
abundance
into
your

there
is
no
need
to
repeat
these
if
you
are
so
relaxed
you
are
almost
sleeping
your
subconscious
will
hear
them
simply
believe
they
are
true

as
a
positive

where
good

open

see
as
your
ceiling
begins
to
slowly
open
right
above
your

that
it
begins
to
reveal
the
open
night
sky
directly
above

moving
through
the

hello
and
welcome
to
this
guided
sleep
meditation
that
will
focus
on
inner
clearing
forgiveness
and
the
Hawaiian
prayer
our
pono
pono
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
I
invite
you
to
gently
open
your
heart
as
you
move
with
me
through
this
deeply
healing
and
restorative
practice
and
closing
your
eyes
if
you
've
not
done
so
then
explore
what
it
feels
like
to
fully
arrive
here
and
to
arrive
in
this
sense
means
simply
to
let
your
mind
join
your
body
to
set
aside
for
the
time
being
any
notions
about
the
past
or
the
future
you
can
help
your
mind
to
arrive
here
by
tuning
into
the
surface
beneath
your
body
or
by
holding
your
entire
being
in
open
awareness
establishing
this
sense
of
presence
will
anchor
you
as
you
journey
through
this
practice
of
clearing
away
any
past
mistakes
wrongdoings
and
resentments
because
as
we
surrender
into
this
moment
it
becomes
more
natural
to
surrender
any
inner
workings
that
prevent
us
from
living
in
the
name
of
love
patience
forgiveness
and
understanding
now
let
your
attention
land
on
the
breaths
flow
if
it
's
not
already
there
and
simply
mind
this
natural
movement
of
lifeforce
as
you
ground
into
this
practice
for
a
few
more
moments
a
few
more
breaths
[
Music
]
let
each
inhalation
create
an
inner
expansion
and
each
exhalation
and
inner
softening
[
Music
]
the
Hawaiian
prayer
our
pono
pono
is
a
practice
of
healing
and
clearing
through
forgiveness
translated
this
term
can
be
understood
to
mean
to
make
right
or
to
correct
some
definitions
even
refer
to
it
as
a
mental
and
emotional
cleansing
during
this
practice
we
will
explore
the
power
of
forgiveness
by
first
easing
the
physical
body
and
then
moving
into
a
guided
visualization
for
a
deeper
level
of
mental
and
emotional
clearing
we
will
finish
this
practice
with
a
repeated
ho'oponopono
mantra
as
you
gently
surrender
into
a
good
night
's
sleep
so
I
invite
you
now
to
take
a
moment
to
come
back
to
the
physical
body
simply
noting
what
it
is
like
to
be
in
the
present
space
that
you
occupy
and
as
you
are
guided
through
the
physical
body
I
invite
you
to
bring
your
loving
awareness
to
each
area
that
we
pass
as
you
inhale
into
each
corner
of
the
body
bring
a
healing
white
light
or
a
sense
of
love
to
that
area
and
as
you
exhale
let
it
soften
into
the
present
moment
so
beginning
now
at
your
toes
holding
them
in
your
full
awareness
breathe
loving
energy
into
these
parts
of
you
sending
the
breath
all
the
way
down
and
then
exhale
to
let
any
tension
here
dissipate
and
moving
up
now
to
your
ankles
breathing
in
deeply
down
into
your
ankles
and
releasing
your
calves
and
shins
sending
the
breath
down
and
releasing
softening
moving
up
to
your
knees
breathing
in
breathing
out
your
thighs
and
your
hamstrings
[
Music
]
and
shifting
the
focus
to
your
pelvis
and
your
hips
breathing
in
and
on
the
breath
out
softening
your
belly
and
your
lower
back
[
Music
]
and
then
moving
up
to
your
spy
into
your
chest
and
your
upper
back
[
Music
]
now
draw
your
attention
to
your
fingertips
breathing
light
or
love
into
your
entire
hands
and
releasing
on
the
out-breath
continuing
with
your
wrists
your
lower
arms
your
elbows
[
Music
]
moving
up
to
your
upper
arms
breathing
in
breathing
out
and
release
and
your
shoulders
breathing
in
loving
energy
into
your
throat
area
and
soften
as
you
exhale
continue
with
your
jaw
and
your
mouth
[
Music
]
your
cheeks
ears
and
nose
you
your
third
eye
area
between
your
two
eyebrows
[
Music
]
and
then
finish
by
breathing
this
way
into
the
crown
of
your
head
hold
your
entire
body
in
your
awareness
now
for
a
few
more
grounding
breaths
before
we
move
deeper
into
this
process
of
clearing
you
might
imagine
that
your
entire
body
is
being
bathed
in
a
white
light
one
that
frees
you
of
any
inhibiting
physical
tension
and
then
gently
let
that
white
light
dissipate
in
your
own
time
now
this
will
be
a
journey
of
clearing
and
forgiveness
and
while
on
the
other
side
of
these
processes
is
deep
peace
and
love
the
journey
itself
may
be
challenging
for
some
depending
upon
how
you
find
yourself
in
this
moment
offering
yourself
or
others
forgiveness
may
cause
difficult
emotions
to
arise
if
this
turns
out
to
be
the
case
for
you
tonight
remember
that
you
can
always
come
back
to
your
breath
or
your
body
to
ground
yourself
let
your
heart
journey
as
deep
as
it
is
meant
to
be
in
this
moment
knowing
that
you
are
universally
supported
so
take
a
moment
to
find
yourself
standing
outside
of
a
home
or
cabin
that
feels
safe
comfortable
and
welcoming
to
you
it
might
be
a
home
that
you
know
or
one
that
the
mind
creates
in
either
case
observe
what
its
exterior
looks
like
what
is
it
made
of
what
is
the
surrounding
environment
like
what
about
this
abode
that
warms
the
heart
and
soul
take
a
few
moments
to
cultivate
an
image
of
this
home
in
your
mind
letting
it
bring
you
a
sense
of
safety
and
peace
[
Music
]
this
home
has
shown
up
view
today
to
serve
as
a
symbol
for
coming
home
to
yourself
it
represents
a
return
to
the
love
support
and
care
that
is
within
you
and
so
before
you
make
your
way
inside
take
a
moment
to
set
an
intention
to
love
care
for
and
support
yourself
unconditionally
and
now
as
you
reach
your
hand
for
the
door
handle
you
slowly
turn
pull
and
make
your
way
inside
standing
in
the
front
hallway
you
feel
an
immense
sense
of
relief
and
gratitude
wash
over
you
the
home
is
exactly
what
you
imagined
it
would
be
when
you
stood
outside
of
it
a
sanctuary
full
of
love
light
and
beauty
that
also
lives
at
the
very
core
of
your
being
take
a
moment
to
imagine
what
this
hallway
looks
like
what
colors
are
its
walls
what
details
and
accents
does
it
boast
what
artwork
adorns
it
now
you
slowly
walk
down
the
drifting
main
hallway
soon
arriving
in
a
living
space
that
is
warm
at
ease
and
full
of
soul
and
charm
it
contains
details
both
large
and
small
that
bring
you
a
sense
of
coming
home
to
yourself
this
room
is
a
perfect
reflection
of
who
you
are
at
your
loving
core
take
a
few
moments
now
to
paint
in
your
mind
's
eye
[
Music
]
notice
the
windows
the
light
and
the
energy
that
this
room
holds
imagine
now
that
alongside
one
wall
of
this
room
is
a
mirror
tall
and
wide
it
reflects
back
the
entire
room
into
the
onlookers
eyes
depending
upon
what
angle
it
is
approached
at
something
about
this
mirror
is
mesmerizing
and
then
you
notice
that
just
in
front
of
it
cushions
and
blankets
rest
as
if
it
's
been
waiting
for
you
slowly
and
mindfully
you
make
your
way
over
to
this
little
oasis
within
the
soulful
room
you
've
designed
taking
a
seat
upon
the
blankets
and
cushions
presented
here
you
settle
in
straightening
the
spine
as
much
as
comfortable
and
letting
the
shoulders
relaxed
your
jaw
softens
as
does
your
forehead
and
belly
and
then
you
meet
your
own
eyes
in
the
shimmering
mirror
as
you
stare
into
your
own
reflection
take
a
moment
to
simulate
a
knee
ously
hold
your
heart
in
your
awareness
let
the
loving
compassionate
energy
of
your
heart
be
the
source
of
the
healing
or
clearing
that
is
possible
here
and
as
you
hold
your
own
gaze
in
this
mirror
you
sense
that
you
are
returning
to
yourself
how
long
you
wonder
has
it
been
since
you
've
been
this
lovingly
attuned
to
your
own
inner
reflection
and
yet
while
love
is
indeed
present
here
you
might
find
that
limiting
judgements
about
who
you
are
or
where
you
've
been
come
up
to
the
surface
because
sometimes
when
we
attempt
to
love
cherish
or
accept
ourselves
the
mind
rises
with
its
whispers
of
resistance
often
these
inner
judgmental
whispers
are
subtle
and
yet
they
can
have
such
a
strong
effect
on
how
much
love
forgiveness
and
kindness
we
are
able
to
grant
ourselves
[
Music
]
so
in
order
to
clear
whatever
stories
thoughts
or
beliefs
that
may
be
holding
you
back
from
unconditional
self-acceptance
and
reconciliation
with
your
true
self
you
look
at
yourself
in
the
mirror
as
you
slowly
repeat
these
words
I
love
you
I
'm
sorry
please
forgive
me
thank
you
[
Music
]
I
love
you
I
'm
sorry
please
forgive
me
thank
you
I
love
you
I
'm
sorry
please
forgive
me
thank
you
spend
some
time
now
on
your
own
in
silence
cultivating
these
words
and
an
energy
of
deep
care
and
consideration
for
yourself
as
you
whisper
these
words
I
love
you
I
'm
sorry
please
forgive
me
and
thank
you
invisible
knots
of
resentment
judgment
and
wrongdoing
begin
to
untangle
themselves
from
your
body
your
body
becomes
lighter
your
mind
becomes
freer
and
your
heart
becomes
more

whatever
you
may
hold
against
yourself
and
whatever
you
may
have
done
in
the
past
does
not
define
who
you
really
are
beneath
the
wise
and
loving
energy
of
forgiveness
you
are
able
to
clear
yourself
you
repeat
these

three

now
the
words
dissipate
into
the
atmosphere
around
you
as
you
come
back
to
the
quiet
space
with
him
you
meet
your
reflection
in
the
mirror
once
again
feeling
a
wave
of
gratitude
washed
through
you
you
are
grateful
for
the
energies
of
love
kindness
and
forgiveness
is
showing
up
today
and
you
are
grateful
for
this
return
to
yourself
for
this
inner
reconciliation
if
you
need
some
more
time
to
connect
with
your
loving
center
imagine
yourself
resting
a
hand
upon
your
heart
and
breathing
into
that
space
each
inhalation
brings
a
wave
of
self-love
and
each
exhalation
frees
you
from
the
entanglement
of
judgment
resentment
and
the
past
you
take
one
last
look
in
the
mirror
and
then
you
turn
away
from
it
and
back
towards
the
beautiful
room
that
holds
you
and
as
you
rest
here
grounded
in
both
the
earth
and
in
your
heart
take
a
moment
to
consider
if
there
is
anyone
you
might
like
to
offer
this
loving
forgiving
and
clearing
energy
to
[
Music
]
when
you
feel
ready
to
simply
offer
to
any
individuals
or
to
the
universe
at
large
the
loving-kindness
that
has
cleared
you
here
tonight
and
when
you
were
ready
come
back
to
your
breath
and
to
the
homey
room
that
supports
you
[
Music
]
take
three
full
deep
breaths
in
your
own
timing
now
surrendering
any
residual
tension
with
a
sigh
as
needed
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
let
your
breath
resume
its
natural
rhythm
after
that
third
deep
breath
[
Music
]
and
within
the
image
of
this
inner
sanctuary
envision
yourself
coming
to
curl
up
on
the
floor
or
a
couch
within
this
room
envision
yourself
fully
supported
by
cushions
and
blankets
and
then
gently
close
your
eyes
on
even
this
visualization
as
you
come
back
to
your
body
and
to
the
reality
that
holds
you
know
that
the
energies
you
cultivated
in
this
sacred
home
are
now
embedded
within
you
as
you
drift
into
sleep
they
were
strengthened
their
roots
so
that
you
will
soon
embody
their
wisdom
in
each
and
every
cell
of
your
being
allow
your
body
to
melt
taking
a
brief
moment
to
notice
if
there
is
any
tension
that
might
like
to
be
released
or
any
adjustments
that
need
to
be
made
and
as
you
surrender
into
this
space
that
hold
you
allow
this
Hawaiian
prayer
to
continue
clearing
your
inner
world
of
that
which
no
longer
serves
you

hello
this
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
designed
to
help
you
release
what
you
've
been
holding
on
to
and
to
help
ease
you
into
a
deep
and
restorative
night
's
sleep
the
intention
behind
this
meditation
is
to
help
you
to
let
go
of
that
which
you
have
been
clinging
on
to
surrendering
it
to
a
higher
force
through
this
process
of
letting
go
you
're
free
up
misplaced
energy
finding
a
greater
sense
of
lightness
freedom
and
pure
state
of
being
this
mysterious
and
often
misunderstood
force
to
which
your
surrender
may
feel
or
sound
like
the
word
God
or
universal
energy
or
consciousness
or
it
may
be
by
some
other
name
that
is
comfortable
and
familiar
to
you
you
may
even
choose
to
leave
it
unnamed
whatever
the
case
this
idea
of
a
force
simply
points
towards
the
energy
that
makes
all
of
this
life
possible
whatever
term
or
non
term
becomes
your
guiding
force
for
this
meditation
is
entirely
welcomed
and
accepted
this
energy
will
be
the
bed
that
nourishes
you
throughout
the
duration
of
this
meditation
and
all
the
way
into
your
sleep
this
recording
is
designed
to
be
an
anchor
before
bedtime
for
a
consecutive
21
days
over
the
course
of
these
three
weeks
you
will
be
repeatedly
guided
to
let
go
of
that
which
no
longer
serves
you
allowing
the
transformative
powers
of
some
higher
force
to
nurture
hold
and
awaken
every
level
of
your
being
before
we
begin

invite
you

way
into
a
comfortable
lying
down
position

any
cushions
and
blankets
required
to
support
you
through
this
transformative
journey
and
then
into
a
deep
and
restful
sleep
make
any
adjustments
necessary
allowing
your
body
to
begin
the
process
of
relaxation
feeling
yourself
sink
a
little
bit
further
into
the
surface
that
support
you
throughout
this
journey
as
is
the
case
with
any
meditation
you
may
experience
rising
emotions
or
other
challenging
sensations
if
these
waves
come
to
you
know
that
is
safe
to
feel
into
them
allow
the
space
that
holds
you
the
air
that
surrounds
you
and
the
force
that
lives
within
you
to
carry
you
through
whatever
arises
just
surrender
these
energies
to
the
higher
power
that
supports
all
of
life
note
that
each
day
of
this
meditation
will
be
set
against
a
different
emotional
backdrop
know
that
from
day
to
day
this
meditation
will
feel
and
look
unique
as
you
process
it
in
your
own
natural
way
know
that
whatever
arises
is
entirely
okay
and
that
whatever
comes
up
is
in
fact
required
to
be
seen
in
order
for
you
to
move
through
it
and
finally
know
that
you
are
unconditionally
supported
through
this
journey
[
Music
]
take
a
moment
now
to
connect
with
your
breath
without
attempting
to
change
it
in
any
way
simply
notice
its
natural
rhythm
in
this
very
moment
[
Music
]
notice
the
way
that
without
any
action
on
your
part
the
breaths
innate
wisdom
guides
itself
into
the
body
gently
and
back
out
to
the
world
around
you
allow
your
breath
to
be
your
anchor
into
the
present
moment
throughout
this
process
of
letting
go
for
a
few
breaths
now
bring
your
awareness
to
your
belly
simply
observe
this
part
of
the
body
and
notice
that
wherever
your
attention
flows
the
breath
goes
to
witness
the
natural
rise
and
fall
of
the
stomach
with
each
inhalation
and
each
exhalation
notice
the
body
becoming
more
relaxed
with
each
deep
breath
taken
and
feel
that
sinking
further
into
this
space
that
support
you
take
a
moment
to
bring
awareness
to
the
truth
that
just
by
being
here
in
this
very
moment
you
are
already
beginning
the
process
of
releasing
by
allowing
the
body
to
rest
deeply
into
this
present
moment
you
are
immersed
within
the
journey
of
releasing
limited
notions
that
have
been
carried
for
quite
some
time
with
your
attention
turn
towards
each
breath
you
are
continuously
being
grounded
into
the
present
moment
surrendering
your
thoughts
to
that
which
exists
all
around
you
to
cosmic
energy
to
the
source
of
all
life
throughout
this
meditation
your
mind
may
become
subject
to
wondering
if
this
is
the
case
in
any
moment
simply
observe
this
tendency
of
the
mind
to
lose
its
focus
to
wander
into
the
past
or
into
the
future
and
into
deeply
entrenched
beliefs
about
yourself
or
about
life
in
general
and
know
that
this
movement
is
entirely
natural
observe
each
mental
shift
away
from
the
present
moment
with
compassion
and
non
judgment
as
humans
with
the
capacity
for
self
consciousness
it
is
entirely
natural
for
the
mind
to
wander
now
if
it
's
here
and
not
to
reject
or
deny
these
movements
but
to
simply
observe
them
and
then
to
guide
awareness
back
to
the
breath
or
some
other
anchor
to
the
present
moment
[
Music
]
with
each
mental
meandering
that
arises
simply
witness
it
and
then
guide
your
attention
back
to
your
breath
or
to
the
sound
of
my
voice
take
a
few
moments
here
to
gently
follow
the
breath
allowing
it
to
guide
you
further
into
this
present
moment
releasing
any
mental
notions
of
the
past
present
or
future
simply
allow
yourself
to
be
right
here
right
now
[
Music
]
letting
go
requires
a
complete
surrender
of
our
mental
energy
often
this
process
brings
up
uncomfortable
sensations
and
deep
feelings
of
fear
whatever
we
have
been
holding
on
to
has
become
interwoven
with
our
experience
and
expectation
of
happiness
letting
go
requires
us
to
surrender
into
the
deep
and
knowing
that
even
without
whatever
beliefs
ideas
people
or
objects
we
have
been
clinging
to
we
are
entirely
whole
entirely
loved
and
entirely
free
our
attempts
to
control
the
world
around
us
are
born
out
of
fear
fear
that
we
may
not
receive
enough
love
or
money
or
safety
or
nourishment
or
anything
else
for
that
matter
through
exerting
control
we
often
believe
that
we
can
ensure
that
our
future
will
play
out
the
way
we
hope
for
it
to
letting
go
of
this
belief
requires
a
leap
of
faith
a
leap
into
knowing
that
everything
we
require
will
be
provided
by
this
cosmic
force
greater
than
us
take
a
moment
once
again
to
tune
in
to
the
breath
acknowledging
any
sensations
feelings
or
emotions
that
may
be
rising
simply
witness
these
uprisings
if
they
present
themselves
as
passing
waves
that
do
not
belong
to
you
allow
them
to
come
and
allow
them
to
go
without
fixating
on
any
mental
ideas
about
what
they
are
why
they
are
there
or
what
their
purpose
is
simply
observe
them
without
thought
without
judgment
and
with
unconditional
acceptance
and
compassion
the
act
of
surrender
requires
what
may
feel
like
a
courageous
leap
into
the
unknown
and
yet
on
the
other
side
of
this
leap
is
the
sensation
of
freedom
by
letting
go
of
our
attempts
to
control
or
to
manipulate
the
world
around
us
we
release
vast
stores
of
energy
this
energy
does
not
disappear
from
us
but
instead
repurposes
itself
energy
that
was
once
tied
up
in
fear
becomes
energy
intertwined
with
love
trust
and
peace
take
a
moment
now
to
come
into
the
body
due
to
the
intricate
interconnection
of
mind
and
body
we
can
help
to
ease
the
mind
and
support
its
surrender
through
release
and
relaxation
of
the
body
just
continue
to
follow
my
voice
as
we
journey
now

the
body

the
tips
of
your

part
of

a
moment
now
to
observe
the
whole
body
feeling
it
melt
into
the
surface
beneath
it
and
as
the
body
relaxes
more
deeply
notice
how
the
mind
follows
take
a
few
deep
breaths
you
allowing
both
body
and
mind
to
continue
sinking
into
the
universal
energy
that
supports
them
as
you
continue
your
personal
journey
of
letting
go
know
that
you
are
deeply
supported
by
the
higher
force
that
exists
around
and
within
you
this
all-knowing
and
ever-present
energetic
force
is
a
safe
loving
and
supportive
container
capable
of
holding

transforming
all
mental
beliefs

this
divine
energy
and
its
support
can
be
called
upon

a
moment
now

be
helpful

now
to
breathe
from
the
heart

inhalation

through
the
heart
we
are
better
able
to
recognize
our
connection
to
this
oneness
that
supports
all
of
life
by
allowing
your
mind
to
descend
and
melt
away
we
begin
to
operate
from
the
hearts
knowing
from
this
deep
faith
and
trust
in
the
universe
through
the
heart
we
operate
from
a
knowing
that
there
is
no
need
to
control
the
world
around
us
and
there
is
no
need
to
latch
on
to
anything
we
begin
to
feel
into
the
safety
and
support
that
is
always
present
and
available
to
us
as
you
slowly
edge
further
towards
sleep
allow
your
breath
to
rock
you
into
a
deeply
transformative
state
of
relaxation
where
this
surrendering
process
will
continue
each
breath
guides
you
back
to
the
present
moment
each
mindful
breath
is
an
act
of
surrender
by
releasing
any
mental
beliefs
we
carry
we
allow
ourselves
to
come
further
into
the
body
into
the
breath
and
into
the
feeling
of
this
present
moment
by
releasing
the
stories
of
our
past
and
the
beliefs
about
our
present
and
our
future
we
break
overly
used
energy
patterns
so
that
we
may
repurpose
our
energetic
stores
the
use
by
our
highest
and
most
divinely
connected
selves
feel
into
the
freedom
the
love
and
the
peace
that
presents
itself
by
way
of
this
sweet
surrender
I
invite
you
now
to
gently
introduce
a
few
words
to
help
reaffirm
this
process
of
letting
go
and
to
guide
you
into
sleep
through
each
breath
cycle
begin
to
repeat
it
is
safe
to
let
go
it
is
safe
to
let
go
allow
these
words
to
gently
guide
you
towards
a
deeply
restorative
slumber
with
each
breath
cycle
feel
yourself
surrendering
even
a
little
deeper
still
it
is
safe
to
let
go
it
is
safe
to
let
go
allow
these
words
to
carry
you
for
as
long
as
necessary
and
soon
you
will
find
yourself
easing
peacefully
into
sleep
the
surrender
will
continue
throughout
the
night
while
your
whole
body
and
mind
rest
peacefully
gently
releasing
your
attachments
freeing
your
energy
and
filling
your
innermost
being
with
freedom
peace
and
lightness
it
is
safe
to
let
go
it
is
safe
to
let
go
it
is
safe
to
let
go
it
is
safe
to
let
go
it
is
safe
to
let
go

safe
to

you
you
youhello
and
welcome
to
this
short
guided
meditation
that
will
help
you
to
relax
deeply
as
you
release
and
transform
any
troubles
you
are
experiencing
with
the
help
of
the
ocean
's
waves
my
name
is
jason
stevenson
and
i
invite
you
to
open
your
heart
and
mind
to
this
transformative
practice
let
the
top
of
your
head
stretch
up
towards
the
ceiling
and
your
shoulders
to
soften
towards
the
earth
eyes
closed
and
turn
your
attention
inwards
as
you
observe
the
gentle
rhythm
of
your
breathing
and
as
you
watch
the
breath
flow
into
and
out
of
your
lungs
notice
how
it
resembles
the
steady
flow
of
waves
against
a
sandy
beach
in
this
moment
your
body
is
the
shore
and
the
breath
is
the
ebb
and
flow
of
nature
's
mysterious
force
take
a
few
moments
to
let
the
breath
naturally
guide
you
into
a
deeper
state
of
relaxation
just
as
the
ocean
's
waves
tend
to
lull
us
into
a
place
of
peace
and
tranquility
soften
your
belly
as
you
breathe
and
relax
your
shoulders
seeing
if
the
breath
might
like
to
move
a
bit
deeper
into
your
body
you
do
n't
need
to
force
anything
simply
observe
the
rhythm
that
is
present
and
now
i
invite
you
to
turn
your
attention
towards
the
mind
's
eye
to
the
seat
of
your
capacity
for
inspired
visualization
and
from
within
this
space
i
invite
you
to
imagine
that
you
were
standing
firmly
grounded
on
a
warm
tropical
beach
the
ocean
just
a
dozen
meters
ahead
of
you
sparkles
beneath
the
beaming
sun
soft
waves
crash
gently
against
the
steady
shore
forever
flowing
back
out
to
the
vastness
from
which
they
came
the
air
is
a
comfortable
temperature
warming
each
cell
bone
and
corner
of
your
soul
you
look
left
and
right
realizing
that
no
one
is
here
but
you
this
healing
space
is
all
yours
to
enjoy
in
peace
and
tranquility
so
take
a
moment
to
ground
yourself
by
feeling
the
soles
of
your
feet
against
the
multitude
of
grains
of
sand
beneath
you
the
warmth
from
this
surface
permeates
up
through
your
legs
your
pelvis
running
up
the
length
of
your
spine
and
then
expanding
outwards
through
your
arms
and
up
to
the
crown
of
your
head
you
tilt
your
head
gently
as
your
face
extends
towards
the
sun
and
you
begin
to
feel
any
weight
you've
been
carrying
melt
from
your
body
take
a
long
deep
breath
in
and
out
and
slowly
you
make
your
way
closer
towards
the
water
's
edge
you
pause
just
a
few
meters
away
from
it
and
settle
yourself
into
the
sand
coming
to
a
seated
position
feel
into
the
sensation
of
the
warm
sandy
surface
embracing
each
inch
of
your
skin
that
comes
into
contact
with
it
as
you
sink
into
this
unfolding
moment
you
begin
to
surrender
any
barriers
that
exist
within
you
to
experience
deep
peace
and
relaxation
you
know
that
in
this
moment
there
is
nothing
you
need
to
do
nothing
you
need
to
accomplish
and
nothing
you
need
to
be
you
know
that
you
are
enough
as
you
are
and
that
this
moment
is
enough
as
it
is
and
as
you
watch
the
luminous
waves
crashing
against
the
sandy
shore
just
before
you
you
offer
up
to
these
transformative
waters
any
troubles
you
've
been
experiencing
lately
all
limitation
or
challenging
thoughts
feelings
emotions
and
stories
leave
your
body
with
each
breath
out
and
as
the
energy
of
these
thoughts
and
feelings
flow
through
the
breeze
towards
the
ocean
you
watch
as
they
are
swept
away
for
healing
and
transformation
as
each
wave
rushes
back
into
the
ocean
abyss
take
some
time
consciously
offer
up
anything
you
might
like
to
release
to
these
cleansing
waters
watch
all
of
your
troubles
be
washed
gracefully
away
and
when
you
were
ready
take
a
moment
to
come
back
to
the
simple
beauty
of
this
relaxing
space
to
the
sounds
of
the
wondrous
waves
to
the
nourishment
of
each
cleansing
breath
and
to
the
warm
glow
of
the
soothing
sun
allow
yourself
to
relax
upon
this
serene
beach
for
just
a
few
more
silent
breaths
slowly
now
let
the
imagery
of
this
tranquil
landscape
dissolve
as
you
take
three
deep
and
grounding
breaths
on
your
own
rhythm
and
after
that
last
long
exhale
let
your
breath
return
to
its
natural
cycle
and
when
you
feel
ready
to
come
back
to
the
world
around
you
slowly
open
your
eyes
you
might
want
to
spend
some
time
here
just
over
the
next
five
minutes
listening
to
the
sounds
of
the
waves
as
you
slowly
come
back
let
the
relaxing
energy
of
this
beach
move
you
through
the
day
ahead
or
the
evening
tapping
into
your
inner
source
of
peace
and
release
again
and
again

this
practice

subtly
lengthen

youhello
and
welcome
to
this
powerful
guided
meditation
my
name
is
Jason
Stephenson
thank
you
for
joining
me
this
mindfulness
meditation
and
visualization
will
lead
you
with
compassion
and
curiosity
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
state
of
relaxation
and
then
into
the
past
before
eventually
carrying
you
into
a
deep
and
peaceful
sleep
I
invite
you
to
open
your
heart
to
this
journey
to
whatever
reveals
itself
knowing
that
you
are
unconditionally
supported
in
each
and
every
moment
that
passes
allow
the
mind
to
rest
aside
as
we
move
backwards
through
time
there
is
nothing
you
will
need
to
actively
search
for
and
nothing
you
'll
need
to
find
images
and
inner
sensations
may
come
for
you
but
you
will
not
need
to
control
them
manipulate
them
or
force
them
in
any
way
simply
allow
yourself
to
open
up
entirely
to
whatever
moves
through
you
as
we
take
this
journey
allow
this
meditation
in
each
moment
to
naturally
reveal
itself
as
you
move
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
past
so
before
we
begin
take
a
moment
or
two
to
come
into
a
comfortable
lying
down
position
ensure
that
you
feel
safe
and
secure
wherever
you
are
ensure
that
your
neck
is
aligned
with
the
spine
and
your
shoulders
are
relaxed
[
Music
]
take
a
moment
to
consciously
release
all
muscles
as
you
sink
further
into
this
supportive
surface
beneath
you
take
a
few
deep
breaths
here
grounding
yourself
in
this
present
moment
use
your
breath
to
guide
you
towards
a
place
of
complete
stillness
[
Music
]
although
we
will
be
moving
through
the
expansive
field
of
time
you
can
always
ground
yourself
back
into
the
present
moment
if
you
feel
uncomfortable
at
any
point
you
are
in
complete
control
of
this
journey
so
if
any
images
or
sensations
arise
that
are
too
challenging
for
you
to
present
Lee
look
at
simply
use
your
breath
to
anchor
yourself
back
into
the
present
moment
you
are
always
always
in
control
of
your
journey
with
that
said
if
any
challenging
images
arise
or
if
the
experience
becomes
heavy
you
are
also
in
an
entirely
safe
domain
to
explore
them
images
that
arise
in
our
consciousness
can
never
hurt
us
they
are
solely
tools
or
teachers
that
hold
the
potential
to
guide
us
forward
in
powerful
and
positive
ways
know
that
you
are
universally
supported
in
each
and
every
moment
now
take
a
moment
to
come
back
to
your
body
notice
your
sense
of
touch
through
the
way
the
surfaces
around
you
make
contact
with
your
physical
body
feel
into
the
textures
that
are
present
without
moving
noting
how
they
feel
as
they
rest
against
your
skin
[
Music
]
consider
the
deeper
levels
of
the
physical
body
is
it
possible
to
become
mindful
of
the
cellular
world
[
Music
]
notice
your
muscles
and
then
invite
them
to
relax
encouraging
them
to
sink
further
into
the
surface
beneath
you
now
consider
the
presence
of
air
around
your
body
and
then
gently
follow
it
as
it
moves
within
filling
your
lungs
fully
as
you
take
a
breath
in
and
returning
to
the
world
around
you
on
your
exhale
allow
the
breath
to
become
slow
and
steady
just
like
the
subtle
lapping
of
waves
against
the
shoreline
take
a
few
breaths
on
your
own
here
following
the
innate
rhythm
of
this
life
force
that
supports
you
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
allow
yourself
to
come
into
a
state
of
relaxation
by
drawing
your
breath
to
the
heart
space
as
you
inhale
allow
your
heart
to
expand
filling
itself
to
the
outer
edges
with
peace
joy
and
clarity
and
as
you
exhale
allow
the
walls
of
the
heart
to
soften
releasing
any
tension
that
may
be
stored
there
[
Music
]
continue
to
breathe
this
way
for
a
few
more
rounds
effortlessly
quietening
the
mind
as
you
move
closer
and
closer
towards
the
true
state
of
your
heart
[
Music
]
begin
to
notice
a
growing
sense
of
peace
and
tranquility
as
you
become
more
attuned
with
the
ever
unfolding
present
moment
in
just
a
few
moments
we
will
begin
our
regression
into
the
past
allow
your
imagination
to
enrich
your
visions
as
you
move
further
and
further
into
the
mystical
landscape
we
are
about
to
enter
[
Music
]
for
just
a
few
moments
allow
the
space
before
your
third
eye
to
empty
completely
you
may
still
see
various
colors
and
swirls
of
energy
passing
before
you
there
's
no
need
to
change
or
attempt
to
control
this
instead
see
if
you
can
simply
observe
whatever
is
present
there
just
in
front
of
your
closed
eyes
[
Music
]
you
do
n't
have
to
judge
it
or
attempt
to
change
it
in
any
way
simply
notice
the
space
that
quietly
and
safely
hold
you
in
complete
stillness
[
Music
]
in
just
a
moment
your
sink
as
far
into
relaxation
as
is
required
for
your
personal
present
moment
and
needs
simply
follow
my
voice
as
I
count
down
guiding
you
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
state
of
all-encompassing
peace
and
tranquility

you
are
feeling
safe
and
secure
embraced
by
this
open
space

and

is
being
released

are

slowly
deeply

effortlessly

you
have
arrived
completely
at
peace

relaxed
[
Music

all
is
quiet
all
is
at
peace
now
something
starts
to
appear
before
your
eyes
out
of
the
vast
empty
space
before
you
you
notice
a
mist
developing
it
is
airy
and
enchanted
somehow
beckoning
you
closer
you
take
a
few
steps
towards
this
mist
very
slowly
and
mindfully
and
as
you
approach
it
begins
to
dissipate
as
it
slowly
clears
you
begin
to
see
there
is
a
bridge
ahead
of
you
covered
in
moss
and
vines
you
make
your
way
towards
it
mindfully
treading
on
the
pressed
earth
beneath
your
feet
and
as
you
cross
over
everything
you
ever
knew
begins
to
disappear
all
thought
all
attachments
all
fears
and
all
worries
you
are
entering
into
a
new
world
into
a
different
time
[
Music
]
with
every
step
you
take
you
inch
closer
towards
the
space
and
time
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
it
is
a
place
that
feels
familiar
somehow
but
one
that
your
conscious
mind
can
not
put
any
memory
to
the
mist
continues
to
clear
and
you
realize
you
are
within
a
dense
majestic
forest
you
feel
at
home
you
feel
at
peace
here
[
Music

he
reached
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
and
with
the
mist
having
vanished
completely
now
you
take
a
closer
look
at
the
scenery
around
you
notice
the
colors
and
textures
of
this
vibrant
forest
consider
the
way
the
earth
feels
beneath
your
feet
[
Music

you
heighten
your
awareness
of
the
aroma
that
awakens
as
you
inhale
deeply
[
Music

allow
this
place
to
nurture
the
deep
sense
of
peace
that
is
within
you
he
walk
forward
ever
so
slightly
as
you
noticed
something
peeking
through
from
within
the
trees
and
as
you
approach
you
realize
there
is
a
cabin
hidden
within
these
woods
and
somehow
you
sense
that
it
is
or
was
your
own
you
instantly
remember
it
perhaps
becoming
flooded
with
visions
of
what
it
was
once
like
in
your
own
time
you
reach
the
front
door
and
enter
[

take
a
few
moments
to
witness
the
visuals
that
are
arising
[

does
the
cabin
look
like
what
happened
here
once
upon
a
time

is
with
you

may
come
slowly
and
subtly
simply
allow
them
to
arise
in
their
own
time
allow
your
imagination
and
intuition
to
expand
quite
effortlessly
mindfully
consider
what
was
once
here
that
no
longer
remains

open
to
whatever
arises
there
is
no
need
to
fear
the
past
it
no
longer
has
any
control
over
you

allow
yourself
to
become
the
outside
observer
of
whatever
you
feel
has
happened
here
watch
this
film
play
out

continue
to
breathe
deeply
as
you
simply
observe
whatever
is
present
without
judgment
or
condemnation
[
Music

[
Music

as
we
move
through
this
time
we
shed
old
ways
of
being
in
order
to
make
room
for
more
expansive
ones
mindfully
begin
to
consider
what
messages
or
lessons
are
being
shared
through
these
images
that
are
arising
what
is
there
to
be
learned
what
is
there
to
shed
allow
the
mind
to
remain
quiet

your
intuition
arises
tune
in
with

yourself
to
the
possibility
of
transformation

a
few
more
moments
to
witness
whatever
once
happened
at
this
beautiful
cabin
in
the
forest
[
Music

and
slowly
in
your
own
time
returned
to
the
bridge

crossing
back
over

that
it
provides
opportunity
for
growth
and
expansion
everything
you
witnessed
now
dissipates
just
as
the
mist
did
as
you
crossed
over
and
into
the
past
you
are
still
and
silent
and
for
the
moment
nothing
remains
to
be
seen
you
continue
to
allow
positive
and
empowering
lessons
to
reach
you
as
you
transition
into
a
sleeping
state
but
you
are
not
in
search
of
anything
you
are
ready
to
rest
easy
for
the
entire
night
ahead
dozing
off
swiftly
and
soundly
take
a
few
more
breaths
mindfully
inhaling
peace
contentment
and
freedom
[
Music
]
and
exhaling
everything
whatever
once
was
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
the
only
place
that
truly
exists
is
this
very
moment
everything
that
once
was
can
be
used
as
a
tool
for
self-realization
at
some
future
moment
but
for
now
allow
your
breath
to
gently
rock
you
to
sleep
allow
yourself
to
be
nourished
throughout
the
night
ahead
repeat
the
following
words
to
yourself
in
silence
as
you
gently
fall
into
a
deep
slumber
I
am
at
home
I
am
supported
I
am
at
peace
I
am
home
I
am
supported
I
am
at
peace
I
am
home
I
am
supported
I
am
NOT
peace

hello
and
welcome
to
this
guided
sleep
meditation
that
will
help
you
to
effortlessly
wind
down
and
to
fall
asleep
quickly
by
consciously
inviting
relaxation
into
your
body
and
mind
and
by
using
the
power
of
visualization
you
will
soon
enter
a
deeply
relaxed
state
that
is
conducive
of
a
solid
night's
slumber
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
I
invite
you
to
follow
me
on
this
journey
as
you
slowly
surrender
to
sleep
I
invite
you
now
to
begin
drawing
your
attention
to
your
physical
body
and
making
any
adjustments
necessary
to
facilitate
relaxation
use
any
cushions
or
blankets
you
need
for
warmth
or
support
and
also
ensure
that
any
distracting
lights
are
turned
off
and
that
your
blinds
are
drawn
[
Music
]
see
if
you
can
comfortably
form
one
straight
line
from
tailbone
to
neck
and
then
let
your
limbs
relax
wherever
they
are
comfortable
close
your
eyes
if
you
've
not
done
so
and
take
a
few
slow
and
steady
breaths
to
settle
in
[
Music
]
as
we
move
through
this
meditation
know
that
there
is
nothing
you
need
to
achieve
or
accomplish
simply
let
these
words
flow
effortlessly
through
you
use
them
to
ground
your
attention
if
the
mind
wanders
away
into
less
than
settling
thoughts
now
let
us
begin
by
practicing
some
deep
belly
breathing
to
help
us
shift
further
into
the
body's
rest
and
digest
state
of
being
so
begin
by
drawing
your
attention
to
the
stomach
perhaps
placing
a
hand
there
if
you
like
and
after
your
next
full
exhalation
take
a
deep
breath
in
letting
the
belly
expand
as
the
air
enters
into
you
hold
the
breath
at
the
top
for
just
a
second
and
then
slowly
let
the
air
back
out
through
the
pursed
lips
just
watching
the
belly
fall
when
you
reach
the
bottom
hold
the
air
out
for
just
a
second
or
two
and
then
take
another
full
deep
breath
in
so
continue
to
breathe
in
this
way
for
just
a
few
moments
on
your
own
letting
each
inhalation
and
each
exhalation
belong
letting
the
belly
rise
and
fall
with
each
cycle
and
also
allowing
for
a
second
pause
at
the
end
of
each
in-breath
and
each
out
breath
[
Music
]
continue
breathing
this
way
for
a
short
while
longer
letting
your
attention
ground
in
the
sensation
of
breathing
[
Music
]
and
after
your
next
exhalation
allow
your
breath
to
resume
its
natural
depth
pace
and
rhythm
[
Music
]
note
what
it
feels
like
to
be
in
your
body
now
observing
any
shifts
that
you
may
have
already
experienced
remember
that
during
meditation
when
you
are
invited
to
note
your
experience
there
is
nothing
expected
of
you
just
simply
allow
your
experience
to
be
what
it
is
in
this
moment
trusting
that
everything
is
moving
you
towards
a
greater
state
of
harmony
[
Music
]
and
take
a
moment
now
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
physical
body
noting
any
areas
of
unconscious
contraction
it
is
not
uncommon
to
hold
tension
in
the
brow
in
the
shoulders
in
the
belly
or
in
your
hips
and
so
as
you
observe
the
fullness
of
your
body
in
this
moment
see
where
you
might
be
able
to
soften
to
surrender
more
completely
to
the
earth
beneath
you
[
Music
]
if
there
is
tension
or
discomfort
that
can
not
be
consciously
relaxed
I
invite
you
to
instead
send
that
area
a
few
loving
words
of
support
you
might
even
silently
ask
what
part
of
me
is
calling
for
attention
here
bless
whatever
aspect
of
mind
or
body
comes
to
your
awareness
by
sending
it
your
kindness
and
care
[
Music
]
now
in
just
a
moment
we
'll
begin
a
soothing
visualization
that
will
help
you
to
wind
down
even
further
but
before
we
do
just
take
a
moment
to
notice
the
surface
that
hold
you
notice
the
stillness
of
your
body
and
the
support
of
the
physical
world
just
open
yourself
up
to
the
beauty
of
this
simple
quiet
moment
before
we
transition
in
the
realm
of
inspired
imagination
[
Music
]
now
I
invite
you
to
begin
visualizing
that
you
are
standing
in
a
wide-open
enchanted
corridor
with
windows
lining
the
wall
to
your
right
[
Music
]
the
high
ceiling
above
you
boasts
a
floral
mural
peach
violet
and
gold
flowers
intertwined
with
vines
decorate
the
space
overhead
the
hallway
feels
majestic
as
if
you
are
in
an
old
palace
that
time
has
forgotten
old
pieces
of
artwork
lined
the
walls
and
yet
you
know
the
space
is
well-kept
as
there
are
no
signs
of
dust
or
debris
it
is
well
kept
in
your
mind
at
the
very
least
[
Music
]
and
off
to
your
right
through
the
expansive
windows
that
line
the
corridor
you
peer
out
over
crystal
waters
a
sea
extends
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
the
skies
clear
birds
frolic
in
the
sky
and
the
waves
are
caressing
the
shore
the
Sun
is
slowly
setting
upon
this
peaceful
land
casting
a
dark
pink
light
across
the
horizon
yearning
to
smell
the
sea
breeze
you
crack
open
a
window
and
take
a
full
deep
nourishing
breath
in
and
you
let
it
back
out
[
Music
]
another
deep
salty
breath
in
through
the
nostrils
and
then
slowly
release
once
again
[
Music
]
each
breath
of
this
fresh
air
cleanses
you
purifying
body
mind
and
soul
[
Music
]
you
step
away
from
the
window
now
curious
as
to
where
this
corridor
might
lead
you
the
world
outside
is
beautiful
and
inspiring
you
long
for
a
deep
and
nourishing
rest
and
so
you
decide
to
head
out
in
search
of
a
place
to
lay
your
head
you
turn
away
from
the
window
now
and
slowly
make
your
way
down
the
corridor
your
feet
tread
lightly
you
are
completely
aware
of
each
moment
you
make
[
Music
]
you
carry
on
down
the
hallway
pausing
as
you
reach
a
closed
door
at
the
end
above
the
doorway
there
is
a
sign
that
reads
to
the
cave
of
peace
something
settles
within
you
simply
upon
reading
this
sign
and
so
you
slowly
reach
out
your
hand
to
pull
open
the
door
just
on
the
other
side
an
enchanted
spiral
staircase
presents
itself
undoubtedly
leading
you
down
towards
the
cave
of
peace
below
the
number
10
is
etched
in
gold
on
the
stone
wall
of
the
staircase
suggesting
you
are
ten
flights
up
from
the
earth
below
you
take
a
moment
to
prepare
for
the
descent
admiring
the
smooth
stone
walls
the
marble
staircase
and
the
gold-plated
hand
railing
that
spirals
effortlessly
downwards
you
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
out
and
then
you
begin
taking
the
twisting
steps
towards
the
ninth
floor
as
you
reach
the
landing
of
the
ninth
floor
you
feel
a
weight
fall
from
your
shoulders
all
the
worries
of
the
day
have
been
released
and
you
feel
yourself
breathing
deeper
easier
than
you
did
before
you
arrived
here
as
your
shoulders
drop
away
from
your
ears
your
heart
space
opens
you
feel
light
and
free
after
a
full
mindful
breath
you
carry
on
towards
the
eighth
floor
gliding
graciously
down
the
marble
steps
[
Music
]
when
you
arrive
on
this
next
landing
you
feel
your
jaw
drop
and
your
brow
relaxed
your
head
space
begins
to
feel
lighter
as
you
open
more
fully
to
this
journey
of
deep
release
taking
a
full
deep
breath
in
and
out
and
then
you
carry
on
slowly
down
the
staircase
taking
your
time
to
reach
the
seventh
floor
landing
[
Music
]
when
you
arrive
there
you
feel
a
wave
of
gratitude
wash
over
you
you
feel
grateful
for
the
air
that
nourishes
you
for
the
space
that
holds
you
and
for
the
beauty
that
lives
within
you
silently
thank
the
universe
for
all
that
you
were
blessed
with
after
another
mindful
breath
you
carry
on
down
the
staircase
pausing
when
you
reach
the
sixth
floor
[
Music
]
here
on
the
sixth
floor
you
take
a
moment
to
tune
into
your
heart
and
are
flooded
with
the
sense
of
embodied
self-love
self-care
and
self
compassion
something
within
you
awakens
to
your
own
divinity
and
in
response
you
feel
a
deep
sense
of
appreciation
for
who
you
are
exactly
as
you
are
you
take
another
moment
to
revel
in
this
sense
of
self
appreciation
before
continuing
on
down
the
marble
staircase
[
Music
]
as
you
come
to
reach
the
fifth
floor
something
within
you
whispers
for
you
to
let
go
perhaps
it
is
a
belief
you
've
been
holding
on
to
that
no
longer
serves
you
or
a
worry
you
've
been
carrying
too
heavily
[
Music
]
whatever
within
you
might
be
ready
to
depart
breathe
it
out
with
a
deep
exhalation
before
continuing
down
towards
the
fourth
floor
[
Music
]
you
'll
and
gracefully
on
the
fourth
floor
landing
and
as
you
do
you
are
overcome
with
a
sense
of
deep
trust
in
the
universe
you
realize
that
every
single
step
you
've
taken
in
this
life
has
brought
you
to
where
you
are
now
and
where
you
are
now
here
in
this
enchanted
staircase
is
serving
you
in
countless
ways
you
trust
that
this
is
exactly
where
you
were
meant
to
be
and
after
taking
a
mindful
breath
here
you
continue
your
descent
[
Music
]
soon
you
reach
the
third
floor
where
something
within
you
whispers
this
moment
is
enough
this
moment
is
enough
[
Music
]
you
pause
here
grounding
your
two
feet
into
the
solid
floor
beneath
you
you
peer
out
through
a
window
that
overlooks
the
sea
just
beyond
these
walls
and
your
heart
opens
even
wider
to
embrace
the
peace
and
simplicity
of
this
moment
yes
you
think
to
yourself
this
moment
is
enough
continuing
the
descent
you
move
your
feet
again
allowing
them
to
carry
you
gracefully
to
the
landing
below
as
you
arrive
on
the
second
floor
you
pause
yet
again
full
presence
comes
to
you
now
there
is
nothing
you
seek
nothing
you
are
grasping
at
and
while
yes
some
part
of
you
longs
to
rest
completely
by
dozing
off
into
slumber
there
is
no
anxiety
in
you
about
it
you
know
that
you
will
arrive
there
very
soon
and
that
it
will
be
this
peaceful
present
energy
that
assists
you
in
getting
to
that
state
with
ears
two
more
flights
to
go
and
so
you
continue
your
journey
towards
the
first
floor
landing
as
you
arrive
on
the
main
floor
you
feel
completely
and
deeply
grounded
fully
aware
of
your
connection
to
the
earth
beneath
and
around
you
you
know
that
you
are
well
rooted
in
this
life
and
in
this
moment
you
feel
centered
stable
and
supported
a
sign
by
the
top
step
of
the
next
set
of
stairs
reads
to
the
cave
of
peace
and
so
you
take
a
full
deep
breath
once
again
then
you
make
your
way
step
by
step
to
that
final
floor
just
beneath
the
earth
and
as
you
step
off
that
final
stair
you
find
yourself
in
a
wide-open
room
that
is
indeed
cave-like
and
lit
with
candles
it
is
the
most
elegant
cave
you
have
ever
seen
majestic
in
its
outfit
a
splendid
rug
the
color
of
mole
breeze
and
the
Tuscan
Sun
covers
much
of
the
floor
off
to
the
side
a
four-poster
bed
sits
elegantly
it
is
adorned
with
plush
cushions
and
blankets
that
cause
you
towards
it
and
yet
before
you
go
you
take
a
moment
to
admire
the
quietude
of
this
space
the
simplicity
the
elegance
and
the
comfort
the
candle
light
soothes
your
soul
as
it
flickers
against
the
walls
of
the
cave
[
Music
]
and
now
ready
to
rest
your
head
you
take
a
moment
to
gently
blow
out
all
of
the
candles
in
the
room
leaving
the
one
next
to
your
bed
for
last
[
Music
]
you
make
your
final
preparations
for
sleep
and
then
you
crawl
into
the
cozy
bed
before
you
when
you
are
settled
you
blow
out
the
last
remaining
candle
and
sink
into
the
darkness
of
this
room
your
body
rejoices
at
the
comfort
of
this
place
you
have
found
yourself
in
it
feels
well
supported
and
fully
nourished
in
this
abode
the
space
is
quiet
cozy
and
peaceful
and
so
you
prepare
to
let
your
entire
body
ease
into
a
deep
slumber
there
's
settle
more
completely
you
come
back
to
your
breath
held
safely
in
this
night
you
allow
your
belly
to
soften
and
the
breath
to
flow
as
deep
as
it
is
comfortable
to
with
each
breath
ian
you
feel
a
sense
of
universal
love
and
support
entering
you
and
with
each
breath
out
you
free
yourself
of
any
tension
that
no
longer
serves
you
[
Music
]
your
breath
resumes
its
natural
pace
now
as
you
draw
your
attention
to
the
top
of
your
head
as
you
hold
this
space
in
your
awareness
you
send
it
your
love
and
invite
it
to
relax
as
you
exhale
gently
your
attention
shifts
towards
the
space
between
your
eyebrows
and
in
the
same
way
you
witness
love
and
ease
this
part
of
you
through
your
presence
and
through
your
breath
[
Music
]
you
continue
in
the
same
way
nourishing
your
cheeks
and
your
jaw
your
tongue
and
your
mouth
softening
relaxing
[
Music
]
and
your
throat
and
shoulders
dropping
letting
go
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
next
you
trace
the
length
of
your
left
arm
all
the
way
to
your
fingertips
inviting
it
to
soften
into
the
surface
beneath
you
[
Music
]
repeating
the
same
on
the
opposite
side
you
allow
your
right
arm
to
be
seen
and
to
relax
completely
you
trace
it
from
the
right
shoulder
all
the
way
to
your
fingertips
draw
your
attention
now
back
to
the
heart
space
holding
this
loving
center
of
your
being
in
full
awareness
as
you
breathe
into
the
heart
watch
it
expand
and
as
you
exhale
from
the
heart
allowed
to
soften
your
attention
slowly
shifts
down
your
spine
relaxing
each
vertebrae
and
the
surrounding
muscles
as
you
gently
make
your
way
towards
your
stomach
and
as
you
hold
your
belly
in
your
awareness
you
offer
it
your
love
and
invite
it
to
rest
for
the
night
you
hold
your
pelvis
and
your
hips
and
your
loving
awareness
next
breathing
into
it
and
out
of
this
space
completely
and
then
slowly
you
draw
this
loving
awareness
down
the
left-leg
inviting
it
to
relax
in
its
entirety
all
the
way
down
to
your
toes
[
Music
]
you
then
come
back
up
to
the
right
hip
and
slowly
repeat
this
process
of
softening
as
you
scan
the
length
of
your
right
leg
all
the
way
down
to
your
toes
[
Music
]
now
hold
your
entire
body
in
your
awareness
letting
each
inhalation
move
all
the
way
into
the
farthest
reaches
of
your
being
and
each
exhalation
to
soften
the
entire
body
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
the
body
is
relaxed
the
mind
is
relaxed
and
now
nothing
stands
between
you
and
a
deep
peaceful
sleep
[
Music
]
the
envisioned
room
in
your
mind
's
eye
dissolves
as
you
realize
you
are
once
again
in
the
room
that
holds
you
physically
and
though
you
are
no
longer
in
the
cave
of
peace
that
once
held
you
it
has
bestowed
its
energy
upon
each
one
of
yourselves
it
's
peaceful
presence
remains
with
you
[
Music
]
continue
to
mind
your
breath
gently
now
as
you
slowly
allow
yourself
to
sink
into
a
deep
and
peaceful
night
's
sleep
rest
well
my
friend
rest
well

youhello
and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
and
visualization
that
will
help
you
to
cleanse
negative
energy
from
both
mind
and
body
before
leading
you
into
a
restorative
night
's
sleep
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
I
invite
you
to
set
the
world
you
know
aside
as
you
open
your
heart
and
mind
to
the
possibility
of
awakening
new
inspired
energy
to
begin
take
a
moment
to
find
a
comfortable
lying
down
position
and
using
whatever
blankets
and
pillows
you
need
for
support
and
then
closing
your
eyes
when
you
're
ready
soften
your
brow
[
Music
]
your
jaw
and
your
limbs
just
allowing
your
entire
body
to
soften
into
the
surface
beneath
you
before
we
dive
deeper
into
this
visualization
let
's
take
a
moment
to
mindfully
tune
into
the
present
moment
beginning
with
the
breath
noticing
the
path
that
your
breath
takes
as
it
moves
through
you
beginning
as
it
enters
your
nostrils
moves
through
your
windpipe
and
fills
your
lungs
and
then
notice
the
same
path
but
in
Reverse
watching
how
the
chest
and
belly
soften
as
you
exhale
[
Music
]
observe
that
gentle
subtle
movement
of
the
body
as
you
breathe
becoming
more
aware
of
the
aliveness
of
your
being
and
now
as
the
breath
enters
I
invite
you
to
draw
your
attention
towards
the
stomach
welcoming
the
breath
to
flow
all
the
way
into
it
and
as
you
exhale
let
the
belly
soften
completely
just
take
a
few
more
deep
belly
breaths
on
your
own
now
perhaps
releasing
a
softer
sigh
with
your
next
view
exhalations
and
now
I
invite
you
to
let
the
breath
expand
even
further
by
imagining
each
inhalation
reaching
into
the
furthest
corners
of
your
body
into
your
toes
your
fingertips
and
your
crown
and
when
you
come
to
exhale
imagine
the
breath
taking
with
it
any
and
all
tension
lingering
anywhere
within
the
body
you
breathe
into
the
fullness
of
your
being
and
then
invite
your
entire
body
to
release
as
you
exhale
take
just
a
few
more
full-body
breaths
on
your
own
when
you
were
ready
to
let
go
of
even
this
breathing
technique
let
your
breath
resume
its
natural
pace
depth
and
rhythm
in
a
few
moments
we
will
begin
a
visualization
that
will
help
you
to
cleanse
any
negative
energy
you
may
be
holding
and
as
we
move
through
this
practice
I
invite
you
to
remain
compassionate
and
patient
towards
yourself
softening
any
judgement
if
it
arises
I
encourage
this
because
it
is
not
uncommon
that
we
feel
shame
guilt
or
judgment
when
we
consider
that
we
have
been
harnessing
negative
thoughts
feelings
or
other
energies
and
yet
all
of
these
things
are
a
part
of
the
human
experience
they
offer
us
opportunities
to
learn
evolve
and
awaken
regardless
of
where
this
negative
energy
may
have
come
from
I
invite
you
to
release
any
stories
you
might
hold
about
wrongdoing
and
by
softening
shame
and
guilt
and
through
opening
up
to
ourselves
with
compassion
and
patience
we
lovingly
create
space
to
release
what
no
longer
serves
us
and
to
invite
in
the
energy
that
will
so
take
a
moment
now
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
crown
of
your
head
gently
softening
any
tension
you
might
observe
here
or
in
the
space
of
the
third
eye
relax
your
shoulders
your
arms
release
your
belly
and
any
other
unnecessary
tension
and
then
come
back
to
your
breath
as
we
prepare
to
cleanse
our
energy
field
through
the
power
of
this
visualization
calling
upon
your
innate
capacity
for
imagination
now
I
invite
you
to
envision
that
you
are
on
a
small
chartered
boat
sailing
calmly
and
gently
towards
the
shore
of
a
pristine
tropical
island
you
sit
or
stand
at
the
prow
breathing
in
the
fresh
salty
breeze
of
the
open
sea
around
you
you
have
charted
this
small
boat
for
an
island
getaway
for
a
chance
to
rest
reset
and
cleanse
yourself
of
any
negative
energy
you
've
been
exposed
to
or
have
been
holding
on
to
and
as
the
boat
nears
the
dock
at
the
shore
you
feel
your
shoulders
releasing
some
of
the
unnecessary
weight
they
've
been
carrying
no
breathing
deepens
and
finally
the
boat
pulls
up
against
the
dock
overhanging
the
turquoise
waters
you
carefully
step
on
to
the
steady
dock
turning
to
thank
the
captain
and
to
let
him
know
that
you
will
be
back
later
in
the
day
then
you
head
on
your
way
your
backpack
is
full
of
all
you
need
for
the
day
and
so
pulling
the
straps
tight
now
you
begin
your
journey
through
the
pathway
that
leads
through
the
tropical
jungle
oasis
palm
trees
and
other
lush
greenery
line
the
narrow
trail
you
find
yourself
on
birds
ring
out
in
the
trees
overhead
as
do
chirping
insects
and
croaking
amphibians
the
air
is
completely
free
of
any
man-made
sounds
you
relish
in
this
in
the
purity
of
the
symphony
that
fills
your
ears
already
you
can
feel
your
lungs
being
cleansed
your
breath
moving
deeper
and
your
body
being
filled
with
pristine
air
full
of
vitality
you
continued
on
a
little
while
longer
weaving
through
the
jungle
of
this
private
island
[
Music
]
eventually
you
come
across
a
shimmering
Azure
Blue
Lagoon
just
off
to
your
right
you
take
a
moment
's
pause
here
kneeling
down
by
the
water
's
edge
something
about
this
Lagoon
feels
enchanted
something
tells
you
that
the
water
is
listening
that
it
is
aware
of
your
presence
so
you
take
this
as
an
invitation
to
consciously
set
the
intention
to
release
any
negative
energy
that
has
been
harbored
within
you
take
a
moment
to
formulate
this
intention
in
your
own
words
and
when
you
were
ready
you
whisper
this
intention
to
the
pristine
mystic
waters
before
you
you
sense
that
simply
through
having
set
this
intention
something
has
been
released
and
that
the
process
of
deep
cleansing
and
rejuvenation
has
been
upgraded
so
you
take
a
few
final
moments
to
absorb
the
beauty
of
this
Lagoon
and
then
you
continue
along
the
path
that
has
gotten
ooh
this
far
continuing
to
make
your
way
through
the
lush
environment
you
've
retreated
to
you
feel
a
deep
sense
of
gratitude
for
this
opportunity
to
clear
your
energy
field
[
Music
]
not
only
do
you
thank
the
environment
that
is
supporting
you
now
but
you
also
feel
a
sense
of
appreciation
for
the
part
of
you
that
made
this
retreat
a
priority
you
thank
yourself
for
this
act
of
self-care
you
carry
on
until
soon
the
path
widens
slowly
transitioning
from
soil
to
sand
and
as
you
make
your
way
through
the
last
layers
of
trees
on
this
opposite
side
of
the
island
your
jaw
drops
at
the
purity
of
the
white
sand
beach
before
you
and
at
the
calm
turquoise
waters
that
ripple
out
from
the
island
you've
arrived
at
a
place
where
you
can
allow
all
remaining
negativity
to
be
cleared
from
your
being
you
are
certain
that
this
is
the
place
for
it
and
so
you
take
off
your
shoes
carrying
them
in
one
hand
as
you
walk
closer
towards
the
water
you
walk
slowly
allowing
your
feet
to
sink
into
the
warm
sand
with
each
step
a
few
meters
from
where
the
soft
wave
slap
against
the
shore
you
drop
your
bag
and
your
shoes
letting
your
feet
ground
into
the
sand
rooting
yourself
through
your
feet
you
then
stretch
your
arms
up
towards
the
sky
your
heart
opens
as
your
chest
pushes
forward
welcoming
the
radiance
of
the
Sun
the
sky
and
sea
you
let
your
arms
come
to
rest
by
your
sides
now
as
you
gaze
out
over
the
open
waters
with
not
a
single
other
landmass
inside
you
feel
as
if
you
're
a
world
away
from
the
everyday
you
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
letting
it
go
with
a
sigh
and
then
you
lay
out
your
towel
and
prepare
to
head
into
the
calm
and
cleansing
waters
you
remember
the
intention
you
had
said
to
cleanse
yourself
of
any
negative
energies
perhaps
negative
thoughts
feelings
habits
or
more
subtle
energies
that
no
longer
serve
you
and
as
you
begin
walking
towards
the
water
you
invite
these
negative
energies
to
come
to
the
forefront
of
your
mind
and
you
hold
them
here
not
to
judge
criticize
or
condemn
them
but
to
silently
let
them
know
that
you
can
see
them
and
to
let
them
know
that
it
is
time
for
them
to
be
let
go
[
Music
]
slowly
wading
into
the
water
you
let
the
cool
sea
brush
against
your
skin
beginning
to
cleanse
you
from
the
outside
continuing
on
until
you
are
waist-deep
you
pause
and
then
you
bring
your
palms
together
in
front
of
your
body
inviting
all
negative
energies
to
be
held
between
them
raising
your
arms
up
and
overhead
you
let
these
negative
energies
begin
moving
away
from
your
body
and
you
throw
them
forward
sending
them
off
into
the
sea
as
your
hands
dip
underwater
all
the
negative
energies
you
once
held
begin
to
dissolve
in
the
salty
water
that
surrounds
you
you
let
the
water
to
continue
to
cleanse
you
of
all
negative
energies
that
you
do
not
wish
to
hold
on
to
you
can
even
watch
all
the
negative
attachments
float
away
from
you
[
Music
]
all
negative
beliefs
and
stories
all
self-limiting
beliefs
and
any
of
the
negative
energies
you
've
picked
up
from
the
world
around
you
all
of
it
is
now
dissolving
in
the
ocean
feel
free
to
roll
on
your
back
floating
here
safely
for
some
time
as
the
sunshine
beams
down
on
you
[
Music
]
slowly
the
subtle
waves
carry
you
back
towards
the
shoreline
and
as
you
get
closer
you
rise
to
your
feet
and
slowly
make
your
way
back
onto
the
beach
resting
your
back
on
your
towel
you
lie
down
here
and
let
the
Sun
and
the
Seabreeze
continue
to
cleanse
you
you
notice
there
is
far
more
room
to
breathe
now
to
breathe
in
light
love
and
positivity
the
negative
energies
you
once
held
now
feel
so
distant
and
all
you
are
left
with
is
room
to
grow
new
ideas
new
beliefs
and
new
dreams
and
to
conjure
up
new
energies
you
feel
immensely
blessed
for
this
transformation
and
as
the
Sun
beams
down
on
you
you
sense
it
awakening
each
and
every
cell
in
your
body
it
awakens
the
cells
in
your
toes
your
feet
your
lower
legs
your
knees
and
your
thighs
it
reinvigorates
the
cells
in
your
hips
your
pelvis
and
your
root
chakra
[
Music
]
it
brings
new
life
to
your
belly
your
lower
back
your
chest
and
your
heart
and
your
upper
back
and
in
the
same
way
it
awakens
all
the
cells
in
your
arms
from
your
fingertips
right
up
to
your
shoulders
the
cells
and
energy
center
in
your
throat
awakens
to
as
do
all
the
cells
in
your
face
finally
the
top
of
your
head
the
crown
area
opens
up
to
the
sunlight
completely
becoming
a
portal
for
positive
energy
to
flow
through
your
entire
body
you
are
fully
alive
here
fully
awake
and
positively
inspired
you
come
back
to
your
breath
letting
each
inhalation
spread
throughout
your
entire
body
and
each
exhalation
to
soften
you
you
melt
into
the
sand
a
little
bit
further
with
each
breath
knowing
there
is
nothing
you
need
to
hold
on
to
here
a
great
wave
of
compassion
washes
through
you
as
you
bless
yourself
but
the
places
you
've
been
and
the
courage
of
harnessed
to
arrive
here
letting
go
and
allowing
for
cleansing
to
happen
is
not
always
easy
and
so
you
feel
immense
appreciation
to
yourself
for
opening
up
in
this
way
[
Music
]
you
also
feel
a
growing
compassion
for
all
those
who
've
crossed
your
path
for
those
who
have
been
weighed
down
by
their
own
negative
energy
-
you
see
the
goodness
and
light
at
the
core
of
everything
you
spend
just
a
few
more
moments
here
on
the
sand
beneath
the
Sun
and
then
you
slowly
rise
to
your
feet
and
prepare
to
head
back
to
the
boat
that
awaits
you
you
take
one
last
look
at
the
beach
and
see
that
so
graciously
held
you
offering
them
your
thanks
and
you
turn
towards
the
path
that
brought
you
here
slowly
venturing
back
into
the
tropical
abyss
as
you
walk
you
feel
a
lightness
in
your
steps
and
in
your
entire
body
you
move
with
ease
and
grace
all
parts
of
you
are
now
deeply
cleansed
soon
you
make
your
way
back
to
the
lagoon
where
you
had
powerfully
set
your
intention
you
pause
at
its
edge
letting
an
inner
smile
spread
through
you
all
of
a
sudden
the
tropical
Symphony
begins
to
grow
louder
the
birds
chirp
with
glee
from
their
perches
the
frogs
croak
with
contentment
and
the
insects
sing
in
their
own
way
it
sounds
to
you
as
though
the
jungle
is
applauding
rejoicing
in
this
return
to
your
natural
state
of
being
you
continue
on
your
way
leaving
the
lagoon
behind
positive
energy
continues
to
spread
through
you
eventually
you
arrive
back
at
the
outer
limits
of
the
jungle
noting
the
dock
and
the
boat
that
awaits
you
slowly
you
make
your
way
over
towards
it
thanking
the
captain
for
his
time
you
climb
back
in
taking
a
comfortable
seat
on
the
boat
and
as
it
slowly
pulls
away
from
the
dock
and
the
island
you
look
back
in
love
and
admiration
of
your
experience
here
you
consider
how
unconditionally
you
were
held
by
the
sand
and
by
the
sea
feeling
in
complete
alignment
with
the
world
you
thank
the
sea
for
cleansing
you
of
the
energies
you
no
longer
needed
and
you
imagine
these
energies
slowly
sinking
to
the
ocean
floor
where
they
will
be
transformed
into
their
raw
pure
elements
[
Music
]
as
the
boat
continues
towards
the
nearest
mainland
you
let
your
back
come
to
rest
on
its
surface
it
's
smooth
and
steady
journey
across
the
water
lulls
you
towards
slumber
a
state
that
will
continue
to
process
all
of
the
transformation
you
experienced
here
you
take
one
more
deep
breath
in
of
the
sea
breeze
and
as
you
exhale
you
gently
release
the
imagery
of
this
beautiful
cleansing
landscape
grounding
yourself
back
into
the
surface
that
supports
you
in
this
reality
carrying
the
experience
of
being
cleansed
into
the
awakened
life
notice
the
natural
ebb
and
flow
of
your
breathing
using
it
to
anchor
you
anytime
the
mind
wanders
in
these
next
few
moments
before
sleep
and
as
you
slowly
drift
off
let
the
following
affirmations
flow
through
you
to
reaffirm
the
cleansing
that
has
taken
place
as
these
words
float
through
your
subconscious
mind
they
will
help
to
embed
this
new
reality
into
your
daily
life

[

you
hello
my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
welcome
to
this
guided
meditation
to
help
you
release
all
muscular
tension
and
to
help
you
fall
into
a
deep
and
peaceful
sleep
of
this
meditation
you
will
be
guided
to
bring
your
awareness
to
each
area
of
the
body
to
feel
into
it
to
tighten
it
and
then
to
release
it
completely
allowing
the
entire
body
to
come
to
a
state
of
total
relaxation
so
before
we
begin
this
journey
just
ensure
that
all
end
of
day
matters
are
taken
care
of
if
you
require
an
alarm
to
be
set
just
quietly
set
it
now
if
there
are
blinds
that
need
to
be
drawn
or
bright
lights
that
can
be
turned
off
just
take
care
of
these
small
matters
before
settling
into
a
comfortable
lying
down
position
[
Music
]
wherever
you
are
and
sure
that
the
spine
and
neck
are
straight
but
relaxed
and
that
you
are
supported
in
any
way
that
you
need
take
your
time
to
adjust
any
cushions
or
blankets
so
the
gyrus
comfortable
as
possible
in
this
very
moment
[
Music
]
set
an
intention
now
to
fully
let
go
through
both
body
and
mind
as
we
enter
a
process
of
complete
release
now
let's
begin
by
becoming
more
mindful
of
this
exact
moment
in
time
and
space
begin
by
drawing
your
awareness
to
your
ears
and
to
all
the
sounds
that
you
may
currently
be
infiltrating
through
them
you
open
your
hearing
simply
observe
all
the
sounds
that
come
from
subtle
hums
to
more
prominent
noises
outside
you
without
judging
or
labeling
these
sounds
practice
remaining
in
a
state
of
deep
awareness
as
vibrations
filter
into
your
eardrums
and
as
they
disappear
allow
the
Mayans
tendencies
to
categorize
to
label
and
the
judge
to
step
aside
as
you
simply
witness
these
noises
as
dynamic
expressions
of
life
as
simple
and
subtle
vibrations
of
energy
now
expand
your
awareness
of
this
present
moment
by
beginning
to
observe
the
physical
space
you
rest
in
notice
the
air
that
touches
your
skin
and
the
material
world
that
supports
and
surrounds
you
[
Music
]
take
a
few
moments
to
observe
each
inch
of
your
body
that
is
in
contact
with
the
physical
world
[
Music
]
you
might
come
to
notice
the
temperature
of
your
body
and
surfaces
around
you
you
might
observe
the
textures
of
blankets
and
pillows
that
brush
against
your
skin
[
Music
]
and
you
might
even
observe
a
barely
describable
feeling
of
support
of
safety
or
of
heaviness
as
you
sink
further
into
the
surface
beneath
you
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
notice
if
the
body
's
formation
or
sensory
experience
changes
in
any
way
as
you
become
more
mindful
of
this
physical
space
you
are
in
[
Music
]
become
more
mindful
now
of
your
breath
quietly
observing
the
rhythm
and
depth
of
its
present
form
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
to
be
mindful
does
not
mean
to
change
or
to
manipulate
the
present
moment
in
any
way
that
the
mind
deemed
to
make
better
or
worthy
to
the
contrary
mindful
awareness
asks
us
to
open
to
and
to
accept
this
moment
exactly
as
it
is
so
with
this
in
mind
see
if
you
can
open
to
your
breath
exactly
as
it
is
right
now
releasing
any
judgment
or
expectation
for
it
to
feel
any
differently
than
it
presently
does
[
Music
]
if
a
natural
deepening
occurs
allow
this
simply
noticing
it
as
a
natural
movement
of
energy
further
into
your
being
[
Music
]
continue
to
observe
the
breath
for
a
few
more
moments
feeling
into
the
expression
of
each
inhalation
and
each
exhalation
notice
the
feeling
of
air
entering
through
your
nasal
cavity
filling
your
lungs
and
pressing
upward
against
your
belly
[
Music
]
and
then
notice
the
same
dynamic
movement
in
Reverse
observing
any
sensations
connected
to
your
fall
exhalation
[
Music
]
just
breathe
here
in
mindful
awareness
for
a
few
more
silent
moments
[
Music
]
if
the
mind
wanders
at
any
point
during
this
meditation
see
if
you
can
refrain
from
judgment
as
you
compassionately
call
your
attention
back
to
the
present
moment
it
is
in
the
minds
nature
to
wander
but
with
that
said
we
can
use
the
power
of
our
intention
to
refocus
our
attention
back
on
this
present
moment
this
refocusing
is
what
helps
us
to
enter
an
expanding
state
of
complete
of
relaxation
in
just
a
few
moments
we
will
enter
into
a
full-body
scan
through
which
you
will
become
deeply
aware
of
the
presence
of
tightness
in
the
body
and
then
of
the
feeling
of
complete
relaxation
you
will
be
guided
to
witness
tighten
and
release
each
area
that
we
pass
allowing
each
part
of
the
body
to
come
to
deep
rest
and
complete
ease
in
preparation
for
a
peaceful
night
's
sleep
[
Music
]
as
much
as
possible
see
if
you
can
align
tightening
movements
with
your
inhalations
and
all
movements
towards
release
with
your
exhalations
just
breathe
naturally
in
between
each
muscle
group
that
we
work
on
[
Music
]
so
before
we
begin
into
this
body
scan
I
invite
you
to
make
any
adjustments
now
that
will
help
you
to
feel
into
the
entirety
of
your
body
you
might
find
that
it
is
easiest
to
access
each
muscle
when
in
a
straight
line
down
position
on
your
back
however
if
this
is
not
comfortable
for
you
come
into
a
position
that
is
as
neutral
as
possible
while
remaining
comfortable
ensure
that
the
chest
is
open
with
shoulders
drawing
away
from
the
ears
allow
your
breath
to
continue
to
be
in
the
background
of
your
awareness
secondary
only
to
your
gently
shifting
awareness
of
the
physical
body
so
begin
by
noticing
your
toes
feeling
into
them
exactly
as
they
are
in
this
moment
notice
if
there
are
any
sensations
present
any
tiredness
or
softness
[
Music
]
and
now
consciously
tighten
just
your
toes
on
your
next
inhalation
observing
what
it
feels
like
for
them
to
be
pulled
inwards
completely
and
then
exhale
letting
them
go
and
allowing
all
tension
melting
away
with
ease
[
Music
]
now
bring
your
awareness
towards
both
feet
toes
and
ankles
included
observing
them
exactly
as
they
are
in
this
moment
on
the
next
breath
in
tensor
muscles
in
the
feet
area
holding
tightly
for
just
a
brief
moment
and
then
release
all
of
the
tension
on
your
exhalation
allowing
your
feet
toes
and
ankles
to
rest
back
down
completely
and
breathing
normally
for
a
few
moments
[
Music
]
observe
now
the
presence
of
both
of
your
lakes
drawing
your
awareness
all
the
way
from
your
heels
up
to
your
hips
noting
any
sensations
you
pass
along
the
way
hold
the
entirety
of
both
legs
in
your
awareness
and
then
inhale
as
you
tighten
these
muscles
squeezing
them
in
towards
your
midline
hold
there
for
a
moment
and
then
exhale
releasing
them
completely
into
the
surface
beneath
you
[
Music
]
moving
to
the
area
between
the
hips
draw
your
awareness
to
your
pelvis
on
your
next
breath
in
tighten
all
of
these
muscles
holding
them
for
just
a
brief
moment
and
then
release
them
completely
on
your
next
breath
out
just
feel
into
this
complete
release
from
your
pelvis
downward
letting
each
of
these
areas
sink
further
into
the
support
of
the
physical
world
[
Music
]
observe
the
stomach
region
now
becoming
aware
of
its
present
state
and
then
as
you
inhale
tighten
all
of
these
core
muscles
holding
them
in
tightly
for
just
a
moment
as
you
hold
the
breath
in
and
then
release
entirely
as
you
exhale
softening
all
muscles
around
the
belly
return
to
your
natural
breathing
rhythm
as
you
relax
the
stomach
completely
[
Music
]
now
expand
your
awareness
of
the
stomach
to
encompass
the
entire
tosser
from
lower
back
to
upper
and
from
belly
up
to
the
shoulders
take
a
moment
now
to
observe
each
muscle
group
in
the
core
of
your
body
[
Music
]
now
on
your
next
inhalation
tighten
them
or
towards
the
midline
of
your
body
feeling
them
in
a
contracted
state
and
then
release
heavily
with
a
sigh
allowing
your
entire
torso
to
relax
completely
[
Music
]
take
a
moment
here
to
reconnect
with
your
breath
mindfully
observing
its
present
form
[
Music

bring
your
awareness
now
to
your
hands
fingers
included
observe
the
way
they
are
resting
in
this
moment
noticing
if
they
are
relaxed
or
tense
or
somewhere
in
between
[
Music
]
as
you
inhale
allow
all
of
these
muscles
in
the
hands
and
fingers
to
tighten
coming
into
a
compressed
fist
hold
for
a
brief
second
or
two
and
then
exhale
as
you
release
allowing
both
hands
to
rest
completely
relaxed
[
Music

draw
your
awareness
now
from
your
wrists
all
the
way
up
to
your
shoulders
and
compasses
all
the
muscles
and
areas
in
between
so
inhale
as
you
contract
all
of
these
muscles
perhaps
pulling
them
up
towards
your
ears
and
then
soften
releasing
all
of
these
muscles
in
the
limbs
back
down
shoulders
falling
back
down
gently
as
well
notice
how
different
it
feels
in
both
body
and
mind
between
your
contracted
States
and
your
softened
ones
now
begin
to
observe
all
of
the
intricate
muscles
in
your
face
noticing
if
there
are
any
sensations
present
here
consider
the
muscles
in
your
jaw
your
cheeks
your
eyebrows
and
your
forward
[
Music

now
inhale
as
you
contract
all
of
these
muscles
squeezing
your
entire
face
together
hold
for
just
a
moment
observing
the
sensation
and
then
exhale
as
you
release
all
of
these
muscles
completely
let
go
of
each
muscle
allowing
all
tension
to
drain

the
surface
below
you

that
there
is
no
need
to
hold
on
you
can
simply
let
go
into
sleep

scan
your

bring
your
attention
to
the
top
of
your

welcome
this
ease
into
your

and
eyes

any
facial
expression
release
the
tiny
muscles
around
your

your

becoming
heavy

let
go
of
any
gripping
in
your
hips

allow
your

to
rest
heavy
on
the
surface
below
you
as
if
there
is
no
difference
between
where
you
end
and
where
the
surface
begins
you
may
find
that
the
simple
act
of
paying
attention
to
a
specific
body
part
allows
it
to
relax
and
let
go
since
now
your
ankles
and
feet
releasing
and
relaxing
completely
take
another
moment
to
slowly
scan
your
body
once
more
[

this
time
notice
any
areas
that
may
still
be
holding
on
to
any
lingering
tension
and
after
acknowledging
and
accepting
your
present
experience
ask
your
body
to
let
go
simply
let
go
of
the
need
to
be
in
control
and
surrender
to
the
support
of
the
surface
below
you
your
body
is
safe
and
supported
and
knows
what
to
do
to
relax

you
simply
allow
the
tension
to
release

in
addition
to
the
added
suffering
that
occurs
when
you
resist
the
way
things
are
you
may
also
experience
suffering
when
you
are
not
accepting
of
yourself
self-acceptance
means
accepting
yourself
exactly
as
you
are
without
any
wishes
of
how
you
should
be
there
is
a
possibility
for
change
only
after
the
reality
has
been
accepted
and
believed
to
be
true
the
practice
of
self-acceptance
is
a
step
toward
freedom
and
happiness
in
your
life
self-acceptance
is
knowing
deep
down
in
your
heart
that
you
are
enough
as
you
are
it
means
being
comfortable
with
your
body
your
emotions
and
your
mind
it
means
accepting
what
you
have
achieved
as
well
as
what
you
have
not
yet
accomplished
acceptance
of
all
your
strengths
as
well
as
what
you
may
consider
your
flaws
it
means
being
exactly
who
you
are
and
not
who
you
want
others
to
see
you
as
accepting
yourself
is
not
about
praising
yourself
or
receiving
praise
from
others
it
means
that
you
have
a
sense
from
within
that
you
feel
loved
simply
because
you
are
being
yourself
[
Music
]
when
you
love
and
accept
yourself
you
are
authentic
and
can
trust
yourself
the
first
step
on
the
path
of
self-acceptance
is
increased
awareness
as
you
build
this
awareness
of
yourself
invite
any
feelings
you
may
be
having
to
show
up
fully
welcome
both
positive
and
negative
and
honor
what
they
are
without
judging
or
trying
to
change
accept
any
positive
emotions
and
know
that
you
deserve
to
feel
good
[
Music
]
and
when
negative
emotions
come
to
the
surface
treat
yourself
as
you
would
a
loved
one
with
kindness
and
compassion
[
Music
]
know
that
these
emotions
are
just
that
emotions
they
are
not
you
they
do
not
make
you
the
person
that
you
are
[
Music
]
notice
your
emotions
as
they
show
up
for
you
now
[
Music
]
since
the
physical
feelings
of
your
emotions
and
where
in
your
body
you
may
be
experiencing
them
notice
with
curiosity
and
acceptance
experience
your
emotions
just
as
they
are
let
go
of
what
you
may
think
your
thoughts
or
your
emotions
should
be
without
changing
anything
simply
meet
yourself
exactly
where
you
are
in
the
present
moment
and
be
aware
of
yourself
the
second
step
towards
self-acceptance
is
loving-kindness
and
compassion
for
yourself
in
order
to
fully
love
and
accept
yourself
you
must
let
go
of
limiting
beliefs
and
self-defeating
behaviors
let
go
of
anything
that
no
longer
serves
you
on
your
journey
to
self-acceptance
take
a
moment
to
let
go
of
all
the
behaviors
and
beliefs
that
no
longer
serve
you
or
are
working
against
you
[
Music
]
there
is
no
need
to
name
these
specifically
right
now
simply
let
the
negative
energy
go
and
replace
it
with
positive
energy
make
space
for
acceptance
[
Music
]
let
go
of
judgments
of
ourselves
and
comparisons
to
others
let
go
of
unmet
and
unrealistic
expectations
let
go
of
the
need
for
perfection
to
be
human
is
to
be
imperfect
let
go
of
comparisons
with
past
versions
of
yourself
let
go
of
negative
self-talk
let
go
of
shame
and
let
go
of
guilt
let
it
all
go
see
all
of
this
melting
off
of
your
body
to
be
gone
from
your
life
forever
without
going
into
story
or
naming
specific
events
let
go
of
blame
of
ourselves
and
others
let
the
heavy
feeling
float
off
your
shoulders
let
go
of
blame
of
our
circumstances
let
the
sensation
dissolve
from
your
muscles
[
Music
]
let
go
of
judgment
of
good
and
bad
when
we
practice
meditation
we
can
choose
to
befriend
our
circumstances
with
compassion
in
a
moment
I
will
guide
your
subconscious
with
some
positive
affirmation
statements
of
acceptance
of
reality
as
well
as
acceptance
of
self
[
Music
]
there
is
no
need
to
repeat
these
if
you
are
so
relaxed
you
are
almost
sleeping
your
subconscious
will
hear
them
simply
believe
they
are
true
continue
to
relax
fully
and
know
that
at
the
core
of
your
being
these
statements
are
true
allow
yourself
to
drift
off
to
sleep
with
the
sound
of
my
voice
if
you
wish
through
acceptance
comes
freedom
and
peace
I
allow
my
thoughts
to
be
what
they
are

have
the

I

sleep

tonight
experienced
balanced
energy
and
a

calm
by

into
your

to
Center

the
midst
of
challenging
and
uncertain
times
connect
with
lightness
of
your
body
your
mind
your
spirit
and
your
heart
for
a
peaceful
healing
night
sleep
now
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
take
a
moment
and
make
sure
your
environment
is
all
set
for
you
to
drift
off
into
sleep
it
is
important
for
you
to
have
the
sense
of
safety
and
ease
in
your
mind
and
body
so
you
can
fully
relax
pause
the
recording
if
you
need
to
make
any
further
adjustments
bring
your
attention
now
to
your
breath
notice
your
natural
breath
rhythm
and
depth
and
now
I
invite
you
to
breathe
in
deeply
through
your
nose
counting
the
length
of
your
inhale
pause
for
a
moment
once
you
have
fully
inhaled
then
exhale
for
the
same
count
as
your
inhale
[

continue
breathing
deeply
for
a
few
cycles
while
observing
and
counting
your
breath
creating
an
equal
breath
pattern
connecting
with
the
balance
of
your
inhale
and
your
exhale
[
Music

allow
the
counting
to
fade
off
and
let
your
breath
return
to
its
natural
rhythm
and
flow
perhaps
noticing
that
your
breath
is
continuing
to
remain
balanced
now
with
a
relaxed
awareness
scan
through
your
body

simple
noticing

awareness
to
move
over
each
part
of
your
body
noticing
any
areas
that
if
possible
can
be
softened
and
released
obtention
see
if
you
can
do
this
with
as
little
effort
as
possible
[

do
your
best
to
let
go
of
any
expectations
of
what
you
think
you
might
sense
and
simply
feel
what
is
there
without
judgment
[
Music
]
as
you
continue
to
notice
the
sensations
connect
directly
to
what
you
are
feeling
rather
than
using
your
eyes
to
scan
and
see
the
body
[
Music
]
since
the
feelings
from
within
your
body
[
Music

whatever
you
're
feeling
is
okay
simply
observe
the
sensations
as
they
are
and
invite
in
a
sense
of
ease
in
your
body
you
may
find
that
the
simple
act
of
paying
attention
to
a
specific
body
part
allows
it
to
relax
and
let
go
in
a
moment
I
will
guide
you
through
a
relaxing
scan
of
your
body
moving
your
attention
strategically
throughout
your
body
to
ground
and
restore
your
energy
for
the
most
tranquil
experience

moves
through
the
areas
of
your
body
send
the
quality
of
love
to
each
area
your
body
knows
how
to
relax
and
sometimes
a
simple
invitation
to
do
so
is
all
that
it
takes
to
release
any
tension
pain
or
areas
of
gripping
and

the
intention
of
letting
go

you
feel

area

weight
of
anything

inner
strength
to

you

the
day
ahead
today
I
will
guide
you
into
complete
body
and
mind
relaxation
that
can
lead
you
into
a
deep
sleep

you
would
like

you
will
be
deeply
relaxed
before
we
get
started
make
sure
you
are
prepared
to
drift
off
to
sleep
when

is
over
if
you
would
like
take
a
moment
now
to
turn
off
all
distractions
you

pause
this
recording
if
you
like
if
there's
anything
you
need

night
's
sleep
know

you
are
safe
and
supported
and
you
can
awake
from
the
state
of
relaxation
at
any
time
if
you
choose
to
do
so
make
yourself
as
comfortable
as
you
can
close
your
eyes
and
settle
in
for
a
deep
productive
night
's
sleep
so
you
'll
wake
in
the
morning
feeling
rejuvenated
and
confident
to
start
your
day
somewhere
deep
inside
us
all
we
know
there
is
someone
trying
to
grow
to
the
surface
our
true
self
our
higher
self
when
we
delve
into
self
exploration
we
can
see
this
person
we
know
what
direction
we
want
to
go
for
some
of
us
the
missing
link
is
just
the
confidence
to
believe
in
ourselves
enough
to
take
action
the
confidence
to
live
our
life
in
alignment
with
what
is
truly
important
to
us
the
last
moments
before
sleep
are
so
important
to
us
they
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
how
we
start
our
next
day
when
we
wake
up
our
thoughts
pick
up
where
they
left
off
we
can
use
this
as
an
opportunity
to
give
us
the
best
chance
to
begin
our
day
with
a
positive
attitude
and
in
alignment
with
our
values
and
intentions
this
meditation
is
designed
to
help
you
drift
off
to
sleep
knowing
you
are
going
to
have
a
great
day
[
Music
]
confident
to
handle
all
that
comes
your
way
with
a
positive
intention
take
a
moment
before
we
begin
this
relaxation
process
to
set
an
intention
for
the
day
ahead
the
intention
can
be
anything
that
resonates
with
you
it
may
be
a
specific
quality
you
would
like
to
embody
more
in
your
life
or
an
emotion
you
'd
like
to
cultivate
maybe
you
would
like
to
focus
on
being
mindful
and
staying
in
the
present
moment
whatever
intention
is
calling
to
you
is
fine
[
Music
]
once
you
have
set
your
intention
bring
your
awareness
to
the
natural
rhythm
of
your
breath
at
first
simply
noticed
the
sensations
that
accompany
your
breath
maybe
you
feel
a
slightly
cool
sensation
as
the
air
passes
through
your
nostrils
maybe
you
feel
a
floating
sensation
as
your
abdomen
and
chest
rise
and
fill
with
breath
or
a
heaviness
as
the
air
moves
out
of
your
body
taking
any
attention
with
it
maybe
the
breath
brings
a
warming
sensation
to
the
body
as
it
travels
along
its
path
whatever
you
're
feeling
is
perfect
simply
observe
the
process
begin
to
count
the
length
of
your
breath
in
then
as
you
breathe
out
invite
the
exhale
to
be
one
count
longer
than
the
inhale
allow
each
exhale
to
carry
away
with
it
any
physical
and
emotional
stress
or
tension
by
exhaling
just
a
little
longer
than
you
inhale
your
breath
will
slow
your
body
and
mind
will
calm
down
in
response
breathe
in
this
way
for
a
few
more
cycles
then
allow
your
breath
to
return
to
its
natural
rhythm
[
Music
]
in
a
moment
I
will
guide
you
through
a
full
slow
body
scan
to
take
you
deeper
down
into
relaxation
your
body
knows
how
to
relax
and
sometimes
a
simple
invitation
to
do
so
is
all
that
it
takes
to
release
any
tension
pain
or
areas
of
gripping
[
Music

imagine
that
you
can
send
your
breath
to
any
area
in
your
body
and
the
breath
relaxes
that
area
and
make
space
for
the
energy
to
flow
freely
now
as
we
begin
to
scan
the
body
bring
your
attention
first
to
the
top
of
your
head
can
you
feel
this
area
from
the
inside
of
your
body
as
sensations
only
without
moving
your
eyes
as
you
scan
the
body
simply
move
your
awareness
to
each
part
and
relax
that
part
completely
[
Music
]
as
you
move
your
attention
throughout
the
body
you
will
scan
for
any
areas
of
tension
tightness
or
pain
and
if
you
find
areas
of
tension
stay
on
that
part
for
a
moment
and
send
your
breath
into
that
area
to
soften
it
invite
the
breath
to
wash
over
any
part
wash
away
any
tension
like
a
way
of
moving
over
your
body
[
Music
]
do
not
attach
to
the
feelings
of
your
body
simply
accept
them
as
they
are
in
this
moment
and
ask
your
body
to
relax
and
release
[
Music
]
as
you
continue
scanning
your
body
you
will
feel
this
relaxing
wave-like
energy
move
through
your
entire
body
and
it
takes
you
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
safe
and
supported
state
of
sleep
where
you
can
build
your
confidence
to
live
as
your
highest
self
[
Music

and
now
move
your
attention
from
the
top
of
your
head
down
to
your
forehead
and
feel
a
sense
of
softening
and
smoothing
[
Music

continue
to
relax
even
deeper
around
the
area
of
your
eyebrows
and
eyes
as
you
feel
the
tension
from
this
area
melt
away
your
entire
body
softens
a
little
further
[
Music
]
feel
your
eyelids
becoming
very
heavy
allow
your
cheeks
to
lengthen
down
and
let
go
part
your
teeth
unclench
your
jaw
and
relax
your
tongue
the
softening
of
your
face
and
jaw
will
deepen
the
relaxation
of
your
entire
body
[
Music
]
you
can
now
feel
your
throat
softening
notice
how
deep
and
calm
your
breath
has
become
as
you
continue
to
relax
deeper
and
deeper
allowing
this
wave
of
comfort
to
continue
its
journey
down
your
body
you
feel
your
chest
and
shoulders
release
and
rest
heavy
every
breath
in
oxygenate
the
body
to
promote
healing
and
recovery
from
your
day
now
allow
the
front
and
back
of
both
arms
to
relax
imagine
water
droplets
flowing
from
your
shoulders
down
your
arms
and
out
of
your
fingertips
taking
away
all
of
the
stress
and
tension
that
your
body
carries
since
the
relaxing
of
the
abdomen
as
it
sinks
down
into
the
surface
below
you
and
now
inviting
the
relaxation
to
continue
its
path
down
your
body
into
your
hips
and
lower
back
linger

hello

to
see
your

strengthening
as

drift
off

my
name
is
Jason
Stevenson
and
over
the
next
short
while
I
will
guide
you
into
a
greater
sense
of
peace
health
and
well-being
through
mindful
awareness
and
the
power
of
visualization
to
settle
into
this
practice
let
yourself
find
a
comfortable
lying
down
position
[

whether
on
your
back
or
on
your
side
ensure
that
the
spine
is
straight
and
your
heart
space
is
as
open
as
is
comfortable
let
your
arms
and
legs
soften
into
the
surface
beneath
you
and
if
you
haven't
already
done
so
just
closing
your
eyes
just
taking
a
moment
here
to
feel
into
the
bed

other
surface
that
supports
you
and
feeling
a
sense
of
gratitude
for
the
comforts
that
you
are
provided
with
[

[

as
remaining
closed
consider
the
roof
over
your
head
and
the
open
air
that
surrounds
you
now
visualize
this
open
air
as
it
becomes
the
breath
entering
into
your
nostrils
as
you
inhale
and
being
released
from
your
body
with
each
exhalation
as
you
breathe
mindfully
let
yourself
soften
further
into
the
earth
beneath
you
letting
all
unconscious
and
unnecessary
tension
begin
to
unravel
[
Music

as
your
body
melts
into
a
deeper
state
of
relaxation
the
presence
of
stress
hormones
begin
to
decline
and
the
immune
system
begins
to
strengthen
naturally
reflecting
the
symbiotic
relationship
between
mind
and
body
our
physical
well-being
improves
as
we
consciously
and
compassionately
invite
the
mind
into
this
present
moment
so
take
a
few
more
moments
now
to
witness
the
breath
as
it
flows
through
you
and
with
each
exhalation
let
your
bodies
surrender
more
completely
you
might
witness
and
soften
the
muscles
around
your
eyes
your
jaw
and
tongue
your
shoulders
and
arms
and
your
belly
or
any
other
part
of
you
that
feels
tense
in
the
same
way
that
relaxing
the
mind
promotes
physical
well-being
relaxing
the
physical
body
encourages
ease
and
release
of
the
mind
in
a
minute
or
two
we
will
begin
a
visual
journey
of
immune
system
strengthening
but
for
now
let
's
just
take
a
few
more
moments
to
deepen
the
body
's
relaxation
response
first
allow
all
the
air
in
your
lungs
gently
to
be
released
to
the
atmosphere
around
you
and
together
let
's
just
take
a
deep
full
breath
into
the
bottom
of
the
belly
and
then
slowly
let
it
back
out
another
long
deep
breath
in
and
when
you
're
ready
let
it
back
out
one
more
full
belly
reaching
breath
now
making
it
even
longer
this
time
and
once
you
've
reached
the
top
slowly
release
all
the
air
back
out
to
the
world
around
you
let
your
breath
come
back
to
its
natural
rhythm
now
as
you
mindfully
observe
it
for
just
a
few
more
moments
on
your
own
now
as
we
slowly
transition
into
our
visualization
take
a
moment
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
space
before
your
closed
eyes
though
the
mind
might
conjure
up
images
and
ideas
when
left
unchecked
an
open
space
of
unlimited
creative
potential
exists
before
the
mind
's
eye
when
we
slow
down
quiet
down
and
tune
in
and
it
is
upon
this
canvas
now
that
I
invite
you
to
imagine
yourself

on

overlooking
a
radiant
singing

glistens

take

moments
before
heading
on

feel
tired

on

moving
through

notice
what
is
here

if
there
is
any

those

your

it
weaves
its

quietly
through

the
rational
and
analytical
mind
as
it
guides
you
deeper
into
the
beauty
and
mystery
of
the
world
you
continued
on
for
a
short
while
until
a
path
appears
on
your
right-hand
side
as
if
silently
calling
you
towards
it
you
are
drawn
in
its
direction
and
so
deciding
to
venture
off
the
main
road
you
take
a
leap
of
faith
as
you
make
your
way
down
this
narrow
footpath
into
the
unknown
[
Music
]
as
you
meander
seemingly
aimlessly
you
note
that
your
body
begins
to
shift
shoulders
begin
to
soften
releasing
knots
of
tension
they
have
held
onto
for
quiet
some
time
now
your
belly
begins
to
relax
expanding
and
softening
with
each
full
deep
breath
your
eyes
begin
to
widen
taking
in
more
of
the
surroundings
than
they
are
accustomed
to
absorbing
and
your
jaw
begins
to
unclench
sinking
into
greater
comfort
and
ease
[
Music
]
your
feet
tread
lightly
as
if
kissing
the
earth
and
you
sense
yourself
coming
into
greater
alignment
with
the
natural
world
you
continue
on
for
some
time
taking
in
the
surroundings
through
open
eyes
is
mind
and
heart
great
big
beautiful
flowers
in
magenta
tangerine
and
lilac
tones
break
up
the
pervading
greenery
of
the
forest
meanwhile
your
ears
continue
to
absorb
the
sounds
of
the
nearby
creatures
frogs
now
chiming
in
alongside
the
cicadas
birds
and
monkeys
your
expanded
state
of
mind
takes
in
the
wonder
of
this
incredible
vibrant
space
reflecting
upon
how
healing
these
natural
ecosystems
are
how
can
it
be
you
wonder
that
we
have
yet
to
truly
learn
from
the
wisdom
of
these
natural
ecosystems
and
then
your
heart
fully
expanded
now
takes
in
the
love
and
beauty
of
this
rainforest
you
feel
an
immense
wave
of
gratitude
wash
through
this
loving
energy
center
and
so
you
silently
offer
a
word
of
thanks
to
the
natural
lands
you
move
across
you
thank
them
for
providing
you
with
just
the
sort
of
healing
you
had
yearned
for
[
Music
]
you
continued
on
a
little
while
further
until
another
path
comes
into
view
this
time
is
on
your
left-hand
side
and
is
even
narrower
than
the
one
you
are
on
your
intuition
tells
you
it
is
the
path
to
take
and
so
you
turn
down
with
confidence
and
curiosity
the
path
weaves
in
and
out
of
the
tropical
trees
bringing
you
into
even
a
closer
contact
with
its
wonder
the
broad
leaves
are
close
enough
that
they
nearly
brush
your
cheeks
leaving
you
for
a
moment
to
question
if
you
are
going
the
right
way
and
yet
just
as
you
begin
to
doubt
the
path
you
've
chosen
something
opens
up
to
you
it
is
a
small
clearing
in
the
forest
in
the
center
of
it
an
elderly
woman
stands
gazing
up
at
the
branches
of
the
surrounding
trees
she
's
dressed
in
a
long
burnt
orange
dress
and
is
wrapped
in
a
loosely
knit
Shore
the
silver
braided
hair
is
wrapped
in
front
of
her
left
shoulder
and
as
she
stands
there
it
seems
as
if
she
is
whispering
to
the
trees
and
then
listening
and
whispering
and
then
listening
[
Music
]
you
cough
quietly
to
let
her
know
you
were
here
completely
unstart
'old
by
your
presence
she
turns
to
you
slowly
and
welcomes
you
with
a
warm
smile
you
make
your
way
towards
her
and
she
invites
you
to
sit
down
on
a
long
bench
in
the
center
of
the
clearing
she
sits
next
to
you
and
asks
what
brings
you
here
you
begin
to
tell
her
that
what
you
longed
for
is
a
greater
sense
of
health
and
well-being
particularly
in
the
area
of
immunity
you
yearn
for
a
system
that
is
strong
and
resilient
and
you
believe
that
perhaps
this
rainforest
might
hold
what
you
need
she
embraces
every
word
you
speak
and
lets
you
know
that
it
is
possible
to
invite
greater
balance
into
your
body
through
any
and
all
acts
of
self-care
including
through
the
words
and
images
you
hold
in
your
mind
she
invites
you
to
begin
by
taking
a
dip
in
the
healing
blue
lagoon
just
a
short
walk
from
her
sacred
circle
and
upon
your
return
she
will
have
concocted
an
herbal
tea
that
will
heal
and
balance
your
body
and
enhance
its
immunity
you
take
her
advice
and
follow
the
pathway
she
points
you
towards
veering
down
a
small
hill
and
around
a
few
more
bends
in
the
path
you
soon
arrived
at
a
break
in
the
treeline
we
're
turquoise
waters
reflect
back
at
you
from
a
short
distance
a
small
set
of
stairs
guide
you
down
towards
the
water
's
edge
and
as
you
step
off
the
final
stair
you
take
a
moment
to
absorb
the
fullness
of
this
landscape
you
have
never
seen
water
so
bright
so
clear
so
radiant
after
preparing
to
head
into
these
cool
and
cleansing
waters
you
inch
your
way
slowly
into
the
lagoon
the
water
moves
gently
up
your
body
until
soon
it
has
reached
your
waist
you
went
to
the
water
to
as
comfortable
as
you
possibly
can
and
if
you
choose
to
dunking
your
head
under
the
water
and
up
again
[
Music
]
the
Sun
is
still
high
in
the
sky
beaming
down
on
you
from
its
steady
place
there
[
Music
]
you
close
your
eyes
and
surrender
to
the
lagoon
knowing
that
it
will
support
you
you
take
a
full
deep
breath
in
and
as
you
exhale
you
envision
all
heaviness
or
constriction
and
all
imbalances
leaving
your
body
you
take
another
full
breath
in
and
exhaling
once
again
you
envision
yourself
releasing
all
the
thoughts
all
the
ideas
and
all
the
physical
imbalances
that
inhibit
you
from
experiencing
radiant
health
[
Music
]
and
now
that
space
has
been
created
within
you
for
the
new
you
consciously
let
your
next
inhalation
fill
you
with
the
sun
's
healing
energy
it
enters
your
lungs
is
a
warm
golden
glow
cleansing
this
part
of
the
body
's
defense
system
completely
then
as
the
sun
's
golden
light
seeps
further
into
your
body
it
cleanses
and
brings
balance
to
your
lymphatic
system
your
spleen
your
thymus
your
white
blood
cells
and
all
other
parts
of
your
body's
immune
system
[
Music
]
as
it
spreads
through
you
from
within
it
continues
to
penetrate
you
from
the
outside
as
the
Sun
continues
to
beat
down
on
your
bare
skin
[
Music
]
you
spend
a
few
more
moments
here
soaking
up
the
healing
energy
of
the
Sun
off
the
breath
and
of
the
water
you
rest
in
knowing
that
only
when
all
systems
and
elements
are
healthy
can
we
experience
true
health
and
vitality
[
Music
]
when
you
were
ready
you
slowly
make
your
way
back
towards
the
shore
drying
yourself
off
with
the
towel
and
preparing
to
head
back
your
entire
body
feels
light
and
free
full
to
the
brim
with
energy
and
vitality
you
take
the
small
pathway
back
to
where
you
encountered
the
wise
woman
before
she
awaits
your
return
with
a
fresh
cup
of
a
hot
herbal
tea
the
two
of
you
hold
silence
as
you
bow
your
head
and
accept
the
mug
she
extends
to
you
and
as
you
let
the
warm
immune-boosting
liquid
flow
through
you
you
trust
that
you
already
have
and
continue
to
come
back
into
balance
to
come
back
to
your
innate
capacity
for
strength
vitality
and
resilience
you
pass
back
the
empty
mug
and
thank
this
woman
for
the
blessings
she
has
bestowed
upon
you
and
before
you
leave
she
reminds
you
to
make
sure
that
you
prioritize
your
rest
in
the
days
and
years
to
come
rest
of
both
body
and
mind
she
says
is
one
of
the
most
underrated
and
yet
most
important
factors
of
a
healthy
internal
defense
system
you
smile
thanking
her
once
more
and
then
you
slowly
head
back
in
the
direction
of
your
very
own
tree
house
first
you
navigate
your
way
down
the
narrow
rainforest
encroaching
pathway
towards
the
wider
footpath
then
you
follow
this
wider
path
until
you
arrive
at
the
main
road
and
the
main
road
guides
you
back
to
the
pathway
up
to
your
heart
and
before
you
know
it
you
were
resting
on
the
hammock
that
swings
on
your
balcony
your
entire
body
rests
with
ease
and
yet
you
can
feel
the
awakened
empowered
energy
that
flows
through
you
[
Music
]
you
remember
the
healing
light
of
the
Sun
that
entered
your
lungs
as
you
floated
in
the
turquoise
lagoon
and
you
sense
its
presence
still
within
you
and
visioning
yourself
glowing
from
within
just
a
few
final
moments
and
for
just
a
few
more
final
moments
imagine
the
golden
light
of
the
Sun
spreads
through
your
entire
being
and
as
you
slowly
release
the
image
of
a
healing
glow
within
you
also
begin
to
dissolve
the
imagery
of
the
rainforest
[
Music

[

coming
back
to
the
surface
that
supports
you
in
this
reality
whether
that
be
a
bed
a
couch
or
something
else
you
ground
yourself
affirmative
ly
back
into
this
present
moment
notice
the
innate
flow
of
your
breath
now
continuing
to
nourish
and

will
experience
a
life
of
peace
free
of
worry
now
i
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
take
a
moment
and
make
sure
your
environment
is
all
set
for
you
to
safely
drift
into
sleep
settle
into
comfort
for
the
night
close
your
eyes
and
let
this
be
a
signal
to
your
body
to
let
go
as
your
eyes
close
and
you
turn
off
the
outside
world
you
can
invite
your
body
to
release
any
obvious
tension
or
tightness
perhaps
soften
the
muscles
in
and
around
your
eyes
unclench
your
jaw
and
welcome
this
release
to
travel
down
your
body
relaxing
your
neck
and
shoulders
next
let
your
chest
open
[
Music
]
and
your
belly
soften
welcome
the
heaviness
of
the
relaxed
state
of
your
legs
letting
go
completely
into
the
surface
below
you
sense
any
remaining
tension
from
your
day
being
released
through
the
bottom
of
your
feet
to
allow
you
to
safely
let
go
into
tranquility
become
aware
of
where
your
body
makes
contact
with
the
surface
below
you
let
this
point
of
contact
ground
you
[
Music
]
feel
this
as
support
[
Music
]
and
allow
yourself
to
be
fully
supported
you
are
safe
you
can
trust
in
the
universe
use
this
sensation
of
where
you
and
your
support
meet
to
draw
your
awareness
gradually
from
your
outer
experience
to
your
inner
world
[
Music
]
notice
without
judgment
what
your
physical
sensations
are
in
this
moment
your
body
has
the
amazing
ability
to
cope
with
challenges
and
to
grow
stronger
from
them
if
you
allow
and
let
go
of
resistance
it
is
okay
to
befriend
the
fear
that
shows
up
for
you
fear
is
not
the
enemy
it
is
a
helpful
and
necessary
emotion
when
it
is
channeled
correctly
as
you
continue
to
relax
physically
even
deeper
allow
your
attention
to
move
inward
to
rest
easily
on
your
breath
notice
the
air
as
it
goes
in
and
out
through
your
nose
feel
your
breath
from
within
as
it
comes
in
and
as
it
goes
out
like
an
ocean
wave
rolling
into
shore
and
back
out
again
[
Music
]
your
attention
on
the
wave
of
your
breath
will
aid
in
deepening
your
peaceful
state
and
allow
sleep
to
easily
come
to
you
without
any
effort
during
any
moments
of
silence
if
you
find
your
mind
wandering
bring
your
attention
back
to
your
breath
perhaps
you
may
feel
your
stomach
rise
or
your
ribs
expand
as
you
breathe
naturally
or
you
may
notice
the
feel
of
air
passing
through
your
nostrils
whatever
draws
your
attention
[
Music
]
about
your
natural
breath
let
your
attention
easily
linger
here
for
another
moment
[

so
[
Music

while
there
are
many
things
in
life
that
you
do
n't
have
control
over
your
breath
is
one
aspect
that
you
can
direct
a
little
bit
to
continue
relaxing
and
letting
go
even
deeper
invite
your
breath
to
lengthen
begin
to
deepen
your
inhale
for
the
next
few
cycles
of
breath
and
on
your
next
exhalation
release
all
the
air
completely
letting
go
letting
go
letting
go
this
full
exhale
will
prepare
your
lungs
to
receive
your
next
inhale
each
deep
inhale
brings
in
fresh
oxygen
each
full

releases
the

each

cycle
is
cleansing
and
healing
you
with
each
passing
exhale
you
can
say
in
your

letting

of
air
takes
with

when

is

your

will
continue

and
relaxing
like
your

slowing
down
your

too
can
slow

in

to

your

and
your

the

remain

may
still
have

going
through

that
's
okay
notice
them
from

as
if
you
are
an
observer
and
invite
the
space
between

to
extend
just

your

with
yourself

will
first
bring
your
awareness
to
that
part
noticing
how
it
feels
without

you
will
relax

flows
out

down
your

releases
out
of
your

through
your

the

of
your

as
the
sensation

heaviness
washes
over
you

in
order
to
make
room
for
new
and
positive
beliefs
in
your

you
must
first
let
go
of
old
outdated
beliefs
that
have
been
holding
you
back
and
now
just
like
the
trees
let
go
of
their
leaves
in
autumn
let
go
of
any
negative
thoughts
or
beliefs
that
do
not
serve
you
let
go

any
past
negativities
so
that
you
can
replace
them
with
positive
thoughts

gratitude
see
those
leaves
falling
from
the
tree
branches
representing
any
limiting
beliefs
they
easily
fall
to
the
ground
to
make
room
for
new
healthy
leaves
to
grow
in
their
place
when
spring
comes
believe
that
you
are
strong

can
see
your
limiting

disappear

fear
are
things
of

no

need
to
have
the
beliefs
that
have
been
getting
in
your
way
and
once
you
see
all
of
these
leaves
falling
to
the
ground
imagine
a
strong
wind
blowing
those
leaves
out
of
your
sight
never
to
affect
you
negatively
again

that
you
have

for

ones
to
be
adopted
you
will
hear
me
speak

who
ultimately
decides

whether

you

that
was

any

stumbling

patch

bittersweet
in

garden
this

an
invasive
species

can
choke
out
the

simply
view
it

something
to
take
care

to
remove

Guided
Meditation
To
Learn
Faster
A
New
Skill
Learning
something
new
represents
a
challenge
as
we
know
we
will
be
forced
to
leave
our
comfort
zone
.
Sometimes
we
pass
on
learning
something
new
because
we
fear
we
could
n't
“
get
it
right
”
;
it
’
s
just
too
hard
or
will
take
too
much
time
.
However
,
there
are
times
when
learning
something
new
is
easy
and
exciting
in
the
beginning
,
but
as
we
dive
deeper
into
the
skill
,
frustrations
may
emerge
.
The
frustration
barrier
doesn
’
t
just
make
learning
more
difficult
;
it
is
also
demotivating
.
When
you
face
the
barrier
repeatedly
,
you
may
start
to
believe
that
you
are
not
born
with
the
talents
necessary
to
succeed
in
the
particular
skill
you
are
trying
to
learn
.
Whether
it
be
learning
how
to
code
,
drawing
,
play
a
new
sport
or
business
,
there
’
s
no
skill
that
you
can
’
t
acquire
.
In
this
meditation
,
we
will
grow
your
mental
capacity
to
learn
faster
,
memorize
more
,
and
keep
yourself
motivated
.
It
is
recommended
to
do
this
meditation
every
time
before
practice
your
new
desired
skill
to
maximize
your
learning
potential
.
Let
's
begin
Find
a
quiet
place
where
you
can
lay
down
or
sit
in
a
comfortable
position
without
being
disturbed
.
Allow
your
eyelids
to
close
over
your
eyes
softly
.
Slowly
take
a
deep
breath
in
...
hold
for
a
moment
and
slowly
let
the
breath
all
the
way
out
.
Take
a
few
more
deep
breaths
.
Gently
all
the
way
in
-
pause
and
slowly
,
all
the
way
out
.
On
every
exhale
,
your
body
relaxes
more
and
more
.
As
you
focus
on
my
voice
,
your
mind
calms
down
and
opens
to
the
positive
suggestions
of
becoming
very
good
at
a
desired
new
skill
.
Now
,
I
would
like
you
to
call
to
mind
a
skill
you
already
have
and
are
good
at
.
It
can
be
driving
a
car
or
a
bicycle
.
Maybe
,
cooking
,
work
,
or
business-related
.
Anything
that
comes
to
your
mind
.
In
your
mind
's
eye
,
visualize
yourself
practicing
this
skill
.
Take
a
few
moments
to
enjoy
it
.
How
does
it
feel
doing
something
that
you
are
good
at
?
Remember
the
time
when
you
learned
that
skill
.
When
was
it
?
How
did
you
learn
it
?
Was
it
easy
or
hard
?
Take
notes
on
how
you
feel
knowing
that
you
pass
a
long
way
to
learn
that
skill
,
and
you
are
here
,
now
enjoying
it
.
Proud
of
it
.
Now
,
I
would
like
you
to
call
to
mind
the
skill
you
want
to
develop
.
It
could
be
one
that
you
find
particularly
challenging
.
It
could
be
a
skill
that
you
have
been
trying
to
acquire
for
some
time
.
Take
a
moment
and
visualize
yourself
practicing
this
skill
.
Zoom-in
on
the
details
.
What
do
you
feel
?
If
you
sense
any
frustration
or
anxiety
emerging
,
take
a
deep
inhale
,
and
as
you
exhale
,
let
it
go
.
Now
,
I
would
like
you
to
find
a
connection
between
your
desired
skill
and
the
one
you
already
acquire
.
The
connection
does
not
have
to
be
a
direct
one
.
Take
a
moment
to
find
a
connection
,
small
or
big
.
As
your
mind
bridges
the
gap
between
the
two
skills
,
visualize
yourself
practicing
the
new
desired
skill
with
the
same
confidence
and
pleasure
you
practice
the
skill
you
already
possess
.
See
yourself
improving
and
getting
better
and
better
.
It
’
s
becoming
too
easy
.
This
skill
can
not
be
taken
away
.
This
skill
is
a
part
of
you
.
Notice
all
there
is
to
notice
,
from
your
breath
to
your
posture
and
how
you
feel
.
Allow
yourself
to
relish
in
this
moment
of
victory
.
You
may
sense
the
corners
of
your
mouth
curl
up
into
a
smile
.
You
may
even
jump
up
in
celebration
in
your
mind
's
eye
.
And
as
you
celebrate
getting
good
at
your
new
skill
,
repeat
the
following
affirmation
in
your
mind
.
My
brain
can
easily
contain
a
lot
of
information
.
I
can
learn
anything
I
choose
to
.
I
’
m
finding
learning
new
things
easy
and
fun
.
I
believe
in
myself
and
my
abilities
.
I
have
a
great
memory
.
My
desire
to
learn
new
things
increases
daily
.
I
am
always
motivated
to
learn
new
things
.
I
am
a
naturally
smart
and
intelligent
person
.
I
have
full
confidence
in
my
learning
abilities
.
Let
yourself
feel
a
sense
of
fulfillment
.
Take
a
moment
to
thank
yourself
for
showing
up
to
your
practice
and
taking
the
time
to
develop
a
skill
that
you
truly
desire
.
Stay
in
this
sense
of
gratitude
for
a
few
more
moments
,
the
gratitude
for
learning
a
new
skill
,
your
ability
,
and
your
mindset
.
When
you
are
ready
,
slowly
come
back
to
your
physical
body
.
Wiggle
the
fingers
and
toes
.
At
your
own
pace
,
open
the
eyes
.

begin
by
letting
yourself
get
into
whatever
position
feels
best
to
you
[
Music
]
and
when
you
're
ready
softly
close
your
beautiful
eyes
and
tune
your
awareness
inwards
focusing
on
your
breath
and
your
body
letting
your
belly
be
soft
and
loose
if
it
's
not
already
there
's
nothing
to
hold
on
to
here
allow
any
muscles
you
do
not
need
to
use
right
now
to
become
slack
and
relaxed
feel
how
the
air
flows
naturally
in
and
out
without
you
having
to
try
or
do
anything
your
only
role
is
to
allow
your
only
role
is
to
allow
let
the
feeling
behind
that
sentence
seep
in
you
only
rule
is
to
allow
what
do
you
wish
to
allow
love
joy
prosperity
peace
on
the
planet
whatever
you
wish
to
allow
you
must
first
line
up
with
feel
within
you
and
then
allow
it
to
flow
through
you
allow
it
to
fuel
you
what
do
you
wish
to
line
up
with
today
identify
the
emotion
you
wish
to
feel
and
generate
it
within
you
right
now
you
may
surprise
yourself
at
how
easily
it
begins
to
come
identify
where
you
first
feel
it
perhaps
to
begin
you
had
a
thought
come
to
mind
that
gives
you
the
feeling
you
do
not
need
to
continue
to
think
about
anything
but
rather
continue
to
focus
on
the
feeling
watch
as
the
feeling
grows
let
your
focus
on
this
feeling
be
all
you
need
right
now
and
if
your
mind
does
wander
that's
perfectly
okay
simply
return
your
focus
to
the
feeling
again
over
and
over
continually
coming
back
to
how
good
this
feels
with
no
other
motive
than
to
give
yourself
the
gift
of
feeling
this
way
now
is
n't
that
enough
do
n't
you
deserve
to
there
need
not
be
any
other
reason
any
other
motivation
than
to
give
yourself
the
gift
of
lining
up
with
feeling
good
watch
now
as
the
feeling
continues
to
grow
[
Music

perhaps
thoughts
of
affirmation
start
to
trickle
in
if
this
happens
allow
only
redirect
if
the
thoughts
seem
to
drift
from
the
feeling
you're
experiencing
to
refocus
on
the
feeling
otherwise
you
may
notice
thoughts
begin
to
pop
up
that
line
up
with
the
feeling
that
perhaps
even
enhance
the
feeling
allow
those
revel
in
those
enjoy
the
feelings
i
will
leave
you
alone
now
for
a
few
minutes
to
continue
to
practice
this
and
enjoy
this
trust
and
know
whatever
you
experience
is
right
for
you
and
you
can
only
get

Awaken
Your
Intuition
|10
Minute
Guided
Meditation
To
Enhance
Your
Inner
Voice
Your
intuition
is
the
heart
of
your
soul
.
It
connects
you
to
a
higher
intelligence
that
protects
you
and
guides
you
.
It
knows
everything
you
want
in
this
lifetime
.
And
,
it
knows
how
to
get
you
there
.
All
you
need
to
do
is
quiet
the
mind
,
ask
a
question
,
and
listen
to
your
heart
.
This
meditation
will
guide
you
to
tap
into
your
intuition
’
s
infinite
wisdom
and
transform
your
life
in
a
magical
way
.
Begin
by
finding
a
comfortable
position
sitting
or
laying
down
.
When
you
are
ready
,
gently
close
your
eyes
and
let
out
a
deep
breath
.
Exhale
all
that
you
have
been
carrying
around
with
you
throughout
the
day
.
This
is
a
new
moment
.
Leave
everything
else
in
the
past
and
bring
your
awareness
to
this
moment
.
As
you
inhale
through
the
nose
,
slowly
follow
your
breath
as
it
travels
from
your
nostrils
,
down
your
throat
,
and
into
your
lungs
.
Feel
the
air
expand
and
fill
up
your
entire
chest
.
And
as
you
exhale
,
focus
on
the
steady
stream
of
air
that
comes
from
out
of
your
body
.
Keep
focusing
on
your
breathe
a
few
more
moments
,
and
let
your
body
fully
relax
.
Anytime
you
notice
your
thoughts
wandering
off
,
bring
yourself
back
to
the
present
moment
by
focusing
on
your
breathing
.
You
are
safe
here
.
Surrender
to
this
moment
.
Now
,
we
are
going
deeper
into
relaxation
.
Bring
your
attention
to
your
feet
.
Imagine
warm
energy
slowly
pouring
over
your
feet
and
going
up
to
your
legs
.
Feel
how
all
the
tension
is
leaving
your
feet
and
legs
.
Visualize
the
energy
going
up
to
your
torso
.
Feel
your
lower
body
getting
heavier
and
heavier
.
As
the
energy
goes
up
,
it
relaxes
your
stomach
,
chest
,
shoulders
,
arms
,
neck
.
Imagine
this
energy
like
a
blanket
that
melts
and
hugs
your
entire
body
.
Feel
your
body
as
it
’
s
pulled
by
gravity
,
sinking
deeper
into
the
surface
beneath
you
.
Feel
the
energy
going
up
and
loosen
all
your
face
muscles
.
Allow
this
relaxing
feeling
to
release
all
the
tension
from
your
body
.
From
this
place
of
full
relaxation
,
shift
your
attention
to
the
space
between
your
eyebrows
.
This
is
your
third
eye
chakra
.
It
is
the
place
where
your
soul
meets
your
physical
body
.
It
also
provides
the
wisdom
necessary
to
access
truth
beyond
time
and
space
.
Imagine
a
single
point
of
purple
energy
penetrating
the
space
between
your
eyebrows
.
Visualize
the
purply
energy
going
deeper
into
your
skull
.
Extend
that
energy
outwards
as
well
,
and
imagine
the
purple
light
beaming
out
of
your
third
eye
.
Feel
the
tingling
sensation
as
you
bring
focused
attention
to
this
area
.
You
may
also
feel
a
buzz
of
powerful
energy
all
around
your
forehead
.
Go
deeper
into
the
sensation
as
you
connect
to
your
intuition
center
.
Now
,
think
about
an
area
of
your
life
that
you
would
like
guidance
or
clarity
on
and
form
a
question
that
could
shed
light
on
it
.
Ask
for
the
answer
to
be
revealed
to
you
.
Be
open
to
any
information
you
receive
.
Notice
any
thoughts
that
arise
.
Avoid
censoring
your
thoughts
or
processing
them
with
your
rational
mind
.
Just
observe
what
comes
up
without
overthinking
about
it
.
Even
if
things
don
’
t
seem
to
make
sense
or
the
answers
feel
incomplete
,
just
note
everything
that
comes
up
without
judgment
.
If
it
feels
right
to
do
so
,
ask
additional
questions
,
one
at
a
time
.
But
,
do
not
force
the
answers
.
If
you
still
feel
that
you
need
more
information
,
let
it
come
to
you
.
Know
that
your
intuition
will
communicate
to
you
in
perfect
timing
.
Your
intuition
has
heard
you
,
and
the
answers
will
come
.
With
this
understanding
,
relax
your
mind
and
focus
on
the
space
between
your
eyebrows
once
again
.
Take
three
deep
breaths
.
With
each
inhale
,
breathe
in
light
.
With
each
exhale
,
breathe
out
worry
and
fear
.
Repeat
these
affirmations
either
out
loud
or
in
your
head
:
I
trust
myself
and
the
voice
that
speaks
within
me
.
All
that
I
need
to
know
at
this
moment
is
revealed
to
me
.
I
am
always
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
.
My
intuition
effortlessly
guides
me
.
My
intuition
guides
me
to
everything
that
is
meant
for
me
.
I
am
wise
,
intuitive
,
and
connected
to
my
inner
guidance
.
I
am
one
with
the
highest
intelligence
that
guides
my
soul
.
Take
one
last
deep
breath
and
wiggle
your
fingers
and
toes
to
bring
awareness
back
to
your
body
.
Shake
your
arms
and
legs
gently
.
Gently
open
your
eyes
and
bring
your
awareness
back
to
your
surroundings
.

's
okay
be
relaxed
do
what
comes
naturally
to
you
let
's
begin
by
becoming
completely
aware
of
our
own
physical
body
we
will
begin
at
your
toes
be
aware
of
their
presence
but
let
them
be
totally
and
completely
relaxed
visualize
each
toe
begin
with
your
little
toe
and
move
centrally
one
by
one
to
the
big
toe
let
them
relax
feel
the
tension
of
the
day
flow
out
of
your
body
through
your
toes
just
relax
now
mentally
move
up
along
the
course
of
your
body
acknowledging
the
resting
position
of
your
feet
we
often
carry
stress
in
our
feet
they
serve
to
carry
our
bodies
through
the
physical
world
let
them
simply
relax
completely
and
totally
now
we
continue
to
move
upward
to
our
lower
extremities
the
legs
and
the
thighs
these
are
large
muscle
groups
that
work
hard
throughout
the
day
to
transport
us

them
a
rest
let
them
sink
into
the
chair
of
bed

go

the
muscles

muscle
fibres

be
aware

your
buttocks
and
pelvis

often
hold
stress
here
as
well
relax
free
yourself
of
the
tension
you
Harbor
here
let
your
pelvic
floor
relax
and
release
this
is
a
wonderful
feeling
proceed
upward
to
your
core
the
abdominal
region
in
the
low
back
these
are
areas

often
work
hard
to
strengthen
and
tighten
now
is
a
time
to
let
them
be
loose
and
free
of
strain

your

any
air
trapped
at
the
basis
of
your
lungs
think
of
how
cleansing
this
form
of
breathing
is
simply

the
time
to
relax
and
breathe

stay
in
the
moment

intent
here
is
not

goal
is
to
be
living
fully
in
the
moment
in
acceptance
of
your
body
and
yourself

force
of
nature

a
powerful
experience

stress
and
tension

remaining

area

everything
on

superficial
level
before

much
time
getting
too
deep
in
any

area
of

I

Welcome
to
SoothingPod
’
s
meditation
.
In
today
’
s
meditation
,
we
will
be
exploring
what
it
means
to
be
creative
,
as
well
as
how
we
can
better
express
ourselves
with
courage
.
And
,
what
does
it
take
to
colour
outside
the
lines
?
Before
we
dive
into
this
exploration
,
take
a
moment
to
tune
into
this
present
moment
by
bringing
yourself
to
a
comfortable
seated
position
.
Gently
elongate
the
spine
,
neck
included
,
and
then
allow
your
arms
to
rise
up
overhead
for
a
momentary
stretch…
…
and
then
release
them
back
down
to
rest
on
the
thighs
,
the
knees
,
or
in
your
lap
.
Draw
your
attention
now
to
the
breath
,
mindfully
watching
the
path
it
takes
from
the
outer
world
to
the
inner…
and
then
back
out
again
.
Notice
your
breaths
current
rhythm
and
depth
as
you
begin
to
settle
more
comfortably
into
this
space
.
With
every
mindful
breath
we
take
,
the
racing
mind
softens
and
we
become
more
receptive
to
whatever
is
here
right
now
.
Continuing
to
breathe
mindfully
,
expand
your
awareness
to
include
any
other
sensations
you
might
be
experiencing
.
Perhaps
you
notice
a
tingling
sensation…
a
tightness…
a
softening…
or
an
expansion
.
Whatever
is
the
case
for
you
right
now
,
simply
witness
each
sensation
without
any
judgment
,
inviting
the
breath
deep
into
any
areas
of
tension
if
discomfort
is
present
.
Inhale
a
sense
of
nourishment
and
inspiration…
…
and
exhale
all
tension
,
all
fear
,
and
any
discomfort
that
might
be
present
.
If
you
feel
completely
at
ease
in
this
moment
already
,
simply
continue
to
watch
the
breath
move
through
you
,
cleansing
you
as
it
does
so
.
Take
just
a
few
more
breaths
in
silence
,
releasing
any
rising
thoughts
with
each
exhalation
.
Creativity
is
often
believed
to
be
something
exclusive
to
people
such
as
painters
,
poets
,
and
playwrights
.
And
while
these
people
do
tend
to
embody
a
high
degree
of
creativity
,
the
essence
of
creativity
is
something
much
broader
than
this
.
Creativity
is
the
use
of
imagination
or
inventiveness
to
create
something
new
and
original
,
and
by
this
definition
,
creativity
is
something
that
all
of
us
embody
.
Whether
on
paper
or
canvas
,
or
in
our
homes
and
relationships
,
creativity
expresses
itself
in
numerous
ways
.
In
the
words
of
writer
Elizabeth
Gilbert
,
“
If
you
’
re
alive
,
you
’
re
a
creative
person.
”
Creativity
is
required
to
navigate
complicated
relationships
,
just
as
much
as
it
’
s
needed
to
compose
a
great
piece
of
music
.
Of
course
these
are
very
different
examples
of
the
use
of
creativity
,
but
at
the
core
of
them
,
they
require
the
same
things
:
courage
,
confidence
,
and
a
willingness
to
step
beyond
the
familiar
.
To
be
creative
,
we
need
to
be
willing
to
make
mistakes
–
to
be
willing
to
colour
outside
of
the
lines
.
Through
mistakes
,
we
learn
.
Through
colouring
beyond
our
boundaries
,
we
discover
we
are
capable
of
far
more
than
we
had
previously
imagined
.
So
,
take
a
moment
now
to
return
to
your
breath
,
silently
inviting
your
innate
capacity
for
creativity
to
rise
to
the
surface
.
Now
,
silently
repeat
the
words
:
My
imagination
has
no
bounds
.
I
honour
my
unique
expression
of
creativity
.
I
am
willing
to
draw
outside
of
the
lines
.
Continuing
to
breathe
slowly
and
steadily
,
with
these
affirmations
lingering
in
mind
,
notice
how
it
feels
to
honour
the
creative
energy
within
your
being
.
And
,
if
the
mind
intervenes
to
deny
your
embodiment
of
creativity
,
gently
invite
these
self-limiting
beliefs
into
the
heart
for
healing
and
release
.
When
it
comes
to
creativity
,
it
is
not
possible
to
compare
ourselves
to
any
standards
we
might
hold
.
Our
creative
energy
and
potential
is
unique
to
who
we
are
as
individuals
.
Take
another
deep
breath
in
,
all
the
way
to
the
base
of
the
belly…
And
as
you
exhale
,
release
any
fears
,
any
limitations
,
or
any
standards
you
might
hold
for
yourself
in
relation
to
creativity
.
Gently
allow
the
heart
space
to
open
wider
on
your
next
inhalation
,
inviting
your
courage
and
confidence
to
rise
alongside
your
creativity
.
Take
just
a
few
more
slow
and
steady
breaths
now
,
silently
honouring
your
unique
creative
potential
.
Observe
the
natural
ebb
and
flow
of
one
more
breath…
…
and
then
shift
your
attention
back
to
your
physical
presence
in
this
room
.
When
you
are
ready
,
gently
open
your
eyes
.
I
hope
you
enjoyed
today
’
s
meditation
.
See
you
again

if
it
's
comfortable
for
you
let
's
begin
by
taking
a
gentle
deep
breath
in
through
the
nose
and
out
through
the
mouth
and
with
that
exhalation
adopting
a
comfortable
posture
of
awareness
returning
the
breath
to
its
natural
rhythm
and
allowing
your
attention
to
gently
drop
into
this
present
moment
and
without
turning
or
looking
around
just
lightly
bringing
into
your
awareness
all
that
's
in
your
surrounding
space
and
with
your
next
out
breath
allowing
your
focus
to
fall
onto
one
specific
object
that
's
in
your
field
of
vision
and
it
's
not
an
intense
stare
so
just
maintaining
it
as
a
very
soft
focus
and
this
is
a
gentle
practice
so
if
at
any
point
the
eyes
become
fatigued
allowing
yourself
to
gently
close
them
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
reopening
them
nice
and
easy
noticing
as
any
thoughts
come
and
go
and
just
returning
the
attention
back
to
your
object
and
now
letting
the
focus
zoom
back
out
again
being
aware
of
your
surroundings
perhaps
blinking
a
few
times
allowing
this
cultivated
focus
to
follow
you
into
your
next
activity

you
Welcome
to
Soothing
Pod
’
s
meditation
.
In
this
session
,
we
’
ll
explore
the
ways
our
meditation
practice
can
help
us
better
enjoy
who
we
are
and
what
we
do
.
Begin
by
finding
a
quiet
place
to
sit
.
Gently
close
your
eyes
,
and
let
your
spine
lengthen
.
As
you
sit
up
tall
,
release
any
unnecessary
tension
so
that
you
stay
alert
yet
relaxed
.
And
as
you
start
to
settle
in
,
take
a
few
deep
breaths
.
As
you
exhale
,
let
go
of
any
expectations
you
have
for
your
practice
.
Let
go
of
commitments
for
the
rest
of
your
day
.
And
set
aside
whatever
you
don
’
t
need
at
this
moment
.
Now
,
turn
towards
your
breath
.
Soft
,
smooth
inhales
and
exhales
.
There
’
s
no
need
to
shape
or
control
your
breath
.
Instead
,
notice
its
natural
flow
.
Observe
your
breath
’
s
length
.
Notice
its
depth…
its
temperature
.
Just
let
your
breath
be
as
it
is
,
and
stay
present
from
the
start
of
each
inhalation
to
the
end
of
each
exhalation
.
As
you
breathe
in
,
watch
the
breath
moving
through
your
nostrils
...
your
ribs
expanding
...
your
belly
rising
.
As
you
breathe
out
,
follow
the
movement
of
your
belly
releasing
,
your
ribs
gently
contracting
,
and
your
breath
moving
out
of
your
nostrils
again
.
Stay
with
the
whole
cycle
of
your
breath
,
noticing
your
whole
body
breathing
with
you
.
And
now
,
invoke
a
sense
of
appreciation
for
your
breath
.
As
you
observe
each
cycle
,
enjoy
the
wave
of
your
breath
.
Notice
the
freshness
of
each
inhale
.
The
soft
ease
of
the
exhales
.
And
when
your
mind
inevitably
wanders
,
drop
any
judgments
or
labels
,
and
bring
your
attention
back
to
your
breath
once
more
.
Tap
into
the
ebb
and
flow
of
your
breath
with
kindness
and
appreciation
.
Now
,
allow
your
awareness
to
soften
.
Have
you
ever
stopped
to
ask
yourself
if
you
like
the
person
that
you
are
and
the
life
that
you
’
ve
created
?
Regardless
of
what
your
life
looks
like
,
it
can
be
exhausting
to
live
in
a
world
where
we
don
’
t
like
who
we
are
or
what
we
do
.
And
no
matter
how
hard
we
work
or
how
many
goals
we
manage
to
reach
,
we
’
ll
never
feel
truly
content
until
we
learn
to
accept
,
to
like
,
and
eventually
to
love
who
we
are
.
Liking
ourselves
isn
’
t
about
landing
our
ideal
job
,
living
in
our
dream
house
,
or
having
the
perfect
family
.
It
’
s
about
learning
to
hold
ourselves
with
love
and
respect
,
celebrating
our
strengths
,
and
honoring
our
weaknesses
.
Meditation
is
a
powerful
tool
which
helps
us
step
more
fully
into
our
authentic
selves
,
and
learn
to
appreciate
our
unique
gifts
and
qualities
.
Every
time
we
make
room
for
our
breath
,
just
as
it
is
,
we
are
developing
self-acceptance
.
And
when
we
turn
towards
our
experience
with
appreciation
and
kindness
,
we
are
building
our
capacity
to
honor
and
celebrate
ourselves
.
It
is
from
this
place
that
we
also
learn
to
appreciate
and
value
who
we
are
,
how
we
speak
and
act
,
and
how
we
move
through
our
days
.
As
Maya
Angelou
once
said
:
“
Success
is
liking
yourself
,
liking
what
you
do
,
and
liking
how
you
do
it.
”
Now
,
slowly
come
back
to
your
breath
and
send
a
wave
of
appreciation
into
your
whole
body
.
When
you
’
re
ready
,
wiggle
your
fingers
and
toes
.
And
let
your
eyes
softly
open
.
Enjoy
the
rest
of
your
day
,
and
we
’
ll
see
you
back
here
soon
.

English
(

welcome
to
a
guided
meditation
for
focus
for
studying
on
the
clutter
of
the
mind
let
's
start
the
practice
by
finding
a
comfortable
seat
you
can
practice
this
meditation
right
where
you
're
planning
to
study
so
it
can
be
on
a
computer
chair
or
seat
in
the
library
or
in
the
bedroom
or
in
the
office
and
just
ensure
you
're
sitting
with
your
back
upright
but
comfortable
and
resting
your
hands
in
your
lap
let
's
start
with
our
eyes
open
and
taking
in
a
few
big
deep
breaths
breathing
in
through
the
nose
and
out
through
the
mouth
and
now
if
you
're
doing
this
meditation
in
public
such
as
in
a
library
or
school
[
Music
]
you
can
keep
your
eyes
opened
for
the
practice
just
maintain
a
soft
gaze
looking
downwards
otherwise
you
can
close
your
eyes
here
and
allow
your
breath
to
return
to
a
comfortable
pace
and
let
's
start
by
reflecting
on
the
reality
of
our
distraction-filled
world
there
's
so
many
things
competing
for
our
attention
but
we
ultimately
have
in
us
the
ability
to
maintain
control
over
our
minds
and
our
attention
so
let
's
start
by
setting
an
intention
for
this
practice
in
your
mind
repeat
the
following
may
i
have
a
focused
and
energized
meditation
session
and
now
let
's
turn
our
attention
to
the
breath
most
of
us
do
n't
notice
that
we
are
breathing
all
day
long
we
simply
forget
that
we
are
breathing
we
're
so
caught
up
in
our
days
and
thoughts
it
just
sits
there
in
the
background
without
us
noticing
so
let
's
bring
our
attention
to
the
breath
and
notice
the
sensations
around
breathing
and
you
do
n't
need
to
change
the
breath
here
just
allow
the
body
to
breathe
on
its
own
and
notice
it
watch
the
rising
and
falling
sensations
around
the
body
with
each
inhale
and
exhale
and
when
you
inhale
naturally
picture
yourself
breathing
all
the
way
down
into
your
toes
feel
as
though
the
air
travels
all
the
way
into
each
one
of
your
toes
on
each
in-breath
and
notice
as
you
do
this
as
you
watch
the
breath
and
maintain
this
visual
thoughts
and
feelings
may
arise
and
attempt
to
pull
your
attention
away
from
the
breath
just
like
distractions
in
the
world
that
attempt
to
pull
your
attention
away
while
you
study
but
we
can
notice
distractions
just
like
we
notice
the
breath
and
when
a
distraction
arises
we
do
n't
need
to
engage
with
it
or
follow
it
with
more
thinking
simply
allow
the
distraction
to
come
and
go
through
the
mind
and
then
return
your
attention
back
to
the
breath
and
now
imagine
that
when
you
inhale
you
are
breathing
all
the
way
into
each
fingertip
imagine
the
feeling
in
your
hands
as
the
breath
extends
all
the
way
into
each
fingertip
and
again
if
you
find
that
the
mind
has
become
distracted
or
lost
in
thought
if
it
's
planning
or
thinking
about
what
you
'll
be
doing
after
the
practice
do
n't
become
frustrated
or
attach
more
thoughts
to
these
thoughts
simply
notice
it
as
a
distraction
allow
the
thought
to
dissipate
and
then
return
your
attention
to
the
breath
and
now
i
want
you
to
bring
your
attention
to
how
you
are
feeling
right
now
notice
how
focused
or
unfocused
you
are
in
this
moment
there
's
no
judgment
needed
just
be
with
whatever
you
notice
and
when
it
's
time
to
focus
and
study
all
we
need
to
do
is
calm
the
mind
and
ground
our
attention
our
goal
is
to
keep
our
mind
with
the
task
at
hand
and
let
it
enter
a
flow
state
on
its
own
we
just
need
to
create
the
internal
conditions
to
allow
that
to
happen
but
this
also
means
creating
the
right
conditions
in
our
external
world
so
this
practice
focused
on
our
internal
worlds
but
outside
we
need
to
mute
our
phones
close
out
all
other
tabs
use
tools
that
allow
us
to
block
social
media
and
news
sites
create
the
conditions
both
internally
and
externally
for
a
successful
study
session
and
now
let
's
close
out
the
practice
by
setting
an
intention
for
our
studying
session
and
for
the
rest
of
our
day
so
in
your
mind
repeat
may
i
have
a
focused
and
productive
study
session
may
i
be
undistracted
and
concentrated
may
i
be
committed
to
my
studies
may
i
focus
effortlessly
and
now
open
your
eyes
you
've
just
completed
the
practice
for
studying
thanks
for
sitting
and
may
you
have
a
focused
and

and
fills
up
your

flows
out

takes
with

any
physical

emotional
tension
as

that
tension
just
melts
away
from

to
be
gone
forever

you
may
still
have
thoughts
going
through
your

notice
them
from
afar

an
observer
then
allow
the
thoughts
to

to
the
sound
of
my

relaxation
and
discovery

your
breath
deepens

your
attention
on
the
stillness
between
the
breaths
take
another
deep
slow
breath
in

your
deepest
breath

fill
your
lungs
completely
and
then
release
the
breath
through
your
mouth
like
a
sigh
empty
your
lungs
completely
and
feel
all
the
tension
in
your
body
loosen
then
inviting
your
breath
to
return
to
a
natural
rhythm

to
deepen
your
level
of
relaxation

permission
to
be
fully
supported
by
the
surface

turn
off
all
distractions

of
letting
go
of
expectations
letting
go
of
comparisons
and
just
discover
what
comes
up
without
any
judgement
and
now
turn
your
attention
to
the
top
of
your
head
and
imagine
there
is
a
warm
light
surrounding
you
and
protecting
you
visualize
this
light
see
the
lights
color
see
the
glowing
nature
of
the
soft
warm
light
and
as
this
light
passes
over
your
body
it
progressively
relaxes
you
and
releases
each
muscle
small
and
large
from
your
head
all
the
way
down
to
your
toes
so
you
begin
to
feel
your
forehead
soften
and
smooth
your
eyebrows
and
eyes
melt
the
tiny
muscles
around
your
eyes
release
you
feel
your
eyelids
becoming
very
heavy
your
cheeks
lengthen
down
on
the
sides
of
your
face
you
part
your
teeth
unclench
your
jaw
and
relax
your
tongue
you
feel
your
throat
softening
and
as
the
muscles
around
your
eyes
let
go
and
the
jaw
releases
the
rest
of
the
body
knows
what
to
do
and
will
respond
by
letting
go
of
any
held
tension
as
well
you
see
and
feel
the
warm
glowing
light
moving
downwards
continuing
this
progressive
relaxation
like
a
wave
washing
over
you
feel
the
tension
melting
out
of
your
shoulders
moving
down
your
arms
so
that
the
tension
flows
out
of
your
body
through
your
fingertips
feel
how
each
part
of
your
body
becomes
heavy
and
connected
to
the
Earth
's
energy
as
you
allow
it
to
let
go
this
connection
of
energy
will
support
you
on
your
journey
of
self-discovery
today
with
each
breath
your
chest
and
abdomen
begin
to
feel
heavy
and
you
are
fully
supported
by
your
surroundings
and
protected
by
this
glowing
calming
light
as
it
continues
the
relaxation
process
and
notice
how
deep
and
calm
your
breath
has
become
as
you
continue
to
relax
deeper
and
deeper

light
continues
to
move
down
your
body
releasing
the
tension
from
your
lower
back
and
hips

thighs
and
pelvis
feel
very
heavy
and
sink
down
into
the
surface
below
you
your
knee
is
softened
and
your
calves
melt
as
your
body
continues
to
rest
heavy
your
ankles
and
feet
let
go
of
any
remaining
tension
that
your
body
may
still
feel
to
be
completely
relaxed
safe
and
supported
now
take
one
more
moment
to
scan
your
body
for
any
residual
tightness
pain
or
tension
and
then
breathe
into
that
area
so
that
you
can
completely
let
go
and
surrender
to
the
heaviness
of
gravity
and
now
your
whole
body
is
heavy
on
the
earth

for
you
to
give
more
value

doing
what
you
love
in
the
world
around
you
and
how
will
that
feel

feelings
up
to
the
surface
for

end

suddenly
see
before

stone
rock
wall
approach
the
wall
that
barricades
your
way
as
you
look
around
on
either
side
of
the
mall
you
see
that
there
's
no
way
around
this
wall
and
as
you
look
up
at
how
high
the
wall
is
you
realize
that
you
have
to
go
past
this
wall
the
progress
on
your
journey
remaining
on
the
side
of
the
wall
limits
your
personal
growth
perhaps
you
can
jump
over
this
wall
move
back
just
a
bit
and
run
a
few
steps
jumping
up
as
high
as
you
can
however
you
can
not
reach
the
top
you
slide
back
down
and
this
time
you
walk
back
even
further
and
you
run
harder
and
jump
towards
the
top
of
this
wall
but
you
still
can
not
reach
the
top
again
you
slide
back
down
the
wall
so
now
you
go
back
many
feet
and
with
a
running
start
you
run
as
hard
as
you
can
and
jump
as
high
as
you
can
and
clench
your
fingers
on
the
top
of
the
wall
soon
start
scratching
your
arms
hurting
your
elbows
as
you
fall
back
upon
the
ground
and
suddenly
you
realize
that
this
wall
it
's
a
part
of
yourself
that
you've
repressed
it
's
a
part
of
you
carefully
hidden
from
the
world
and
perhaps
even
yourself
this
wall
was
a
block
on
your
journey
through
life
it
's
a
part
of
yourself
and
needs
to
be
healed
but
you
must
move
beyond
this
wall
in
order
to
continue
to
grow
and
learn
about
yourself
so
one
more
time
we
try
to
go
over
this
wall
you
start
back
even
further
and
run
harder
you
jump
as
high
as
you
can
climbing
grasping
at
the
wall
but
you
slide
down
scratching
your
face
and
hands
hurt
your
knees
and
as
you
stand
up
and
look
at
yourself
you
realize
that
to
fight
this
wall
will
destroy
you
so
you
think
what
am
I
gon
na
do
how
am
I
gon
na
get
past
this
wall
this
part
of
myself
that
needs
to
be
healed
if
it
's
important
for
you
to
know
take
a
moment
now
to
understand
a
part
of
you
is
causing
this
block
what
is
the
emotion
or
event
that
has
kept
you
stuck
walk
up
now
and
place
your
hands
on
the
wall
you
can
smell
the
stones
and
feel
the
roughness
of
the
wall
you
realize
again
there
's
no
way
around
this
wall
and
no
way
to
go
over
or
under
this
wall
you
have
to
go
through
the
wall
ask
yourself
I
will
take
you
through
this
wall
all
your
beliefs
will
help
you
now
a
belief
in
yourself
that
you
can
do
anything
and
you
can
do
it
begin
the
pro
one
foot
into
the
wall
and
feel
your
foot
go
into
the
wall
put
one
hand
into
the
wall

your
other
foot
into
the
wall
and
your
other
hand
into
the
wall
you
're
now
a
few
inches
unto
the
wall
it
's
becoming
very
clear
now
you
have
to
get
through
this
block
in
order
to
heal
there
's
no
way
around
it
no
way
over
it
in
no
way
to
go
under
it
take
one
more
step
and
another
step
and
soon
you
realize
that
the
wall
is
very
thick
but
you
're
standing
in
it
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
this
wall
breathing
easily
and
effortlessly
standing
in
the
middle
of
your
block
you
may
be
wondering
how
can
I
do
this
how
can
I
move
myself
through
a
wall
did
you
have
a
choice
you
may
go
back
to
the
other
side
of
the
wall
or
you
can
continue
toward
greater
freedom
and
personal
growth
and
if
you
decide
to
continue
through
this
wall
take
another
step
and
another
step
and
as
you
can
get
almost
to
the
edge
of
the
wall
you
have
to
decide
can
I
continue
can
I
break
through
this
wall

can
do
it

more

be
a
mantra

guided
meditation
that
you
can
come
back
to

's
response
for
plants
that
needed
to
attract
pollinators
leaves
were
nature
's
response
for
plants
that
needed
more
energy
the
challenges
that
I
face
are
a
natural
part
of
life
and
like
a
beautiful
garden
my
mind
will
grow
from
facing
the
challenges
before
me
when
I
'm
stretching
my
abilities
I
expect
to
make
some
mistakes
so
when
these
mistakes
come
I
'm
going
to
react
by
taking
a
new
approach
by
taking
a
smaller
step
towards
solving
the
problem
or
when
the
stakes
are
especially
high
I
'm
going
to
use
small
experiments
to
test
my
ideas
before
I
put
them
into
broader
action
each
time
that
I
try
something
new
I
'm
planting
a
seed

grows
from

challenge
that
I
face

my
challenges

the
fertilizer
for
the
garden
of
my
mind
the
belief
that
I
will
never
be
able
to
do
something
is
the
ugly
weed
in
the
garden
of
my
mind
and
I
'm
removing
these
weeds
by
smiling
in
the
face
of
new
challenges
the
garden

this
small
change
that
they
made

does
this
change
affect
their

welcome
to
dark
seas
manifest
series
in
this
meditation
you
will
be
guided
into
a
state
where
you
will
be
setting
your
intentions
visualizing
and
manifesting
your
dream
job
all
while
you
go
to
sleep
the
five
minutes
right
before
falling
asleep
is
called
the
twilight
stage
in
this
stage
you
are
in
the
area
between
your
conscious
and
unconscious
mind
and
this
is
the
most
powerful
time
to
set
your
intentions
on
what
you
want
to
manifest
you
have
the
ability
to
consciously
speak
with
the
subconscious
mind
and
give
it
specific
directions
on
what
you
want
and
your
subconscious
can
do
nothing
other
than
follow
these
directions
and
find
the
perfect
solution
all
while
you
are
asleep
it
is
completely
effortless
now
whether
you
are
looking
for
the
perfect
job
right
now
or
just
figuring
out
what
you
want
to
do
understand
that
you
are
limitless
in
this
area
wherever
your
heart
takes
you
trust
it
it
can
be
easy
to
allow
fear
to
make
decisions
like
this
in
your
life
the
fear
of
having
enough
money
enough
time
enough
intelligence
enough
energy
a
job
can
take
up
much
of
a
person
's
life
so
it
is
worth
the
extra
time
to
really
think
about
what
you
want
to
do
without
having
these
fears
hold
you
back
you
could
wake
up
every
morning
dreading
to
go
to
work
wasting
your
life
or
you
can
wake
up
with
joy
and
excitement
tap
dancing
to
work
because
it
's
not
just
a
job
it
's
a
passion
you
can
have
this
and
you
will
have
this
when
you
see
it
in
your
mind
and
you
believe
it
now
make
sure
you
are
comfortable
and
ready
for
sleep
you
will
be
guided
down
through
this
meditation
into
a
relaxed
state
until
you
are
fully
asleep
follow
along
with
the
meditation
as
long
as
you
want
if
you
feel
tired
just
let
go
and
feel
free
to
fall
asleep
your
subconscious
will
take
over
from
there
so
let
's
start
off
by
taking
a
deep
breath
in
and
release
letting
out
all
the
stress
from
the
day
just
letting
go
completely
take
another
deep
breath
in
and
release
as
you
notice
the
outside
thoughts
arise
in
your
mind
you
can
acknowledge
them
and
just
let
them
go
your
body
is
becoming
more
and
more
relaxed
as
you
sink
down
into
the
ground
beneath
you
you
let
all
the
worry
and
stress
just
melt
away
as
you
continue
to
feel
more
comfortable
completely
relaxed
now
going
down
deeper
into
relaxation
getting
to
that
twilight
stage
in
between
consciousness
and
sleep
it
is
time
now
to
set
your
intentions
on
your
dream
job
I
want
you
to
set
the
intention
right
now
that
you
have
already
attracted
your
dream
job
whether
you
know
what
that
job
is
or
you
are
still
figuring
this
out

is

get
to
go
to
work
and
to
you
it

like

it

much
that
you
would
even
do
it
for
free

getting
into

whatever
that
looks

for
you
whenever
you
're
ready
lovingly
close
your
beautiful
eyes
and
begin
to
allow
your
awareness
to
drift
inwards
tuning
into
breath
and
body
identifying
a
sense
of
flow
in
your
breath
and
a
sense
of
stillness
in
your
body
feeling
that
both
are
possible
in
this
moment
in
each
moment
in
all
moments
feeling
that
neither
one
is
good
or
bad
better

or
less
than
feeling
how
flow
and

go
hand
in
hand
even
if
only
for
this
moment
finding
and
identifying
the
stillness
in
your
body
and
the
flow
in
your
breath
perhaps
feeling
how
they
work
together
the
flow
of
the
breath
makes
the
stillness
possible
or
rather
it
makes
the
awareness
of
the
stillness
possible
for
without
the
breath
there
goes
the
awareness
feel
within
you
a
marriage
of
stillness
and
flow
a
sense
of
understanding
a
marriage
between
both
being
and
becoming
for
what
you
already
are
is
simultaneously
becoming
we
will
be
there
is
both
a
stillness
and
a
flow
let
your
awareness
now
drop
down
into
your
heart
's
energy
center
in
the
middle
of
your
chest
and
a
couple
of
inches
inwards
finding
the
space
resting
in
a
sense
of
solace
within
this
space
a
sense
of
peace
and
stillness
a
sense
of
hope

openness

you
feel
a
curiosity
a
pulling
a

the

to
be
wide

may

your

it
as
something
from
the

a

gear
this
high

vehicle
trust
your
imagination
and
find
before
you
now
a
lever
and
as
you
push
it
forward
feel
this
ship
this
vehicle
you
've
built
rising
moving
forward
and
up
trust
your
path

yourself
lifting
above
the
tree

seeing
now
your
entire

seeing
now
your

exiting
the

now
seeing
the

earth
let
yourself
zoom
to
a
spot
in
the
universe
that
feels
just
right
for
you
trusting
your
imagination
and
where
it
brings
you
now
what
is
your
view
what
do
you
see
and
perhaps
more
importantly
what
do
you
feel
out
here
in
this
vastness
of
space
let
your
imagination
sense
that
there
is
love
it
's
not
empty

it
is
love
you
may
imagine
what
appears
to
be
space
is
actually
full
of
and
teeming
with
life
in
a
non-physical
non-visible
way
this
is
more
a
job
for
the
imagination
and
the
heart
than
it
is
for
logic
you
may
sense
perhaps
a
glittering
in
the
air
a
light
emanating
or
maybe
nothing
at
all
but
just
a
feeling
of
love
a
feeling
of
life
force
energy
and
you
feel
a
pull
within
your
heart
to
receive
this
love
to
support
you
in
both
your
stillness

your
flow
in
both
your
being

your
becoming
tune
in
to
how
you
feel
you
know
within
you
that
this
loving
energy
this
life
force
will
assist
you
in
both
aspects
of
being
and
becoming
stillness
and
flow
and
when
you
're
ready
you
find
a
big
bold
button
inside
of
your
machine
and
you
have
an
intuitive
knowing
that
when
you
press
it
doors
will
open
and
love
will
come
flooding
in
when
you
feel
ready
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
on
your
exhale
press
the
button
feel
the
doors
of
this
spherical
vehicle
opening
wide
and
on
your
next
inhale
feel
yourself
receiving
the
love
from
the
universe
the
love
that
's
all
around
you
feel
it
flowing
into
your
heart
into
every
cell
of
your
being
and
as
you
exhale
feel
it
flowing
throughout
you
settling
in
imagining
that
the
breathing
in
is
the
flow
is
the
becoming
and
the
breathing
out
is
the
stillness
the

sensing
love

into
both
of
these
aspects

your

as
you
tune
into

energy

you
discover

gently
open
your

back

around
you
wonderful
job
today
we
so
appreciate
you
being
here
youbegin
this
practice
by
letting
your
body
get
nice
and
cozy
whatever
that
looks
like
for
you
lovingly
close
your
eyes
untune
your
awareness
in
words
noticing
your
breath
your
body
any
Sensations
occurring
within
you
and
letting
the
weight
of
gravity
take
over
as
you
relax
into
your
body
taking
a
moment
to
adjust
your
muscles
as
needed
to
let
them
all
become
soft
and
loose
there
is
nothing
to
hold
on
to
here
safe
to
let
go
to
let
the
muscles
in
your
face
become
Slack
to
let
your
shoulders
drop
down
to
let
any
other
muscles
that
you
do
not
need
right
now
become
still
relaxed
and
at
peace
and
as
you
feel
yourself
sinking
down
more
deeply
with
the
weight
of
gravity
you
become
aware
of
a
red
rose
in
the
middle
of
your
chest
inside
your
heart
he
even
feel
as
though
you
smell
a
beautiful
fragrant
red
rose
now
notice
how
each
petal
in
your
heart
is
perfect
healthy
whole
even
glimmering
slightly
this
radiant
red
rose
is
fresh
blooming
fully
in
its
peak
in
its
prime
notice
how
that
energy
feels
radiantly
glowing
in
your
heart
you
may
notice
it
feels
fresh
and
free
full
of
love
possibility
blooming
with
a
sense
of
boldness
a
fervent
trust
in
life
and
as
you
tune
into
its
energy
you
ask
yourself
does
the
Rose
resist
its
bloom
you
feel
an
immediate
no
answer
within
you
a
rose
can
not
resist
its
Bloom
for
it
is
natural
it
's
a
natural
unfolding
process
so
too
is
the
nature
of
your
life
at
Birth
like
a
flower
you
are
but
a
seed
and
within
the
seed
contained
the
blueprint
of
the
whole
the
growing
stems
and
leaves
tiny
bud
the
blooming
and
blossoming
flower
and
eventually
the
returning
into
the
Earth
the
seed
of
the
flower
does
not
fear
the
cycle
and
therefore
it
just
happens
naturally
and
you
watch
the
beautiful
Blooms
of
flowers
take
place
in
the
summer
new
experience
many
cycles
of
Summer
cycles
of
spring
fall
and
winter
there
are
natural
cycles
in
your
life
just
like
in
all
plants
and
animals
on
the
planet
you
are
not
separate
from
that
[
Music

when
you
relax
and
Trust
in
the
flow
when
you
are
non-resistant
towards
your
life
everything
unfolds
naturally
perfectly
and
with
ease
you
can
trust
that
each
step
each
passing
moment
each
smile
each
each
grimace
every
experience
is
a
beautiful

you
are
the
beautiful
simultaneous
Observer

in
The
Game
of
Life
balancing
the
mix
of
the
two
perfectly
through
non-resist
you
imagine
yourself
standing
before
a
cliff
with
your
arms
outstretched
wide
you
may
even
feel
called
to
let
your
arms
stretch
out
wide
breathe
into
this
feeling
of
being
open
imagining
a
cool
breeze
brushing
against

feeling
this

in

there
is
always
another
inhale
behind
every

Welcome
to
SoothingPod
’
s
meditation
.
In
this
meditation
,
we
will
be
exploring
defensiveness
as
it
presents
itself
in
our
own
being
.
This
is
not
defensiveness
that
arises
when
we
need
to
physically
protect
ourselves
;
rather
,
it
is
in
relation
to
the
defensiveness
that
comes
up
when
we
feel
misunderstood
or
criticized
.
Note
that
this
meditation
will
include
a
visualization
of
past
defensiveness
,
so
if
there
is
past
trauma
in
relation
to
this
theme
,
another
meditation
may
be
better
suited
.
To
begin
this
practice
,
take
a
moment
to
find
a
comfortable
seated
position
.
Relax
your
shoulders
and
straighten
your
spine
as
you
close
your
eyes
to
settle
in
.
Draw
your
attention
to
the
breath
as
you
take
a
few
silent
moments
to
arrive
in
this
practice
.
Let
the
mind
come
to
meet
you
where
you
are
by
noticing
the
earth
beneath
you…
…
the
air
around
you…
…
and
any
feelings
or
sensations
that
are
moving
through
you
.
Simply
note
what
is
here
and
then
come
back
to
the
breath
to
anchor
yourself
.
Each
breath
brings
us
back
into
the
present
moment
,
as
long
as
we
are
fully
attentive
to
its
flow
.
If
there
are
any
thoughts
or
stories
continuing
to
loop
through
the
mind
,
take
a
moment
now
to
soften
the
forehead
and
your
eyebrows
,
easing
this
area
of
your
being
.
It
’
s
also
helpful
to
remember
,
as
we
move
through
this
practice
,
that
it
is
natural
for
the
mind
to
wander
.
Anytime
you
notice
your
attention
has
drifted
,
just
gently
bring
it
back
to
your
breath
,
to
your
body
,
or
to
the
words
spoken
here
.
And
now
take
just
a
few
more
moments
to
mindfully
anchor
yourself
through
the
breath
before
we
begin
our
exploration
of
defensiveness
.
Liken
the
breath
to
steady
waves
coming
into
and
out
of
the
shore
of
your
body
.
Let
’
s
now
consider
the
words
of
Gary
Chapman
.
In
his
words
,
“
Defensive
behavior
is
a
barrier
to
communication.
”
And
it
is
true
:
When
we
go
into
defensive
mode
,
we
contract
,
which
stifles
the
possibility
for
meaningful
connection
.
But
what
is
defensiveness
really
,
and
why
does
it
arise
?
To
better
understand
this
tendency
,
we
can
consider
defensiveness
as
part
of
the
body
’
s
fight
,
flight
,
or
freeze
response
.
When
we
perceive
we
are
being
threatened
in
some
way
,
it
is
only
natural
that
we
try
to
defend
ourselves
.
When
we
are
faced
with
imminent
danger
,
this
response
is
helpful
and
even
necessary
.
However
,
when
we
defend
ourselves
habitually
against
other
people
’
s
views
,
needs
,
and
expressions
,
we
fuel
the
divide
between
us
.
We
might
consider
that
our
defenses
arise
largely
due
to
our
past
conditioning
,
which
explains
why
I
might
feel
defensive
about
something
entirely
different
to
what
would
cause
the
same
reaction
in
you
.
The
more
aware
we
are
of
our
own
defensive
tendencies
,
the
easier
it
becomes
to
soften
this
response
where
it
is
safe
for
us
to
do
so
.
And
instead
of
this
inner
defense
,
we
might
cultivate
greater
compassion
,
curiosity
,
and
openness
to
the
words
and
feelings
of
others
.
As
we
ease
any
tendency
we
have
to
be
defensive
,
our
communication
with
others
improves
,
our
relationships
get
stronger
,
and
our
capacity
for
growth
flourishes
.
To
practice
this
,
take
a
moment
to
come
back
into
the
body
.
Notice
whatever
is
physically
present
for
you
now
,
and
where
possible
,
see
if
you
might
soften
any
tightness
or
contraction
you
may
be
experiencing
.
Observe
the
breath
that
flows
through
you
.
Let
each
inhalation
create
more
space
for
compassionate
exploration
.
Now
,
compassionately
–
and
with
curiosity
–
consider
a
time
when
you
reacted
defensively
to
something
that
someone
said
.
Without
judging
or
defending
yourself
in
your
mind
,
simply
note
what
it
felt
like
in
the
body
to
go
into
a
defensive
mode
.
And
as
you
hold
this
scenario
in
your
mind
without
judgment
,
see
if
you
might
let
the
breath
flow
a
little
bit
deeper
.
Soften
your
jaw…
your
shoulders…
or
any
other
area
where
tension
may
be
present
.
Draw
your
attention
to
the
heart
space
now
,
and
take
a
moment
to
cultivate
a
sense
of
self-love
in
the
face
of
whatever
led
to
you
to
contract
and
defend
.
When
we
hold
ourselves
in
unconditional
self-love
,
we
are
less
likely
to
react
strongly
in
the
face
of
criticism
or
differences
of
opinion
.
Now
,
consider
if
,
in
the
face
of
something
that
makes
you
want
to
defend
your
inner
world
,
it
is
possible
to
become
a
bit
more
curious
–
about
both
your
own
reaction
and
the
words
of
others
.
Consider
if
it
might
be
possible
to
hold
differing
views
at
the
same
time
without
resentment
or
judgment
.
Consider
how
harnessing
compassion
–
for
both
oneself
and
others
–
might
ease
the
defensiveness
that
arises
within
.
And
now
,
continuing
to
hold
your
attention
on
the
heart
space
,
take
a
few
moments
to
repeat
the
following
words
in
silence
:
I
love
myself
unconditionally
.
I
am
open
to
new
perspectives
.
I
am
willing
to
learn
and
to
grow
.
I
am
calm
in
the
face
of
criticism
.
I
communicate
with
curiosity
and
compassion
.
I
love
myself…
unconditionally
.
Take
a
few
final
moments
now
to
let
all
words
dissolve
as
you
hold
onto
this
sense
of
self-love
and
compassion
for
others
.
Come
back
to
your
breath
,
minding
the
ebb
and
flow
into
and
out
of
the
body
.
Ground
yourself
back
into
the
seat
or
floor
beneath
you…
…
and
when
you
are
ready
,
you
may
slowly
let
your
eyes
flutter
open
.
I
hope
you
enjoyed
today

s
session

whatever

before
returning
to
your
day
thank
you
so
much
for
being
here
take
careSo
,
welcome
,
everyone
to
our
Saybrook
University
and
Mindfulness
Moment
!
I
'm
so
glad
to
be
here
with
you
all
.
So
,
for
this
time
that
we
're
together
,
I
invite
you
to
get
cozy
,
and
we
'll
be
spending
this
time
in
inquiry
.
So
,
maybe
you
would
like
to
grab
a
journal
or
a
notebook
if
that
feels
right
to
you
.
If
not
,
that
's
okay
too
.
Just
simply
arriving
as
you
are
and
engaging
in
this
experience
.
Just
holding
this
meditation
in
your
mind
's
eye
and
just
bathing
in
response
.
So
,
as
you
settle
in
and
maybe
you
are
grabbing
for
a
journal
.
Maybe
a
pen
or
pencil
.
We
'll
just
preface
this
experience
.
So
,
tomorrow
,
we
're
experiencing
a
full
moon
and
I
often
like
to
reflect
.
Spend
some
time
reflecting
around
what
that
means
for
myself
and
also
for
us
as
a
collective
.
So
,
there
's
a
certain
energy
that
comes
with
this
full
moon
and
with
every
full
moon
as
we
're
shifting
from
one
moon
cycle
to
the
next
.
Here
we
are
,
moving
through
Spring
.
We
're
really
shedding
those
days
of
Winter
,
and
we
're
growing
through
Spring
.
We
see
growth
happening
around
us
,
and
there
's
a
real
core
energy
that
comes
with
this
time
of
year
I
think
.
So
,
one
that
calls
us
to
find
balance
to
create
harmony
and
to
attend
to
relationships
.
So
,
for
me
,
that
also
means
attending
and
acknowledging
to
relationship
with
disharmony
.
So
,
noticing
how
you
relate
to
other
people
.
How
you
relate
to
your
community
and
recognizing
differences
between
defensiveness
versus
receptivity
.
How
are
you
moving
through
your
life
?
How
are
you
moving
through
change
in
your
life
?
Is
there
pushing
or
fighting
or
burning
of
self
maybe
?
I
'd
like
to
think
of
these
periods
that
we
go
through
as
shedding
of
ourselves
.
We
shed
,
kind
of
releasing
old
patterns
of
thinking
or
behaviors
that
no
longer
serve
us
.
Kind
of
move
into
a
growth
edge
.
So
,
what
I
'd
like
you
to
continue
or
to
begin
or
really
consider
here
is
how
are
you
shedding
what
no
longer
serves
you
.
How
can
you
do
this
in
a
way
that
holds
yourself
more
deeply
?
Kind
of
allows
you
to
move
through
change
and
discomfort
with
dignity
and
self-respect
and
to
more
clearly
see
the
opportunities
for
growth
.
Profound
growth
.
So
,
again
,
just
however
you
would
like
to
be
right
now
.
I
'll
drop
in
a
few
questions
into
your
awareness
and
then
hold
some
silent
space
for
you
to
explore
in
your
journal
or
through
writing
or
if
you
feel
like
you
just
want
to
sit
in
still
awareness
.
So
,
however
you
would
like
to
be
right
now
is
perfectly
fine
.
Again
,
just
calling
yourself
back
into
just
thinking
about
what
are
you
shedding
?
What
are
you
letting
go
of
right
now
and
how
are
you
moving
towards
your
growth
edge
?
So
,
as
we
let
go
of
parts
of
ourselves
,
there
are
some
things
that
we
want
to
hold
on
to
.
So
,
here
this
question
really
being
that
I
want
you
to
sit
with
:
what
are
some
characteristics
you
love
about
yourself
and
want
in
every
version
of
you
?
So
,
I
'll
just
say
that
again
.
What
are
some
characteristics
you
love
about
yourself
and
want
in
every
version
of
you
?
I
'll
just
hold
some
space
now
for
you
to
move
through
dialoguing
about
this
or
just
sitting
with
that
in
your
own
body
and
mind
.
So
,
maybe
jotting
down
or
even
considering
a
few
more
aspects
or
qualities
or
characteristics
that
really
make
you
YOU
.
Shifting
now
.
I
'll
drop
in
another
question
for
you
to
silently
consider
or
to
express
onto
the
page
,
which
is
:
what
skins
am
I
shedding
?
We
're
talking
about
this
letting
go
and
moving
into
new
growth
.
So
,
what
skins
are
you
shedding
?
For
example
,
something
that
comes
to
mind
for
me
and
where
I
'm
at
is
a
shedding
of
the
hustle
mentality
.
This
go-go-go
Westernized
mentality
.
So
,
again
,
what
skins
are
you
shedding
?
Just
allowing
yourself
to
bring
awareness
to
this
in
your
mind
's
eye
.
Maybe
allowing
those
words
to
format
onto
the
page
.
Holding
all
of
this
with
kind
awareness
.
Acknowledging
that
shedding
of
old
skins
,
and
it
's
not
easy
.
It
's
not
easy
and
there
can
be
some
resistance
that
comes
up
with
this
as
we
're
metamorphisizing
.
So
,
now
shifting
again
.
Shifting
your
awareness
to
now
considering
how
you
can
support
yourself
through
this
change
and
how
you
can
support
yourself
through
your
difficult
times
.
So
,
are
final
question
to
consider
that
I
'd
like
to
drop
in
here
is
to
ask
yourself
how
do
I
desire
to
be
loved
?
This
is
a
two
part
question
.
How
do
I
desire
to
be
loved
and
how
can
I
love
myself
the
way
I
desire
?
I
'll
say
that
again
.
How
do
I
desire
to
be
loved
?
First
thinking
about
that
.
How
can
I
love
myself
the
way
I
desire
?
So
,
allowing
yourself
to
consider
what
you
write
down
anything
else
that
feels
meaningful
for
you
here
.
So
,
now
as
we
begin
to
bring
this
inquiry
practice
to
a
gentle
close
.
Just
allowing
yourself
to
really
sit
with
whatever
meaning
or
insight
that
might
have
come
forth
from
this
experience
.
Taking
with
you
what
feels
important
and
maybe
you
had
been
closing
your
eyes
if
you
were
just
bathing
in
that
still
awareness
.
If
so
,
just
allowing
yourself
to
come
back
into
this
space
that
you
were
in
.
Refocusing
on
what
's
around
you
.
Just
acknowledging
that
there
are
others
who
are
gathered
here
in
this
experience
with
you
.
Sharing
this
meditative
space
.
So
,
maybe
something
came
up
for
you
that
feels
important
.
So
,
you
might
choose
to
speak
from
a
place
of
experience
or
perhaps
you
would
like
to
not
say
anything
at
all
.
Just
be
with
that
experience
.
So
,
you
might
choose
to
remain
here
as
long
as
you
'd
like
with
a
sense
of
presence
.
Allowing
yourself
to
come
back
and
together
we
will
share
in
the
fruit
of
practice
.
Thank
you
so
much
everyone
for
being
here
today
.
May
you
all
be
well.welcome
to
doxy
meditations
I
want
to
share
with
you
the
true
and
incredible
power
we
all
have
inside
us
the
power
to
manifest
anything
we
want
human
progress
throughout
history
resembles
something
similar
to
a
staircase
there
is
a
long
period
of
time
with
no
significant
progress
just
straight
steady
and
stagnant
with
very
little
change
to
human
life
then
all
of
a
sudden
something
astounding
happens
a
near
vertical
jump
in
the
advancement
of
humankind
occurs
a
Leap
Forward
Leap
Forward
that
instantly
improves
the
lives
of
every
single
person
on
this
Earth
changing
the
trajectory
of
the
world
forever
path
of
stagnation
followed
by
instant
and
massive
growth
has
repeated
itself
all
throughout
history
but
why
does
this
happen
it
's
actually
very
simple
when
you
think
about
it
all
these
dramatic
advancements
to
human
life
occur
when
there
is
a
breakthrough
Discovery
or
invention
that
changes
the
world
these
are
simple
things
that
we
probably
use
every
day
or
even
take
for
granted
the
invention
of
the
wheel
allowed
for
much
faster
transportation
and
trade
the
printing
press
allowed
literacy
to
expand
rapidly
throughout
the
world
the
discovery
of
electricity
and
light
bulb
is
something
we
use
in
nearly
every
aspect
of
our
daily
lives
the
discovery
of
penicillin
has
saved
countless
lives
and
has
changed
the
field
of
medicine
forever
the
internet
has
changed
how
we
live
our
very
lives
revolutionizing
communication
and
allowing
everyone
access
to
virtually
all
the
information
in
the
world
instantly
giving
each
and
every
individual
more
power
than
any
king
or
queen
in
history
ever
had
before
its
existence
I
believe
this
stair-step
pattern
of
progress
is
a
universal
part
of
life
not
just
on
a
scale
of
the
entire
human
population
but
also
for
each
individual
all
of
us
go
through
stages
of
stagnation
where
it
seems
that
no
matter
what
we
do
we
can
never
make
progress
no
matter
how
hard
we
try
we
are
just
Out
Of
Reach
to
that
next
level
we
are
desperately
grasping
for
whether
we
are
grasping
for
more
wealth
Better
Health
a
loving
relationship
a
great
career
we
find
ourselves
stuck
in
the
mud
motionless
until
something
magical
happens
something
that
occurs
in
our
lives
that
changes
everything
something
that
catapults
us
to
another
level
it
's
easy
to
believe
that
this
is
mere
random
coincidence
but
I
assure
you
it
is
n't
it
is
something
that
can
be
controlled
and
used
in
your
favor
allowing
you
to
make
Leaps
and
Bounds
of
progress
in
your
life
rather
than
staying
in
that
stagnant
State
sitting
back
waiting
for
something
good
to
miraculously
happen
in
your
life
as
I
look
back
at
my
life
there
have
been
several
of
these
magical
moments
these
moments
of
absolute
transformation
and
growth
I
realized
that
all
these
occurrences
have
come
when
I
have
used
the
law
of
attraction
I
can
honestly
say
that
every
dramatic
Leap
Forward
in
my
life
has
been
because
of
the
law
of
attraction
from
first
finding
my
passions
in
life
to
eventually
Landing
my
dream
job
going
from
the
daily
worry
of
a
nightmare
of
huge
debt
to
an
abundance
and
continuous
source
of
wealth
finding
the
home
of
my
dreams
finding
the
woman
of
my
dreams
every
major
Leap
Forward
in
my
life
occurrences
that
have
changed
my
life
forever
have
all
been
because
of
this
incredible
power
I
want
to
share
with
you
the
techniques
I
use
to
manifest
these
incredible
leaps
of
progress
in
my
life
so
that
you
can
experience
this
as
well
so
that
you
can
dramatically
change
your
life
for
the
better
so
that
you
can
finally
create
a
life
that
you
thought
was
only
possible
in
your
dreams
you
will
do
this
all
as
you
are
falling
asleep
it
's
that
simple
sleep
meditation
will
open
your
powerful
subconscious
mind
to
suggestion
where
you
will
inject
your
intentions
and
visualizations
of
what
you
want
to
manifest
from
there
your
subconscious
mind
will
take
over
and
attract
to
you
exactly
what
you
want
and
it
will
all
seem
effortless
it
will
seem
like
magic
like
you
are
truly
in
a
dream
as
everything
you
ask
for
so
naturally
falls
into
place
and
comes
into
your
life
I
challenge
you
to
listen
to
this
sleep
meditation
every
night
for
30
nights
and
see
the
Miracles
that
begin
to
appear
in
your
life
so
when
you
are
ready
close
your
eyes
relax
and
let
's
begin
as
we
begin
this
meditation
take
a
nice
relaxing
deep
breath
in
and
relax
preparing
the
body
and
mind
for
rest
and
relaxation
but
before
we
go
any
further
I
want
you
to
set
the
intention
for
this
meditation
what
are
you
going
to
manifest
into
your
life
for
it
right
now
and
be
specific
now
I
want
you
to
just
let
that
go
as
you
take
another
relaxing
deep
breath
in
breathing
in
as
long
as
you
can
then
hold
it
for
a
moment
now
let
it
all
out
slowly
foreign
s
completely
pushing
out
all
that
air
squeezing
all
the
air
from
the
body
now
releasing
everything
right
now
now
you
can
just
relax
and
let
go
as
your
breath
gently
and
naturally
Moves
In
and
Out
of
the
body
feel
how
the
entire
body
has
become
instantly
and
deeply
relaxed
as
all
the
muscles
release
going
completely
limp
notice
how
a
relaxed
body
allows
the
mind
to
relax
as
well
letting
go
of
any
and
all
fears
or
worries
or
doubts
letting
go
of
all
thoughts
completely
as
you
take
another
deep
breath
in
hand
out
feeling
as
your
body
and
mind
begin
to
transition
into
the
realm
of
your
subconscious
mind
so
deeply
relaxed
now
you
can
feel
as
your
mind
's
eye
opens
looking
around
with
your
mind
's
eye
you
can
see
the
dust
all
around
you
from
the
barren
landscape
swirling
and
blowing
around
what
you
see
in
every
direction
is
a
vision
of
scarcity
though
just
a
little
ways
ahead
you
can
see
the
face
of
a
giant
sheer
cliff
needing
to
tilt
your
head
back
as
the
cliff
appears
to
be
a
mile
high
soaring
into
the
beautiful
Starry
Night
as
if
the
mountain
itself
or
reaching
for
the
Stars
so
relaxed
now
so
comfortable
a
wonderful
feeling
begins
to
grow
inside
you
like
a
voice
calling
to
you
pulling
you
to
what
is
on
the
top
of
that
mountain
you
can
not
yet
see
what
is
at
the
top
but
that
feeling
inside
you
is
telling
you
exactly
what
is
up
there
you
know
it
you
have
been
guided
to
this
spot
for
a
reason
exactly
what
you
want
exactly
what
you
asked
for
is
up
on
that
mountain
you
have
already
manifested
it
and
it
is
so
close
it
is
right
there
in
front
of
you
all
you
must
do
is
reach
it
as
you
look
up
at
the
treacherous
face
of
the
cliff
most
would
believe
it
to
be
impossible
to
reach
the
Pinnacle
of
this
mountain
but
a
feeling
of
belief
of
faith
deep
inside
you
begins
to
guide
you
closer
and
closer
you
come
to
the
face
of
this
mountain
you
reach
out
your
hand
and
begin
gliding
your
fingertips
across
the
sharp
rocks
suddenly
you
are
sent
a
vision
a
vision
of
what
is
on
top
of
this
mountain
you
can
already
see
yourself
at
the
Pinnacle
of
this
mountain
all
the
way
at
the
top
feeling
as
if
you
are
in
the
present
moment
you
have
manifested
exactly
what
you
asked
for
you
feel
amazing
knowing
that
you
manifested
it
into
your
life
and
then
a
flash
of
a
hidden
stairway
pierces
your
mind
you
now
know
how
to
reach
the
top
of
this
mountain
a
way
has
been
shown
to
you
continuing
to
Glide
across
the
mountain
with
the
palm
of
your
hand
you
can
feel
as
part
of
the
wall
gives
way
and
crumbles
around
your
outstretched
hand
the
small
Gap
around
your
hand
slowly
expands
until
a
large
opening
is
revealed
to
you
and
what
you
see
in
front
of
you
is
a
stairway
that
leads
up
all
the
way
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
your
faith
your
belief
has
been
rewarded
there
is
a
way
there
is
a
way
to
the
top
you
know
that
there
is
always
a
way
and
as
long
as
you
believe
that
way
will
be
shown
to
you
patiently
yet
deeply
excited
to
reach
your
desires
you
climb
up
the
stone
stairway
the
higher
you
climb
the
more
relaxed
your
body
becomes
the
higher

climb

more
excited
you
become
to
reach
your
destination

begin
to
see
the
Lush
trees
Peak
above
the
horizon
you
can
hear
the
crystal
clear
water
of
a
stream
gently
flowing
above
you
your
Paradise
awaits
you
it
is
so
close
that
you
again
begin
to
visualize
yourself
reaching
your
destination
where
everything
you
asked
for
has
manifested
into
your
life
these
Visions
seem
so
real
creating
an
even
deeper
sense
of
Desire
inside
you
your
feet
begin
to
move
so
swiftly
below
you
climbing
higher
and
higher
until
you
finally
reach
the
peak

is
so
beautiful

energy
free
and
even
to
set
the
net
free
casting
it
out
letting

free

down

wonderful
job
todayhello
and
welcome
to
inspired
meditations
this
guided
meditation
is
called
embrace
a
growth
and
success
mindset
95
%
of
our
thoughts
are
repetitive
if
that
's
any
indication
of
how
we
live
our
lives
we
repeat
a
lot
day
in
and
day
out
the
problem
with
this
is
we
begin
to
settle
into
a
groove
without
growth
and
to
be
successful
to
achieve
your
goals
you
need
to
do
something
you
have
n't
done
before
and
think
in
a
way
you
have
n't
thought
before
most
people
remain
stuck
in
the
same
old
patterns
and
limited
beliefs
and
thoughts
rendering
them
the
same
old
results
and
lack
of
growth
their
goals
have
changed
but
their
mindset
has
not
and
they
repeat
the
same
day
even
a
tree
planted
firmly
in
the
ground
finds
a
way
to
grow
it
grows
up
and
toward
the
sky
your
thoughts
and
beliefs
impact
your
reality
if
you
're
currently
operating
on
a
fixed
mindset
old
thoughts
or
you've
hit
too
many
dead
ends
you
may
think
is
is
it
or
be
convinced
this
is
it
please
give
this
guy
to
meditation
to
listen
do
n't
settle
for
what
you
already
have
and
nothing
more
when
you
are
desiring
so
much
more
are
n't
you
the
least
bit
curious
about
what
you
are
capable
of
new
growth
and
successful
thought
patterns
are
something
you
can
achieve
with
this
guided
meditation
if
you
are
ready
and
I
believe
you
are
let
's
begin
settle
yourself
into
your
seat
like
you
've
never
settled
before
go
ahead
let
loose
what
have
you
got
to
lose
give
yourself
permission
to
relax
you
can
say
to
yourself
permission
to
relax
permission
granted
permission
to
slump
over
restfully
like
a
sleeping
dog
or
napping
cat
you
will
be
relaxing
and
learning
here
and
relaxing
while
you
learn
learning
things
for
your
benefit
your
growth
your
personal
success
just
get
really
nice
and
comfortable
committed
to
this
process
you
are
preparing
to
alter
or
enhance
your
current
mindset
in
your
favor
instead
of
forcing
it
like
you
may
be
accustomed
to
by
willpower
or
waiting
on
motivation
you
will
settle
into
it
easily
naturally
and
almost
effortlessly
like
easing
into
relaxation
now
no
need
to
force
it
relaxation
happens
differently
for
everyone
often
the
mind
or
the
body
resists
pulling
back
just
a
little
or
a
lot
this
resisting
is
a
silly
habit
you
can
feel
free
to
let
go
of
at
any
time
because
what
you
really
crave
his
deep
relaxation
whether
you
resist
with
a
tense
body
or
busy
mind
let
me
assure
you
it
is
natural
it
's
better
to
release
the
urge
to
control
the
resisting
than
to
push
back
do
not
resist
the
resisting
let
it
go
let
nature
take
his
course
and
let
relaxation
find
your
body
ultimately
either
your
mind
or
your
body
will
release
it
first
releasing
the
effort
it
takes
just
to
relax
instead
it
will
resist
the
effort
it
takes
to
resist
and
simply
give
in
to
the
feeling
of
complete
and
comfortable
relaxation
the
kind
of
relaxation
that
soothes
your
mind
and
your
body
you
may
be
wondering
how
much
easier
would
be
to
just
relax
nestled
in
your
protective
corner
of
your
mind
wherever
relaxation
occurs
for
you
loosen
up
your
neck
and
shoulders
wiggle
or
slouch
into
your
seat
[
Music
]
now
is
a
good
time
to
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
exhale
releasing
tension
release
whatever
it
is
you
're
holding
on
to
feel
yourself
relax
deeper
on
the
exhales
another
nice
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
and
exhale
releasing
relaxing
deeper
into
relaxation
settling
deeper
into
your
seat
checking
whether
your
mind
or
your
body
feels
more
relaxed
right
now
is
your
mind
settling
into
the
background
or
your
body
releasing
tightness
whichever
it
is
see
if
you
can
notice
it
now
and
make
a
mental
note
of
it
body
relaxed
mind
relaxed
any
and
all
relaxation
is
progress
as
you
achieve
a
state
of
peace
[
Music

take
one
more
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
really
enjoying
the
process
like
a
vacation
and
exhale
let
the
tension
deflate
out
of
your
shoulders
your
back
your
hips
all
the
way
down
to
your
legs
relaxation
cascading
down
through
your
entire
body
washing
over
you
soothing
and
effortless
your
breathing
becomes
regular
and
easy
finding
a
natural
rhythm
for
you
gently
closing
your
eyes
if
you
have
n't
already
quieting
the
mind
pleasantly
distracted
with
a
simple
game
of
counting
backwards
starting
with
100
down
to
99
imagine
the
numbers
in
your
mind
as
you
count
down
98
97
96
down
to
90
watching
the
numbers
go
down
drifting
down
into
deep
relaxation
still
counting
[
Music
]
down
further
still
counting
your
way
backwards
and
to
relaxation
and
soon
you
spend
less
effort
on
counting
and
simply
watch
the
numbers
drift
on
and
on
and
you
can
lose
track
of
them
if
you
like
now
at
this
point
accomplishing
just
the
right
amount
of
relaxation
for
you
releasing
the
numbers
let
go
of
any
efforts
now
while
you
take
this
time
to
relax
and
learn
in
a
special
way
for
your
growth
your
personal
success
and
to
see
farther
beyond
what
you
have
ever
seen
before
listen
carefully
and
diligently
now
that
you
are
relaxed
in
your
own
way
I
can
let
you
into
a
sacred
space
of
growth
one
that
will
contribute
to
your
personal
success
you
can
almost
feel
it
now
relaxed
in
mind
and
body
you
can
let
these
learnings
soak
into
you
flow
into
your
inner
knowing
listen
now
to
this
universal
truth
people
grow
evidence
shows
all
people
can
purposely
change
and
grow
throughout
their
lifetime
leading
to
positive
effects
both
physically
and
mentally
you
can
grow
the
hand
you
were
dealt
is
just
a
starting
point
for
development
I
wonder
if
you
know
you
can
grow
through
mistakes
and
setbacks
too
that
's
called
learning
and
the
more
you
learn
the
more
you
can
do
and
the
more
knowledge
you
take
with
you
to
apply
to
your
future
success
you
can
grow
because
you
recognize
your
accomplishments
maybe
some
you
haven't
noticed
before
you
grow
because
you
feel
moved
by
possibilities
ignoring
what
you
think
is
impossible
you
can
say
I'm
exploring
this
and
just
trying
things
out
you
have
a
GPS
navigation
pointing
you
towards
something
good
at
all
times
like
an
inner
compass
you
can
now
see
golden
opportunities
thanks
to
your
focused
growth
mindset
that
you
continually
develop
and
expand
unexpected
events
and
happenstance
leads
to
new
opportunities
you
now
recognize
those
opportunities
considering
changes
you
've
always
wanted
to
make
they
show
up
as
a
reality
in
your
mind
now
the
seed
is
planted
for
things
to
be
set
in
motion
learning
from
your
difficulties
every
success
story
is
sprinkled
with
difficulties
learning
in
this
meditation
so
that
you
can
apply
it
to
your
life
learning
from
the
process
of
growth
in
order
to
grow
your
personal
success
discovering
and
focusing
on
your
definition
of
success
regardless
of
external
influences
learn
and
never
forget
or
take
for
granted
the
lessons
they
are
valuable
beyond
measurement
this
is
your
recipe
for
growth
and
now
I
want
you
to
see
what
growth
looks
like
open
your
mind
up
to
your
imagination
I
want
you
to
see
growth
to
see
it
presented
to
you
through
five
doors
just
ahead
of
you
imagine
what
those
five
doors
look
like
you
scope
them
out
before
approaching
perhaps
they
are
monotone
and
unassuming
or
colorful
and
eye-catching
are
they
made
of
wood
or
metal
or
any
other
door
material
notice
all
these
doors
appear
to
be
closed
from
a
distance
but
as
you
come
closer
step
by
step
you
experience
an
open
minded
attitude
open
to
possibilities
open
to
good
changes
open
to
learning
a
special
invitation
awaits
you
from
behind
each
door
you
ask
yourself
which
of
these
doors
looks
the
most
open
to
me
what
more
do
I
want
to
experience
open
any
door
and
investigate
any
number
of
opportunities
waiting
for
you
keep
this
in
mind
you
have
infinite
possibilities
for
growth
in
your
life
you
have
infinite
ways
of
achieving
your
personal
definition
of
success
you
may
not
continue
to
seek
out
what
every
door
offers
you
develop
the
knowing
and
intuition
to
leave
a
door
behind
when
it
no
longer
serves
you
there
are
plenty
of
opportunities
limitless
invitations
to
grow
begin
to
open
doors
in
your
own
life

by
step

by
day

yourself
up

ways
of
thinking
and

your
gaze
beyond
what
is
just
in
front
of
you

are
always
doors
for
you
to
open
opportunities
up
ahead

doors
will
be
there

name
meditation
for
recreating
yourself
and
your
life
this
meditation
is
based
upon
the
teachings
of
dr.
Joe
Dispenza
and
our
traditions
and
philosophies
of
the
Eastern
world
by
practicing
this
meditation
you
will
be
more
and
more
aligned
with
your
intentions
and
goals
unable
to
release
negative
thoughts
negative
emotions
patterns
habits
and
addictions
that
prevent
you
from
manifesting
the
reality
and
the
life
that
you
want
so
let
's
begin
find
a
comfortable
place
where
you
can
either
sit
or
lay
down
close
your
eyes
and
begin
to
disconnect
from
your
environment
disconnecting
from
the
sounds
around
you
the
objects
around
you
bringing
your
attention
and
your
energy
inward
becoming
aware
of
the
space
inside
of
you
in
space
the
space
inside
your
head
in
space
the
space
inside
your
neck
in
space
the
space
inside
your
chest
in
space
the
space
inside
your
abdomen
in
space
the
space
inside
your
whole
body
from
head
to
toes
in
space
the
space
around
your
body
in
space
feeling
yourself
dissolving
within
the
emptiness
the
blackness
of
space
empty
empty
as
you
continue
to
dissolve
in
space
floating
in
the
darkness
of
space
maybe
you
become
aware
of
some
thoughts
or
emotions
that
tie
you
back
to
the
past
to
the
image
of
who
you
've
believed
yourself
to
be
and
these
thoughts
are
tied
to
different
memories
people
places
times
in
your
life
and
as
each
and
every
one
of
these
farts
or
emotions
that
tie
you
to
the
past
comes
up
you
simply
notice
it
without
grasping
or
clinging
or
rejecting
and
you
give
thanks
for
this
experience
for
this
fall
for
this
emotion
this
person
in
your
life
is
event
in
your
life
and
as
your
heart
fills
with
gratitude
for
this
thought
this
event
this
person
this
situation
this
emotion
he
begins
to
dissolve
and
it
begins
to
move
further
and
further
away
from
you
moving
back
into
the
blackness
of
space
no
longer
resonant
with
you
no
longer
associated
with
you
as
you
thank
it
and
watch
it
become
smaller
and
smaller
in
the
distance
disappearing
dissolving
thoughts
of
I
ca
n't
I
'm
not
good
enough
I
'm
sick
I
'm
not
worried
I
'm
gon
na
lovable
I
'm
guilty
I
'm
wrong
I
'm
bad
and
as
you
thank
each
and
every
one
of
these
thoughts
the
emotions
associated
with
these
thoughts
the
people
the
places
the
times
associated
with
these
thoughts
as
you
think
and
as
your
heart
opens
they
move
further
and
further
away
becoming
smaller
and
smaller
dissolving
into
the
blackness
of
space
I
need
turn
every
time
that
one
of
these
thoughts
beliefs
fears
people
places
situations
memories
each
time
one
comes
out
you
think
it
you
open
your
heart
and
you
watch
it
completely
dissolve
release
back
into
the
blackness
of
space
no
longer
identified
with
you
no
longer
tied
to
you
no
longer
part
of
your
experience
because
you
choose
to
let
it
go
letting
go
of
the
fears
of
limitations
letting
go
of
the
pain
the
hurt
the
suffering
back
into
the
blackness
of
space
and
as
you
continue
your
journey
into
this
open
infinite
space
you
notice
a
beautiful
light
pure
white
light
very
shiny
very
bright
and
you
feel
pulled
to
it
attracted
to
it
and
as
you
connect
to
it
you
recognize
it
as
your
intention
the
most
meaningful
thing
that
you
want
to
achieve
in
your
life
right
now
whether

you
to
it

recognize
it
you
merge
with
it

the
first
six
tracks
are
about
going
within
we
will
begin
within
it
has
been
stated
by
many
wise
ones
throughout
history
that
we
are
vibrational
energetic
beings
we
are
going
to
start
the
process
of
awareness
of
the
unseen
part
of
ourselves
and
from
that
powerful
place
we
will
manifest
our
desires
by
using
our
thoughts
and
our
feelings
getting
right
into
that
feeling
place
when
manifesting
is
like
supercharging
your
desires
and
speeding
up
the
receiving
process
rather
than
just
repeating
ideas
and
affirmations
because
when
you
feel
it
your
brain
thinks
that
it
already
exists
then
the
law
of
attraction
brings
you
exactly
what
you
feel
it
is
our
intention
that
this
be
the
beginning
or
the
continuation
of
you
becoming
conscious
of
yourself
and
from
that
place
of
inner
awareness
to
create
an
extraordinary
life
for
yourself
just
by
being
who
you
truly
are

in

others
do
the

please
do
not
listen
to
the
first
six
tracks
while
you
're
driving
our
operating
heavy
machinery
the
last
six
tracks
are
about
telling
the
new
story
of
you
if
you
just
focus
on
the
reality
you
see
around
you
now
you
will
only
keep
getting
what
you
have
let
go
of
how
things
are
now
as
they
are
only
the
product
of
what
you
have
previously
thought
and
believed
you
can
create
your
life
however
you
wish
it
to
be
the
only
limitations
that
exist
are
the
ones
you
put
on
yourself
lay
the
foundation
of
your
new
improved
life
believe
it
is
possible
get
playful
with
your
imagination
you
might
feel
like
a
bit
of
a
crazy
person
when
you
start
or
you
may
feel
like
you
are
lying
to
yourself
but
all
that
you
are
doing
is
taking
your
attention
off
what
is
what
you
have
already
created
in
your
life
and
telling
a
new
story
that
will
show
up
the
more
you
believe
it
and
the
more
you
tell
it
the
trick
is
when
you

little
steps
to

properly
if

go
to

remain
in

place
of
your
inner
being
your
higher
self
listen
to
the
answers
and
they
will
come
the
quickest
way
to
retrain
your
thinking
is
not
necessarily
to
try
and
catch
every
thought
as
this
will
sometimes
be
extremely
overwhelming
anger
make
the
hole
deeper
so
simply
relax
if
you
notice
a
thought
that
does
n't
feel
good
which
means
it
's
not
in
alignment
with
who
and
what
you
really
are
then
relax
go
back
to
the
relaxation
meditation
let
go
release
imagine
letting
go
of
your
thinking
this
may
sound
like
a
contradiction
however
the
more
you
can
let
go
release
the
holding
the
trying
to
change
the
effort
the
fighting
the
more
you
will
allow
the
space
for
new
softer
thoughts
and
feelings
to
flow
release
your
thinking
relax
allow
space

moment
when
we
say
in

hearts
I
see
you
I
'm
grateful
to
you
for
listening
and
I
thank
you
for
your
openness
breathing
deeply
in
and
outwelcome
to
level
one
of
project
yourself
get
ready
to
start
tapping
into
an
ancient
technology
that
will
enable
you
to
unlock
the
powers
within
your
innermost
self
power
that
you
never
knew
even
existed
remember
keep
that
mind
of
yours
completely
wide
open
so
we
can
hack
the
confines
of
your
current
reality
because
only
then
can
you
reinvent
it
we
're
going
to
start
out
level
one
with
the
guided
meditation
now
before
you
think
it
's
gon
na
be
a
meditation
about
weird
things
and
all
that
now
let
's
be
realistic
it
's
actually
just
going
to
guide
you
to
get
you
into
the
right
mindset
so
that
you
can
experience
the
complete
level
in
its
fullness
now
we
're
going
to
call
these
project
forwards
and
the
reason
why
we
're
going
to
call
these
project
forwards
is
because
it
will
quite
literally
shift
your
mind
and
body
forward
into
everything
you
'll
be
experiencing
and
embodying
in
the
current
session
let
's
get
started
projecting
forward
start
in
a
comfortable
seated
position
on
the
floor
this
can
differ
for
many
people
for
some
it
may
be
cross-legged
for
others
who
may
be
kneeling
and
seated
upon
your
heels
in
either
rest
your
hands
at
your
knees
with
your
palms
facing
up
for
the
ability
to
receive
and
the
reason
why
we
're
going
to
have
your
palms
facing
up
is
because
it
's
been
scientifically
proven
that
your
palms
actually
contain
photons
they
can
actually
emit
photons
and
because
your
palms
contain
photons
that
means
it
can
receive
light
and
it
can
receive
energy
you
can
also
send
energy
from
there
we
just
have
to
learn
to
tap
into
the
energy
that
is
within
our
pumps
so
you
want
to
choose
your
setting
wisely
a
clutter-free
open
area
where
you
feel
your
Creator
can
shine
through
its
optimal
this
can
be
a
certain
room
in
your
home
or
even
in
nature
such
as
a
beach
or
a
mountaintop
keep
the
Sri
Yantra
in
front
of
you
laying
it
on
a
flat
surface
and
if
you
know
what
direction
you
're
facing
try
and
face
east
now
close
your
eyes
taking
a
deep
breath
slowly
let
the
breath
enter
your
nostrils
touch
the
base
of
your
throat
follow
to
your
chest
cavity
and
expand
at
your
belly
then
release
deeply
with
the
same
slow
intention
letting
the
breath
flow
out
of
your
body
and
nostrils
continue
to
let
your
breath
naturally
flow
in
and
out
in
this
way
the
journey
you
are
about
to
embark
on
is
with
your
avatar
and
your
soul
connection
it
's
your
connection
to
source
or
God
or
the
universe
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
it
's
your
connection
this
connection
is
your
guide
to
allow
you
to
openly
receive
this
level
now
become
aware
of
that
guide
see
that
guide
in
living
life
picture
how
he
's
she
or

what
kind
of
features
does
he/she
or

have
how
magnificent
is
that
creature

see
this
avatar
this
guide
is

the
one
that
already
knows
everything

the
one
that
knows
all
the
one
that
gives
you
all
the
security
you
need
to
make
the
right
decisions
to
feel
grounded

become
aware
of
being
with

connection
with
that
guide
with
that
avatar
now
imagine
yourself
standing
with
them
and
this
time
in
a
very
special
location
a
location
you
feel
at
peace
with
it
could
be
anywhere

of
scenery

is
100
%
peaceful
to
you
you
and
your
avatar
are
simply
sitting
in
this
location

this
peaceful
place
and
so
as
you
sit
there
and
become
present
to
this
you
realize
that
within
this
place
with
your

resides
your
ability
to
tap
into
infinite
power
and
true
abundance

in
with
awareness
to
allow
for
forgiveness
breathe

to
radiate
positivity

in
to
fill
yourself
with
gratitude
and
breathe
out

ultimately
let
go
of

to

to
the

of
your
spine

the
way
at
the
bottom
of
your
spine
your

deeply
into

there
and

for
a

out

the
squeezing
and
holding
for
another

counts

you
release

may
feel
the
energy
rising
up
from
your
spine
towards
the
crown
of
your
head

chakra
governs
our
survival
security
passion
money

and
everything
at
home

back
to
your

this
first
level

us
the

your

moving

on

breathe

relax
even
further
releasing
any
of

remaining

during

you

especially
aware
of
your
senses
.
the
feeling
of
the
surfaces
you
're
touching
against
the
amount
of
light
in

room
you
may
hear
detailed
sounds
that
may
have
otherwise
gone
unnoticed
and
all
of
these
are
fine
just
allow
yourself
to
experience
these
and
accept
them
without
judgment
just
take
that
time
to
find
the
centered
feeling
of
the
present

as
you
become
increasingly
aware

increasingly
centered
you
will
become
open
to
contemplate
our
topic
of
focus
for
today
being
the
boundless
finding
acceptance
and
being
your
best
self
What
does
it
mean
to
become
the
boundless
?
It
means
to
unlock
what
we
already
have
within
us
it
is
to
find
acceptance
within
ourself
and
with
our
surroundings
and
ultimately
it
is
to
make
way
for
our
best
self
to
shine
through
.
we
will
now
do
five
short
affirmations
or
short
phrases
which
you
can
repeat
after
me
either
out
loud
or
in
your
head
and
then
we'll
take
a
moment
of
silent
contemplation
to
reflect
let
's
try
this
now
repeating
after
me
and
allowing
yourself
to
become
more
and
more
present
here
in
this
moment
as
we
count
Five
:
I
welcome
this
moment
Four
:
I
become
present
Three
:
I
open
my
heart
and
mind
Two
:
becoming
my
best
self
One
:
becoming
the
boundless
when
we
talk
about
being
present
,
it
does
not
mean
that
we
can
not
actively
learn
from
our
past
and
future
it
means
that
we
avoid
the
unconscious
clutter
and
noise
that
fogs
our
true
path
looking
forward
actually
means
being
present
but
with
a
purpose
just
as
when
we
are
walking
we
understand
that
each
foot
is
placed
one
in
front
of
the
other
with
a
clarity
of
purpose
of
being
successful
through
that
clarity
of
mind
cutting
through
the
noise
of
our
unconscious
mind
.
And
so
,
with
these
ideas
present
we
once
again
count
using
our
affirmations
starting
now
.

I
welcome
this

Three
:
I
open
my
heart
and
mind
Two
:
Becoming
my
best
self
One
:
Becoming
the
boundless
Great
!
Now
as
you
go
forth
embrace
these
ideas
to
anchor
yourself
in
the
present
while
learning
from
your
past
and
looking
ahead
into
the
future
with
purpose
.
you
understand
how
failure
is
a
teaching
tool
and
how
we
must
learn
from
it
yet
also
let
them
go
you
understand
how
to
embody
success
to
clarify
your
goals
and
connect
deeply
both
within
yourself
and
others
and
you
understand
what
it
means
to
be
the
boundless
to
become
your
best
self
and
lastly
going
forward
we
remind
ourselves
to
be
grateful
for
the
earth
for
good
fortune
for
good
deeds
we
take
all
of
this
with
us
as
we
move
forward
into
the
days
and
weeks
to
follow
And
so
,
counting
one
last
time
with
numbers
only
we
prepare
to
finish
this
session
and
continue
forward
with
a

once

and
relaxed
you
can
close
your

close
your

the
heaviness
of
the
muscles
around

the
muscles
around
your

are
so
relaxed
and
heavy
that
even
if
you
wanted
to
open
your

you
couldn't
allow
yourself
to
have
this
time
of
quiet
of
relaxation
and
begin
to
send
a
wave
of
relaxation
of
the

nature
as
the
relaxation
of
the
muscles
around
your

throughout
your
entire

from

of
your
head
all
the

down
to

you
sink
deeper

deeper
and
deeper
into
a
state
of
inner
peace
and
relaxation
as
you
sink
deeper

deeper
into
deep
relaxation
you
become
aware
of
the
space
around
your

the
vast
emptiness
of
space
around

allow
yourself
to
become

NOW
PLAYING
welcome
to
a
guided
meditation
for
focus
for
studying
on
the
clutter
of
the
mind
let
's
start
the
practice
by
finding
a
comfortable
seat
you
can
practice
this
meditation
right
where
you
're
planning
to
study
so
it
can
be
on
a
computer
chair
or
seat
in
the
library
or
in
the
bedroom
or
in
the
office
and
just
ensure
you
're
sitting
with
your
back
upright
but
comfortable
and
resting
your
hands
in
your
lap
let
's
start
with
our
eyes
open
and
taking
in
a
few
big
deep
breaths
breathing
in
through
the
nose
and
out
through
the
mouth
and
now
if
you
're
doing
this
meditation
in
public
such
as
in
a
library
or
school
[
Music
]
you
can
keep
your
eyes
opened
for
the
practice
just
maintain
a
soft
gaze
looking
downwards
otherwise
you
can
close
your
eyes
here
and
allow
your
breath
to
return
to
a
comfortable
pace
and
let
's
start
by
reflecting
on
the
reality
of
our
distraction-filled
world
there
's
so
many
things
competing
for
our
attention
but
we
ultimately
have
in
us
the
ability
to
maintain
control
over
our
minds
and
our
attention
so
let
's
start
by
setting
an
intention
for
this
practice
in
your
mind
repeat
the
following
may
i
have
a
focused
and
energized
meditation
session
and
now
let
's
turn
our
attention
to
the
breath
most
of
us
do
n't
notice
that
we
are
breathing
all
day
long
we
simply
forget
that
we
are
breathing
we
're
so
caught
up
in
our
days
and
thoughts
it
just
sits
there
in
the
background
without
us
noticing
so
let
's
bring
our
attention
to
the
breath
and
notice
the
sensations
around
breathing
and
you
do
n't
need
to
change
the
breath
here
just
allow
the
body
to
breathe
on
its
own
and
notice
it
watch
the
rising
and
falling
sensations
around
the
body
with
each
inhale
and
exhale
and
when
you
inhale
naturally
picture
yourself
breathing
all
the
way
down
into
your
toes
feel
as
though
the
air
travels
all
the
way
into
each
one
of
your
toes
on
each
in-breath
and
notice
as
you
do
this
as
you
watch
the
breath
and
maintain
this
visual
thoughts
and
feelings
may
arise
and
attempt
to
pull
your
attention
away
from
the
breath
just
like
distractions
in
the
world
that
attempt
to
pull
your
attention
away
while
you
study
but
we
can
notice
distractions
just
like
we
notice
the
breath
and
when
a
distraction
arises
we
do
n't
need
to
engage
with
it
or
follow
it
with
more
thinking
simply
allow
the
distraction
to
come
and
go
through
the
mind
and
then
return
your
attention
back
to
the
breath
and
now
imagine
that
when
you
inhale
you
are
breathing
all
the
way
into
each
fingertip
imagine
the
feeling
in
your
hands
as
the
breath
extends
all
the
way
into
each
fingertip
and
again
if
you
find
that
the
mind
has
become
distracted
or
lost
in
thought
if
it
's
planning
or
thinking
about
what
you
'll
be
doing
after
the
practice
do
n't
become
frustrated
or
attach
more
thoughts
to
these
thoughts
simply
notice
it
as
a
distraction
allow
the
thought
to
dissipate
and
then
return
your
attention
to
the
breath
and
now
i
want
you
to
bring
your
attention
to
how
you
are
feeling
right
now
notice
how
focused
or
unfocused
you
are
in
this
moment
there
's
no
judgment
needed
just
be
with
whatever
you
notice
and
when
it
's
time
to
focus
and
study
all
we
need
to
do
is
calm
the
mind
and
ground
our
attention
our
goal
is
to
keep
our
mind
with
the
task
at
hand
and
let
it
enter
a
flow
state
on
its
own
we
just
need
to
create
the
internal
conditions
to
allow
that
to
happen
but
this
also
means
creating
the
right
conditions
in
our
external
world
so
this
practice
focused
on
our
internal
worlds
but
outside
we
need
to
mute
our
phones
close
out
all
other
tabs
use
tools
that
allow
us
to
block
social
media
and
news
sites
create
the
conditions
both
internally
and
externally
for
a
successful
study
session
and
now
let
's
close
out
the
practice
by
setting
an
intention
for
our
studying
session
and
for
the
rest
of
our
day
so
in
your
mind
repeat
may
i
have
a
focused
and
productive
study
session
may
i
be
undistracted
and
concentrated
may
i
be
committed
to
my
studies
may
i
focus
effortlessly
and
now
open
your
eyes
you
've
just
completed
the
practice
for
studying
thanks
for
sitting
and
may
you
have
a
focused
and
productive
day
youhello
welcome
take
a
moment
to
settle
in
relax
as
we
begin
a
journey
through
time
your
eyes
and
breathe
i
am
your
guide
we
are
traveling
through
time
tonight
whatever
time
of
day
it
is
for
you

and
return
when
you
are
up
to
speed
and
ready
for
a
wonderful
journey
towards
incredible
peace
solitude
and
healing
i
'm
now
going
to
count
down
from
10.
each
number
we
are
becoming
more
and
more
relaxed
in
our
bodies
and
awareness
you
should
feel
quite
lighter
ten
nine
eight
seven
six
[
Music
]
five
for
becoming
more
and
more
relaxed
three
more
relaxed
bring
awareness
to
your
body
too
going
now
to
the
most
deepest
relaxation
we
have
felt
in
meditation
one
we
are
here
now
at
the
bottom
of
the
relaxation
scale
we
will
remain
here
until
the
meditation
and
guided
journey
to
atlantis
has
concluded
until
that
time
remain
grounded
and
relaxed
let
's
turn
up
that
imagination
now
we
are
now
ready
to
journey
together
through
time
discovering
many
unique
visits
and
sites
along
our
way
i
want
to
take
a
moment
now
and
thank
you
for
joining
us
along
this
journey
together
in
a
journey
of
discovery
and
healing
my
dear
friend
and
soul
the
best
journeys
are
accompanied
by
friends
and
guides
we
can
not
do
it
all
on
our
own
we
are
all
helping
each
other
along
the
way
and
you
will
soon
find
that
even
you
begin
turning
into
a
guide
yourself
towards
the
ending
of
this
journey
which
is
really
just
a
new
beginning
now
that
we
are
on
this
lower
level
one
of
the
relaxation
scale
we
are
now
tuning
our
minds
and
our
imagination
directed
towards
this
enlightened
healing
journey
imagine
now
a
time
portal
in
a
room
this
time
machine
is
eternal
and
has
the
ability
to
take
you
anywhere
you
choose
this
time
machine
will
always
be
with
you
wherever
you
go
you
'll
be
able
to
see
it
but
no
one
around
you
will
as
it
remains
in
multiple
dimensions
at
once
we
use
a
cloaking
mechanism
for
this
beautiful
time
machine
so
fear
not
gather
some
thoughts
now
on
where
you'd
like
to
go
stirring
up
this
imaginative
real
reality
i
am
your
guide
so
i
will
direct
us
appropriately
the
goal
here
is
to
find
the
palace
and
ruin
of
healing
i
've
heard
this
place
of
healing
is
located
in
the
city
of
atlantis
where
anything
is
possible
let
's
choose
to
go
there
now
i
've
routed
the
time
machine
for
ancient
atlantis
step
in
to
the
time
machine
now
the
door
is
closing
and
our
opportunities
fading
[
Music
]
you
'll
notice
the
inside
of
this
time
machine
is
very
pressure
sensitive
so
as
the
pressures
begin
to
change
do
n't
worry
about
that
it
's
normal
strange
visuals
and
sounds
now
accompany
your
presence
you
visually
see
what
the
travel
portal
wants
to
reveal
before
your
arrival
awesome
we
have
landed
[
Music
]
the
door
opens
now
step
[
Music
]
out
[
Music
]
now
this
is
the
real
deal
this
is
what
we
call
the
wonderful
ancient
atlantis
[
Music
]
so
[
Music
]
a
true
sight
now
is
n't
it
walk
along
with
me
in
this
place
the
people
have
fully
harnessed
the
limits
of
mind
bending
them
and
allowing
the
imagination
to
run
a
little
wild
in
good
ways
mostly
the
ancient
temple
i
heard
is
1
000
years
old
foreign
species
and
cultures
have
harnessed
the
inner
powers
inside
for
centuries
the
cool
part
is
we
are
allowed
in
due
to
the
unlimited
tethers
of
parallel
dimensional
realities
made
possible
by
the
inventors
of
this
time
portal
we
can
go
anywhere
and
honestly
do
anything
we
want
we
just
need
to
get
you
healed
though
as
it
is
my
mission
to
keep
this
journey
moving
along
steadily
as
we
walk
past
these
rather
strange
enlarged
monuments
notice
the
changes
in
color
these
are
vibrations
that
have
been
intersecting
with
foreign
frequencies
view
this
as
a
intersection
of
crossroads
but
rather
energetically
they
are
alive
actually
living
it
is
said
that
at
the
intersecting
point
here
it
has
a
higher
intelligence
than
the
combined
universe
this
energy
its
multiple
energies
they
notice
all
and
see
all
but
no
worries
we
are
allowed
here
if
we
were
n't
our
time
portal
would
have
collapsed
us
into
deep
space
[
Music
]
yeah
notice
those
animals
quite
rare
you
see
lions
with
foxes
half
human
half
rhino
here
in
atlantis
they
have
experimented
with
crossbreeding
anyways
that
's
for
a
later
conversation
it
ended
up
getting
them
into
some
trouble
with
the
planetary
councils
until
now
no
culture
has
lasted
this
long
with
such
ability
here
you
are
healed
instantly
these
rooms
and
towers
actually
accelerate
learning
ever
see
the
movie
the
matrix
it
's
like
that
but
much
faster
and
expanded
that
person
over
there
they
just
spent
1
000
years
on
the
solar
planet
necronian
learning
how
to
capture
time
continuums
in
order
to
spawn
new
suns
in
our
multiple
different
galaxies
sounds
like
a
walk
in
the
park
right
but
she
was
actually
present
the
whole
time
these
portals
are
like
contracts
if
you
begin
one
you
are
lawfully
tied
to
remaining
there
only
the
most
experienced
souls
enter
these
types
of
contracts
all
right
enough
scaring
you
let
's
see
here
there
is
the
ruin
of
all
energetic
healing
does
n't
look
like
much
that
's
because
it
is
cloaked
to
look
like
a
simple
cave
in
reality
this
is
a
portal
to
endless
possibility
and
potential
power
it
is
said
to
hold
all
of
the
knowledge
of
the
great
creation
and
beyond
this
is
where
it
is
said
that
life
first
began
shall
we
let
us
go
come
through
this
dark
room
holds
all
the
answers
imaginable
any
answer
i
know
it
's
rather
cold
in
here
but
they
'll
take
really
good
care
of
us
every
inch
of
this
underworld
is
lined
with
unique
malleable
consciousness
in
terms
we
understand
that
thought
creates
and
spawns
whatever
you
like
it
out
imagine
whatever
you
wish
[
Music
]
all
right
come
on
here
we
enter
the
forbidden
staircase
it
's
called
that
because
many
foreign
rulers
and
energies
have
tried
entering
without
rite
of
passage
those
souls
are
said
to
be
held
within
small
pebbles
around
the
walls
and
floor
everything
has
life
here
and
i
mean
everything
just
watch
your
step
it
sees
you
and
i
and
it
knows
all
possible
outcomes
anything
we
think
it
knew
prior
to
us
thinking
so
just
be
aware
there
it
is
the
pool
and
fountain
of
all
healing
quite
large
and
bright
it
is
lined
with
intelligence
far
beyond
our
capacity
to
understand
i
will
never
try
at
least
as
a
guide
this
is
where
i
stop
wander
this
place
for
a
moment
and
i
'll
still
be
here
but
only
my
voice
now
you
are
in
a
different
dimension
than
i
just
watch
the
pools
beside
you
very
intelligent
they
are
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
yeah
over
there
step
up
on
those
stairs
leading
to
the
circle
of
healing
do
n't
yet
step
onto
the
water
also
do
n't
worry
about
the
colorful
magnets
or
lights
spinning
overhead
[
Music
]
the
washing
process
as
they
call
it
will
erase
all
past
resentments
and
karma
from
your
energy
[
Music
]
it
has
to
do
with
frequencies
basically
it
frees
you
to
do
more
with
your
life
often
souls
come
here
if
they
can
no
longer
progress
through
time
they
live
in
constant
fear
remember
it
's
your
intention
that
manifests
here
nothing
else
the
power
can
only
do
what
you
allow
it
to
all
right
that
's
the
signal
those
lights
do
this
now
step
into
and
under
the
open
shower
head
clean
water
is
now
rinsing
you
from
head
to
toe
cleaning
any
and
all
debris
and
baggage
of
self-imposed
limitations
this
rinses
you
clean
of
all
impurities
of
bodily
illnesses
fears
doubts
and
disbeliefs
all
worries
it
carries
them
all
away
quite
the
sensations
are
n't
they
[
Music
]
oh
i
've
been
here
more
than
a
few
times
it
's
why
i
help
people
like
you
it
's
fully
rinsing
every
inch
of
you
from
all
pain
and
sorrows
any
stuck
energy
is
now
released
by
this
purification
definitely
effective
[
Music
]
that
shower
stopping
is
normal
that
means
that
you
have
washed
away
all
the
impurities
within
yourself
there
you
now
stand
there
you
are
my
lovely
soul
friend
walk
with
me
now
over
here
back
to
the
time
portal
i
know
it
's
a
little
hard
to
see
we
're
actually
in
here
already
walk
a
little
further
time
works
a
little
bit
different
here
that
sight
there
that
's
your
body
this
meditation
was
a
pleasure
truly
revisit
often
i
'll
always
be
your
guide
and
friend
to
help
you
solve
life's
ongoing
worries
you
would
n't
believe
how
many
different
spirits
and
souls
i
see
journeying
here
to
find
rest
well
it
's
now
time
to
go
back
and
rest
my
dear
one
take
this
adventure
and
new
enlightening
perspective
and
share
it
i
must
now
return
to
the
other
portals
i
hear
many
beings
calling
ciao

[
Music

you
good
morning
and
welcome
to
your
practice
i
'm
sarah
raymond
from
the
mindful
movement
and
i
am
truly
honored
you
have
chosen
to
allow
me
to
be
your
guide
this
meditation
is
designed
to
empower
you
if
you
are
feeling
stuck
overwhelmed
and
anxious
and
if
you
are
motivated
for
change
yet
feeling
limited
by
your
beliefs
today
is
a
new
day
and
a
new
opportunity
to
gain
clarity
in
a
time
of
personal
growth
i
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
choose
a
relaxed
seated
posture
with
your
spine
upright
if
possible
[
Music
]
perhaps
on
a
cushion
on
the
floor
a
chair
against
a
wall
or
on
a
couch
close
your
eyes
if
you
'd
like
or
simply
soften
your
gaze
start
to
shift
side
to
side
gently
in
your
seat
feel
the
movement
of
your
attention
from
one
side
to
another
move
this
shifting
upward
to
your
waist
then
see
if
you
are
able
to
move
the
wiggle
up
to
your
ribs
[
Music
]
and
then
shoulders
then
maybe
even
a
small
movement
side
to
side
at
the
height
of
your
neck
and
then
your
head
take
a
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
then
let
out
an
audible
sigh
exhale
as
you
settle
into
stillness
become
aware
of
the
feels
in
your
body
the
sensations
perhaps
you
sense
a
buzzing
or
tingling
as
the
energy
from
your
movement
continues
yet
your
physical
body
becomes
still
as
if
there
is
a
momentum
within
you
that
takes

deep
breaths
at
your

pace
continuing

settle

inhale
through
your
nose
and
let
out
an
audible
exhale
a
sigh
or
ha
sound
or
perhaps
make
a
humming
noise
on
your
exhale
[

noise
creates
vibration
in
your

and
it
is

to

[

after
a
few
cycles
let
your
breath
return
to
its
effortless
rhythm
invite
a
softening
of
your
outer
layer
to
wash
over
you
perhaps
you
might
imagine
the
removal
of
armor
put
there
to
protect
you
yet
here
you
are
safe
it
is
okay
to
let
go
of
this
armor
for
a
bit
or
consider
what
it
might
feel
like
to
blur
your
edges
as
if
a
camera
lens
is
changing
focus
you
are
still
you
you
are
safe
you
are
simply
letting
go
of
the
rough
hard
edges
as
you
continue
to
relax
and
soften
in
your
mind
visualize
a
doorway
or
an
entrance
of
sorts
this
can
be
a
doorway
you
have
been
to
before
or
one
that
exists
only
in
your
mind
[

this
may
show
up
as
a
memory
or
as
if
it
is
a
picture
in
your
mind
[
Music
]
if
nothing
specific
comes
to
mind
simply
use
the
idea
of
a
door
this
door
represents
your
opportunity
to
grow
to
move
forward
to
make
the
change
in
your
life
that
you
desire
this
is
the
metaphorical
threshold
you
may
be
having
trouble
crossing
in
your
own
life
perhaps
something
related
to
business
a
relationship
your
home
life
a
creative
endeavor
[

as
this
image
becomes
clearer
in
your
mind
you
can
also
see
yourself
in

of
this
doorway

yourself
standing
in

you
to
the
next
step
in
your
life
you
see
that
you
are
holding
many
items
in
both
of
your
hands
it
becomes
clear
that
you
can
not
open
this
door
unless
you
are
willing
to
put
some
things
down
breathe
slowly
and
continue
to
relax
and
connect
with
the
feeling
that
you
are
safe
these
items
you
are
holding
represent
any
and
all
beliefs
obstacles

responsibilities
that
are
holding
you
back
knowing
that

consider
what
is
a

to
fully
arrive
in
this
moment
by
tuning
into
your

body

note
what
it
feels
like
to
be
in
your
body

to
be
supported
by
this
place
that
holds
you
now
drawing
your
attention
to
your
breath
minding
the
unconscious
stream
of
life
force
that
continually
flows
through
you

to
breathe
there
is
nothing
you
need
to
actively
do

breath
is
guided
by
an
innate
consciousness
that
supports
the
life
in
all
of
us

simply
observe
it
simply
pay
attention
to
its
effortless
presence

the
way
it
flows
in
and
watch
the
way
it
flows
out

mind
has
drifted
into
unrelated
thoughts
simply
guided
back
towards
the
words
spoken
here
or
to
the
anchor
that
is
your
breath
now
before
we
move
into
a
visualization
to
cultivate
positivity
before
sleep
let
's
take
some
time
to
harness
the
power
of
the
breath
because
even
though
we
do
not
need
to
control
or
engage
the
breath
in
any
way
in
order
for
it
to
function
we
can
consciously
direct
the
breath
in
various
ways
to
support
deeper
healing
for
instance
as
we
mindfully
invite
the
breath
into
the
belly
we
initiate
the
body
's
relaxation
response
and
interfere
with
the
fired
flight
freeze
response
that
can
chronically
take
over
our
lives
we
can
also
use
the
breath
to
consciously
cleanse
ourselves
of
any
negative
thoughts
or
beliefs
that
impede
with
the
experience
of
vitality
and
empowerment
to
practice
this
just
take
a
couple
more
natural
mindful
breaths
at
your
own
pace
and
after
your
next
exhalation
I
invite
you
to
imagine
that
as
you
inhale
you
take
in
a
bright
white
light
from
the
universe
that
surrounds
you
and
as
you
exhale
imagine
any
mental
or
emotional
debris
leaving
your
body
inhale
the
white
healing
light
of
the
universe
and
exhale
any
heavy
stagnant
or
negative
energy
that
may
be
holding
you
back
from
being
or
that
you
are
continue
breathing
in
this
way
for
a
little
longer
and
as
you
do
I
invite
you
to
be
patient
and
compassionate
with
yourself
throughout
this
process
we
are
all
subject
to
experiencing
negative
or
limiting
thoughts
and
feelings
so
if
it
feels
that
negative
energy
has
been
culminating
in
you
recently
know
that
this
is
nothing
personal
and
in
fact
it
is
nothing
bad
or
wrong
rather
when
we
become
aware
that
we
have
been
holding
on
to
negative
or
self-limiting
energy
we
are
blessed
with
the
opportunity
to
move
beyond
it
awareness
of
negative
energy
in
this
way
acts
as
a
catalyst
for
deep
transformation
so
take
just
three
more
for
cleansing
breaths
now
inhaling
light
and
exhaling
any
heaviness
or
darkness
and
after
you
finish
that
third
exhalation
let
your
breath
come
back
to
its
natural
pace
depth
and
rhythm
having
established
a
groundwork
of
inner
light
and
positivity
let
's
begin
our
journey
into
a
visualization
of
positive
transformation
so
take
a
moment
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
mind
's
eye
honoring
this
space
within
you
for
its
incredible
capacity
for
visualization
clear
away
any
images
or
ideas
that
might
be
held
here
and
on
the
empty
canvas
left
behind
I
invite
you
to
imagine
that
you
are
standing
in
a
wintry
forest
somewhere
not
far
from
the
outer
reaches
of
the
Arctic
Circle
the
sky
is
dark
and
a
deep
silence
permeates
the
forest
snow
covers
the
ground
and
though
it
is
cold
out
you
are
well
bundled
and
prepared
for
this
journey
standing
with
your
feet
firmly
rooted
into
the
snow
packed
trail
beneath
you
you
stand
tall
and
take
a
deep
full
breath
into
your
belly
and
they
let
it
back
out
another
long
deep
breath
into
the
belly
and
then
back
out
and
you
take
a
third
and
final
breath
in
of
this
crisp
clean
pine
infused
air
and
let
it
all
go
with
a
sigh
you
begin
now
your
journey
on
the
path
ahead
you
tread
slowly
and
mindfully
open
to
the
wonder
of
this
remarkable
midnight
landscape
as
you
walk
through
this
quiet
uninhabited
land
you
feel
a
sense
of
the
infinite
possibilities
of
the
universe
stars
and
the
moon
that
shined
down
on
you
from
up
above
remind
you
of
the
magic
and
mystery
of
the
cosmos
the
cosmos
that
you
are
an
integral
part
of
all
of
the
world
's
challenges
and
your
own
challenges
seem
to
fall
from
your
shoulders
as
you
make
your
way
through
this
vast
and
natural
landscape
it
may
not
be
that
the
difficulties
go
away
completely
however
your
fear
and
resistance
to
these
challenges
diminishes
with
each
step
you
take
across
the
forest
floor
in
their
place
confidence
courage
and
a
positive
outlook
on
life
arises
you
continue
to
weave
through
the
pines
and
spruce
trees
though
it
is
quite
dark
your
eyes
are
well
adjusted
thanks
to
the
help
of
the
glowing
full
moon
above
you
are
not
quite
sure
how
or
why
you
've
arrived
at
this
place
but
you
sense
that
you
were
being
called
to
take
a
step
back
from
the
gritty
details
of
life
and
to
consider
yourself
your
life
and
the
universe
from
a
fresh
perspective
here
in
this
near
Arctic
forest
you
find
space
to
breathe
and
indeed
you
begin
to
develop
a
clearer
broader
view
of
things
a
leap
away
from
the
day-to-day
routines
and
habitual
modes
of
thinking
the
weight
of
the
world
you
've
been
carrying
dissolves
here
in
this
forest
you
feel
yourself
awakening
to
your
divine
presence
and
to
the
divinity
that
lives
within
all
beings
and
within
the
earth
itself
you
breathe
deeper
now
letting
each
breath
continue
to
cleanse
any
negative
thoughts
or
beliefs
that
no
longer
serve
you
as
you
walk
a
little
further
through
this
enchanted
landscape
you
begin
to
absorb
all
of
its
wonder
beauty
and
blessings
you
take
in
the
freshness
of
the
snow
that
covers
the
earth
and
the
treetops
you
relish
in
the
sound
of
this
snow
crunching
beneath
your
feet
and
you
sink
into
the
silence
that
pervades
the
entire
forest
absorbing
the
herbal
aroma
of
the
pine
and
spruce
trees
your
mind
is
awakening
to
all
of
the
details
of
this
landscape
and
to
the
beauty
in
the
simplest
of
things
soon
you
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
coming
upon
a
small
clearing
in
the
land
the
small
field
is
covered
in
snow
and
at
the
opposite
end
of
it
a
cabin
awaits
you
slowly
you
cross
the
field
paying
attention
to
the
crunching
snow
of
each
step
and
as
you
arrive
at
this
humble
abode
you
discover
a
small
fire
pit
just
outside
the
front
door
that
is
cleared
prepped
and
ready
to
be
lit
in
the
small
shed
just
a
few
meters
away
from
the
fire
pit
you
discover
a
small
brass
matchbox
holder
as
well
as
a
warm
knitted
blanket
you
grab
both
and
head
back
towards
the
edge
of
the
pit
kneeling
down
beneath
the
starry
sky
you
strike
a
match
and
set
the
bundle
of
twigs
on
fire
you
watch
as
the
flame
slowly
consume
these
thin
branches
and
then
you
place
two
logs
atop
the
burning
pile
you
wrap
yourself
in
the
warm
blanket
and
then
sink
back
into
the
wooden
armchair
in
front
of
the
fire
[

the
crackling
flames
pierced
the
silent
night
with
grace
you
welcome
the
noise
as
it
settles
the
soul
and
awakens
the
heart
and
as
you
rest
here
gazing
into
the
amber
glow
of
flames
and
coal
you
sense
the
possibility
of
transformation
that
rests
before
you
this
element
you
gaze
into
is
the
holder
of
new
life
bearing
the
capacity
to
alkalize
parts
of
you
that
are
ready
for
change
fire
ignites
our
personal
power
and
calls
us
to
new
beginnings
and
so
hearing
its
call
you
offer
to
this
fire
any
negative
thoughts
stories
or
beliefs
that
hold
you
back
from
moving
positively
and
courageously
into
the
future
you
might
consider
beliefs
that
hold
you
back
from
experiencing
positive
loving
relationships
or
you
might
consider
those
that
hold
you
back
from
success
and
achieving
your
wildest
dreams
or
you
might
reflect
upon
the
negative
thought
patterns
that
hold
you
back
from
cultivating
your
greatest
capacity
the
spiritual
emotional
and
physical
well-being
whatever
arises
you
offer
to
the
fire
what
no
longer
serves
you
casting
those
limiting
negative
thoughts
into
the
fire
to
be
transformed
when
nothing
else
is
left
to
be
released
you
let
yourself
bask
in
the
fire
's
warm
glow
your
belly
softens
your
shoulders
relax
and
you
compassionately
witness
whatever
is
now
moving
through
you
sometimes
clearing
out
space
for
a
more
positive
mindset
feels
exhilarating
and
empowering
sometimes
this
process
creates
momentary
confusion
sadness
or
other
challenging
emotions
whatever
is
present
for
you
honor
your
experience
by
tending
to
it
with
patience
and
compassion
just
allow
these
waves
to
come
and
go
it
and
flow
you
lean
your
head
back
against
the
upper
surface
of
the
chairs

and
as
you
shift
your
gaze
away
from
the
fire
and
into
the
night
sky
it
appears
the
radiant
glowing
alchemical
Northern
Lights
neon
green
indigo
and
fuchsia
bursts
of
light
dance
in
the
cosmos
above
you
watching
them
play
in
the
night
sky
you
feel
an
immense
wave
of
gratitude
washed
through
you
as
well
as
a
sense
of
magic
and
infinite
possibility
you
realize
that
the
world
is
much
more
than
it
seems
and
that
even
when
things
are
dark
there
are
always
traces
of

be

from
the
fires

to
the

the

sometimes
we
unknowingly
begin
to
identify
ourselves
based
on
our
pain
or
physical
limitations
and
by
identifying
with
these
areas
of
dis-ease
we
can
hold
ourselves
back
today
be
kind
to
yourself
think
loving
thoughts
and
love
your
body
let
go
of
labels
of
past
pain
or
disease
as
well
as
limitations
[

and
now
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
choose
a
position
where
you
can
settle
into
effortless
ease
allow
your
hands
to
rest
easy
and
close
your
eyes
if
you
wish
maybe
you
feel
drawn
to
deepen
your
connection
and
would
like
to
place
your
left
hand
on
your
heart
and
your
right
hand
on
your
belly
choose
whatever
position
is
calling
to
you
make
the
small
subtle
adjustments
in
position
and
muscular
tension
to
relax
completely
and
now
take
a
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
sending
the
breath
all
the
way
down
the
length
of
your
spine
and
breathe
out
like
a
sigh
through
your
mouth
releasing
any
residual
stress
or
tension
let
's
do
this
together
one
more
time
deep
breath
in
and
sigh
it
out
feel
your
body
soften
and
relax
as
you
enter
the
familiar
state
of
relaxed
introspective
awareness
and
allow
your
breath
to
return
to
its
automatic
pattern
during
this
time
that
you
have
set
aside
to
care
for
yourself
the
world
will
go
on
around
you
there
will
be
sounds
around
you
and
thoughts
that
come
into
your
mind
simply
acknowledge
them
and
allow
them
to
be
part
of
the
background
as
you
invite
your
awareness
inward
bring
your
attention
to
your
breath
as
it
flows
in
its
natural
rhythm
without
changing
or
forcing
any
expectation
of
what
it
should
be
notice
its
path
notice
its
tempo
and
notice
its
fullness
perhaps
your
breath
is
beginning
to
slow
down
and
deepen
as
you
relax
or
maybe
you
feel
the
breath
becomes
shallow
or
even
pause
momentarily
[
Music

whatever
you
're
experiencing
is
perfect
simply
be
with
the
sensations
as
they
arise
notice
the
movement
of
your
body
connected
to
your
breath
rhythm
perhaps
a
rise
and
fall
of
the
chest
and
abdomen
flowing
in
connection
with
each
inhale
and
exhale
continue
to
practice
sensing
the
breath
for
the
next
few
moments
of
silence
lovingly
returning
your
focus
if
the
mind
follows
a
thought
or
sound
into
story
inviting
your
attention
now
to
move
slowly
and
deliberately
to
your
physical
sensations
begin
at
the
top
of
your
head
and
scan
the
sensations
of
your
body
from
the
inside
with
a
fluid
attention
all
the
way
down
to
the
soles
of
your
feet
as
your
attention
passes
over
each
part
of
your
body
encourage
a
release
a
letting
go
of
any
tension
once
your
awareness
reaches
your
feet
bring
it
back
to
the
top
of
your
head
and
begin
again
this
time
notice
any
areas
of
pain
or
discomfort
and
simply
be
with
the
sensations
without
labeling
or
telling
a
story
of
why
breathe
into
these
areas
and
invite
a
sense
of
ease
and
release
notice
if
you
skip
over
or
avoid
any
areas
and
as
you
scan
or
feel
judgment
about
a
particular
area
welcome
anything
and
everything
that
you
are
feeling
and
thank
your
body
for
its
ability
to
feel

half
hour
or
so
open
your
mind
and
your
heart
to
the
possibilities
of
a
life
of
your
dreams
we
will
begin
by
letting
go
of
tension
and
holding
in
our
physical
body
so
we
can
let
go
of
holding
on
to
expectations
judgements
or
being
attached
to
specific
outcomes
in
our
mind
when
your

is
space
for
possibilities
to
arise

more
easily
connect
with

self
I
invite
you
to
make
yourself
comfortable
making
any
subtle
adjustments
to
your
body
to
soften
close
your
eyes
and
bring
your
awareness
-
the
automatic
process
of
your
breath
while
noticing
your
breath
begin
to
look
inside
yourself
for
anywhere
you
can
let
go
of
the
tendency
to
hold
on
let
the
weight
of
gravity
sink
into
your
body
to
deepen
your
relaxation
give
in
to
the
support
beneath
you
allow
relaxation
into
your
body
and
peace
into
your
mind
once
you
are
calm
you
can
connect
to
your
heart
and
invite
the
version
of
your
wisest
and
truest
self
to
come
to
the
surface
[
Music

as
your
truest
self
surfaces
I
will
guide
you
to
relax
even
more
deeply
begin
to
breathe
intentionally
more
fully
and
count
your
breath
[
Music

your
inhale
is
one
and
your
exhale
is
two
counting
up
to
10
and
then
back
down
again
stay
with
your
breath
count
and
allow
your
mind
to
begin
to
calm
[
Music

[

allow
your
breath
to
relax
to
its
natural
rhythm

go
of
the
counting
with
a
relaxed
awareness
look
for
any
areas
of
your
body
you
can
relax
from
the
inside
are
there
any
places
within
you
that
you
can
soften
[
Music

since
the
soles
of
your
feet
release
as
well
as
your
toes
the
tops
of
your
feet
and
ankles
allow
this
release
to
move
up
to
your
calves
your
knees
your
thighs
and
your
hips
[
Music

continue
to
soften
your
stomach
your
back
your
chest
and
your
arms
welcome
this
relaxation
to
linger
and
extend
at
the
area
of
your
throat
and
neck
as
well
as
over
your
entire
face
[
Music

your
jaw
and
your
scalp
to
feel
complete
ease
in
your
body
[

look
for
relaxation
without
the
need
to
control

ease
to
move
over
your
body
when
it
comes
in
its
own
time
so
it
's
not
forced
[
Music

as
you
become
relaxed
I
will
guide
you
through
a
visualization

practice
is
not
about
perfection

not
feel
aligned
with
the
life
of
your

okay
[

what
you
want

you
imagine
this

vivid
pictures
in
your

you
may
find
emotions
arising
within
you

you
have
specific
answers
to
some
of
the
questions

may
come
later

with
everything
that
is
coming
up
for
you
today

possibilities

another
10
seconds
amazing
you

incredible
that
's
three
minutes
now
take
a
moment
to
think
about
three
different
things
different
moments
in
your
life
where
you
felt
gratitude
picture
one
of
those
things
right
now
see
it
hear
it

it

what
you
saw
what
you
heard
what
you
felt
and

moment

the
grateful
flow
coming
from
your
heart
into
your
head

through
your
body

it
gratitude
is
so
powerful
and
you
can
take
that
memory
and
just
bring
it
to
life
as
we
move
on
to
the
second
thing
in
your
life
that
you're
you
're
grateful
for
it
could
be
a
person
it
could
be
an
experience
that
you
had
where
you
felt
so
grateful
so
much
love
love
is
this
supreme
emotion
and
we
experience
love
when
we
feel
gratitude
see
what
you
saw
hear
what
you
heard
back
then
or
feel
what
you
feel
when
you

of
this
experience
or
this
person
emotionalize
that
right
now

every
cell
of
your
body

that
gratitude
flow
yourself
up
right
now
bring
the
memory
of
the
person
to
life
better
than
ever
[
Music
]
as
we
now
move
on
to
the
third
experience
or
person
that
you
feel
or
people
that
you
feel
so
much
gratitude
for
see
it
hear
it
feel
it
turn
it
up
emotionalize
it
be
inspired
take
control
of
your
mind
your
body
your
emotions
feel
that
power
that
energy
flow
allow
your
nervous
system
to
get
fired
up
and
feel
that
flow
and
wear
that
smile
as
you
train
your
mind
like
you
never
have
done
before
and
right
now
as
you
take
those
three
things
those
three
moments
those
three
people
whatever
it
is
for
you
and
put
it
all
together
and
feel
that
connection
between
your
brain
and
your
heart
allow
yourself
to
feel
more
gratitude
than
you
felt
before
give
that
gratitude
a
color
and
send
that
color
to
every
part
of
your
body
as
you
fill
yourself
up
and
you
take
that
feeling
and
you
double
that
feeling
and
you
triple
that
feeling
and
you
quadruple
the
feeling
to
the
point
where
gratitude
is
coming
out
of
your
body
in
front
of
you
behind
you
above
you
beneath
you
everywhere
and
send
that
gratitude
off
to
people
who
need
it
people
you
love
people
you
care
people
you
meet
every
day
people
all
over
the
world
as
you
beam
gratitude
out
into
the
world
the
attitude
of
gratitude
is
one
of
the
biggest
things
which
makes
the
biggest
difference
to
the
world
that
's
right
and
now
let
's
think
of
three
things
in
your
life
that
you
want
to
have
happen
things
that
you
're
working
on
pick
one
of
them
and
see
it
in
the
future
it
doesn't
matter
how
clear
that
is
it
's
just
an
idea
but
what
brings
an
idea
to
life
is
your
ability
to
smile
to
feel
grateful
and
to
see
that
thing
having
been
done
with
clarity
with
a
sense
of
faith
what
is
faith
it
's
your
ability
to
see
what
it
is
that
you
want
to
have
happen
even
before
it
's
done
and
feel
that
dynamic
tension
of
being
drawn
towards
the
thing
that
you
want
to
have
happen
in
your
life
feel
it
be
it
become
it
as
you
right
now
focus
on
the
next
thing
in
your
life
that
you
want
to
finish
or
complete
and
see
it
as
if
it
's
already
been
done
as
einstein
said
reality
does
n't
exist
in
the
outside
world
reality
exists
inside
your
own
head
and
the
people
who
achieve
things
are
the
ones
who
have
the
foresight
like
you
have
now
to
see
what
it
is
that
you
're
working
on
having
been
completed
you
owning
that
thing
that
's
it
see
it
hear
it
feel
it
emotionalize
the
fact
that
you
have
already
achieved
what
it
is
that
you
're
working
on
give
it
more
life
give
it
more
substance
give
it
more
meaning
become
one
of
the
two
percent
of
people
around
the
world
it
uses
their
imagination
the
workshop
that
we
have
inside
our
minds
and
body
the
gift
of
creation
and
now
think
of
the
third
thing
or
maybe
it's
one
of
the
first
two
you
're
just
gon
na
do
it
again
it
really
is
up
to
you
something
that
you
want
to
see
done
finished
completed
be
grateful
for
the
fact
that
you
now
are
able
to
see
this
feel
it
and
step
into
it
like
it
's
already
been
done
you
have
this
ability
you
're
doing
it
right
now
feel
the
feeling
of
completion
your
ability
to
take
an
idea
take
the
feeling
like
it
's
already
been
done
and
just
just
to
get
on
and
make
it
happen
it
's
all
about
action
emotionalize
it
feel
that
tension
that
is
a
positive
tension
that
draws
you
towards
where
it
is
that
you
want
to
go
you
are
amazing
you
are
awesome
well
done
take
a
few
minutes
once
again
to
focus
on
your
breath
as
we
bring
this
little
training
because
this
is
what
this
is
this
is
my
365.
this
is
you
working
on
being
the
very
best
that
you
can
be
we
have
this
old
brain
in
an
incredible
body
with
a
heart
and
for
us
to
make
our
brains
and
hearts
work
together
much
more
effectively
we
have
to
train
train
ourselves
to
thrive
this
is
10
minutes
of
your
time
your
valuable
time
you
make
a
difference
take
all
of
this
bring
it
all
together
allow
your
whole
body
to
come
alive
your
mind
your
body
your
soul
everything
emotionalize
it
anchor
it
what
i
mean
by
anchoring
it
is
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
maybe
clench
your
fists
or
stretch
your
arms
up
in
the
air
and
allow
yourself
to
feel
this
in
every
part
of
your
body
because
the
more
you
do
this
the
more
you
'll
feel
wonderful
the
more
you
'll
be
able
to
access
this
because
greatness
comes
in
many
forms
but
for
me
two
of
the
greatest
things
that
you
can
do
is
see
where
you
want
to
go
and
hear
it
and
feel
it
and
be
compelled
to
move
towards
it
and

which
character
traits
you
need
to
from
your
9
advisors
so
before
you
enter
into
the
room
of
the
nine
advisors
you
decide
on
which
character
traits
you
want
to
work
on
and
now
after
you
decide
that
you
get
a
good
sense
of
a
beautiful
feeling
inside
you
as
if
you
already
have
it
now
that
character
trait
that
capacity
that
strength
that
your
nine
advisors
represent
and
when
you
have
that
good
feeling
you
know
you
can
step
up
from
that
green
chair
it
is
the
green
light
to
step
inside
a
room
of
your
nine
advisers
and
you
can
take
a
seat
now
on
the
coastal
chair
the
empty
chair
which
is
always
free
for
you
to
use
which
means
you
are
in
contact
now
the
minds
and
unconscious
mind
in
the
field
of
the
nine
advisors
opening
up
now
which
means
you
are
filling
yourself
up
naturally
with
the
character
traits
of
your
nine
characters
you
can
have
conversations
you
can
ask
questions
with
your
nine
advisers
always
which
means
you
have
two
character
trades
now
which
means
you
take
the
actions

have
the
thoughts
and
feelings
identities
connections
with
spiritual
purposes
necessary

know
you
can
always
return
to
this
room
and
your
smile
is
growing
even
stronger
and
more
deeper
you
go
outside
the
room
and
you
see
the
table
where
it
says
plants

can
see

has
plants
all

good
morning
my
dear
commuters
good
afternoon
my
dear
commuters
I
remember
when
I
lived
in
Washington
DC
in
New
York
City
I
would
take
the
Metro
often
and
I
would
be
on
buses
sometimes
I
would
drive
in
but
this
is
not
a
meditation
for
when
you
're
driving
please
let
's
make
sure
we
're
taking
mass
transportation
of
some
sort
a
bus
a
cab
the
to
the
Metro
okay
so
today
I
want
to
focus
on
a
centering
meditation
for
the
commuter
we
're
often
packed
in
cars
in
these
carriages
or
packed
in
the
bus
and
we
want
to
feel
like
we
can
prepare
for
our
day
or
decompress
from
our
day
and
make
good
use
of
that
time
this
guided
meditation
is
for
you
let
's
get
started
all
right
so
let
's
go
ahead
and
get
your
earbuds
out
make
sure
your
earbuds
are
in
you
do
probably
do
n't
want
to
be
sharing
your
meditation
with
your
friend
next
to
you
make
sure
you
have
your
earbuds
ready
and
whatever
position
you
are
in
go
ahead
and
sit
up
nice
and
tall
and
that
means
to
if
you
're
standing
let
's
say
you
're
on
the
tube
and
you're
standing
you
can
still
be
listening
to
this
so
whatever
your
position
you
're
in
whether
seated
or
standing
go
ahead
and
stand
up
sit
up
nice
and
tall
and
take
a
moment
to
breathe
and
receive
and
let
your
eyes
be
soft
you
do
not
have
to
close
your
eyes
if
your
eyes
are
open
let
the
eyes
be
soft
so
it
's
not
a
laser
point
gaze
the
eyes
feel
soft
the
vision
is
soft
you
feel
you
start
to
feel
spacious
even
if
many
people
are
around
you
call
a
quality
of
spaciousness
and
softness
to
your
gaze
and
if
you
are
in
a
place
where
you
can
close
the
eyes
go
ahead
and
close
the
eyes
now
let
's
take
a
moment
to
and
receive
and
again
let
the
the
lungs
the
diaphragm
the
breath
be
spacious
right
we
're
breathing
in
through
the
nose
and
out
through
the
nose
allow
your
exhale
to
be
longer
than
your
inhale
so
right
now
we
're
backing
off
the
to-do
list
of
the
day
we
're
zooming
out
and
we
're
getting
a
big
spacious
picture
the
exhale
is
longer
the
gaze
is
soft
and
we
're
not
doing
laser
eye
laser
focus
at
this
point
we
're
backing
off
we
're
getting
a
big-picture
perspective
and
we
're
softening
you
're
not
going
to
lose
your
ability
to
do
things
let
's
get
that
clear
what
we
're
doing
now
helps
you
Center
so
you
can
do
what
you
do
better
it
's
important
time
let
's
Center
and
come
to
a
place
of
balance
to
being
you
can
do
it
so
you
breathe
and
receive
you
zoom
out
and
the
central
nervous
system
will
calm
you
can
come
to
balance
balance
your
beam
you
can
do
this
it
does
n't
need
to
take
a
long
period
of
time
you
can
breathe
and
receive
become
more
spacious
and
you
'll
feel
the
parts
of
your
being
you
'll
feel
the
central
nervous
system
calm
that
signals
to
the
mind
the
mind
will
calm
and
you
'll
start
to
center
in
this
quality
of
centeredness
bring
your
focus
to
your
mind
your
brain
is
malleable
you
can
affect
your
brain
when
we
're
under
stress
the
brain
shrinks
when
we
come
to
a
centering
meditation
when
we
expand
and
balance
our
being
the
green
feels
more
spacious
and
this
is
an
exciting
journey
you
are
literally
affecting
your
brain
function
you
're
lighting
up
parts
of
the
brain
that
may
have
been
dusty
so
we're
quieting
the
mind
we
're
drawing
the
breath
and
our
awareness
deep
in
the
center
of
the
skull
even
if
your
eyes
are
open
keep
the
gaze
soft
but
draw
your
awareness
to
the
center
of
the
skull
and
envision
the
center
of
your
skull
the
center
of
the
brain
as
fluid
open
and
pure
you
're
affecting
brain
function
parts
of
the
brain
are
getting
lit
up
right
now
this
is
scientifically
proven
by
the
way
in
MRIs
they
've
studied
people
who
meditate
they
've
studied
the
MRIs
the
brain
parts
of
the
brain
get
lit
up
and
really

your
awareness
again
deep
in
the
center
of
the
skull

realize
your

academic
potential

let
's
get
started
on
our
path
to
the
most
successful
academic
you
find
a
comfortable
chair
to
sit
in
or
a
bed
to
recline
on
create
a
dimly
lit
environment
for
yourself
this
is
a
time
for
silent
solitude
there
are
to
be
no
distractions
this
is
a
time
for
personal
growth
empowerment
and
development
please
avoid
bright
artificial
light
during
this
mental
journey
the
presence
of
natural
sunlight
is
perfectly
fine
some
people
prefer
during
this
exercise
lying
in
the
grass
on
a
sunny
day
experiment
and
find
the
environment
that
works
best
for
you
this
may
change
from
session
to
session
depending
on
where
you
are
and
your
mood
there
are
no
mistakes
that
can
be
made
in
this
process
no
one
is
judging
your
performance
no
one
is
grading
you
do
what
works
best
for
you
you
may
begin
with
your
eyes
open
or
closed
they
may
open
or
close
during
the
meditation
it
's
okay
be
relaxed
do
what
comes
naturally
to
you
let
's
begin
by
becoming
completely
aware
of
our
own
physical
body
we
will
begin
at
your
toes
be
aware
of
their
presence
but
let
them
be
totally
and
completely
relaxed
visualize
each
toe
begin
with
your
little
toe
and
move
centrally
one
by
one
to
the
big
toe
let
them
relax
feel
the
tension
of
the
day
flow
out
of
your
body
through
your
toes
just
relax
now
mentally
move
up
along
the
course
of
your
body
acknowledging
the
resting
position
of
your
feet
we
often
carry
stress
in
our
feet
they
serve
to
carry
our
bodies
through
the
physical
world
let
them
simply
relax
completely
and
totally
now
we
continue
to
move
upward
to
our
lower
extremities
the
legs
and
the
thighs
these
are
large
muscle
groups
that
work
hard
throughout
the
day
to
transport
us
give
them
a
rest
let
them
sink
into
the
chair
of
bed
let
go
release
the
muscles
consciously
unwind
feel
the
muscle
fibres
relaxing
now
considering
be
aware
of
your
buttocks
and
pelvis
we
often
hold
stress
here
as
well
relax
free
yourself
of
the
tension
you
Harbor
here
let
your
pelvic
floor
relax
and
release
this
is
a
wonderful
feeling
proceed
upward
to
your
core
the
abdominal
region
in
the
low
back
these
are
areas
we
often
work
hard
to
strengthen
and
tighten
now
is
a
time
to
let
them
be
loose
and
free
of
strain
take
a
slow
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
for
a
count
of
four
and
exhale
for
a
count
of
four
repeat
this
rhythmic
breathing
four
times
lowering
your
diaphragm
with
each
inhalation
filling
the
lungs
fully
with
fresh
oxygenated
air
be
quiet
in
this
process
avoid
excessive
noise
be
at
peace
within
your
own
body
as
it
is
at
the
moment
care
for
your
physical
self
embrace
who
and
how
you
are
right
now
remember
no
one
is
judging
you
please
do
not
stand
in
judgment
of
yourself
take
another
slow
deep
breath
for
a
count
of
four
exhale
for
a
count
of
four
empty
your
lungs
fully
on
each
exhalation
ridding
your
body
of
any
air
trapped
at
the
basis
of
your
lungs
think
of
how
cleansing
this
form
of
breathing
is
simply
take
the
time
to
relax
and
breathe
but
stay
in
the
moment
the
intent
here
is
not
to
fall
asleep
the
goal
is
to
be
living
fully
in
the
moment
in
acceptance
of
your
body
and
yourself
experience
the
joy
in
the
relaxation
and
self-acceptance
if
you
do
fall
asleep
do
n't
criticize
yourself
no
one
is
judging
you
this
is
not
a
test
this
is
a
self-awareness
exercise
this
is
a
journey
of
personal
development
stay
clear
and
attentive
but
remain
stress-free
and
relaxed
now
let
's
move
superiorly
to
the
chest
and
upper
back
this
again
is
a
large
muscle
zone
we
store
tension
here
let
everything
release
and
unwind
take
four
more
cleansing
breaths
remember
to
breathe
in
by
lowering
the
diaphragm
on
a
count
of
four
fill
your
ribcage
gently
expand
as
you
do
this
let
your
spine
lengthen
gently
and
let
go
of
all
muscular
tension
sinking
to
the
surface
you're
sitting
or
lying
on
feel
the
gentle
pull
of
the
Earth's
gravity
on
your
body
feel
the
natural
relationship
between
yourself
and
the
reassuring
force
of
nature
this
is
a
powerful
experience
finally
consider
your
neck
and
your
head
in
our
neck
and
face
we
store
stress
and
tension
unclench
your
jaw
relax
your
tongue
relax
your
eyes
gently
elongate
your
neck
without
straining
and
let
the
back
of
your
head
sink
with
its
natural
weight
into
the
pillow
or
cushion
you
are
completely
awake
but
totally
at
peace
you
are
completely
in
tune
with
yourself
now
again
for
slow
deep
breaths
in
through
the
nose
and
out
through
the
mouth
you
are
very
relaxed
and
completely
aware
of
your
entire
body
from
head
to
toe

your
true
destiny
welcome
back
to
your
daily
mini
meditation
today
we
're
going
to
be
meditating
on
the
concept
of
in
perfection
both
in
ourselves
and
our
lives
and
in
the
world
all
around
us
to
get
started
going
to
sit
in
a
comfortable
position
make
sure
you
're
in
a
place
that
you
know
you
're
not
going
to
be
disturbed
for
the
next
few
minutes
I
'm
gon
na
be
sitting
up
nice
and
tall
if
you
're
able
to
do
so
in
a
seat
without
a
backrest
so
that
you
are
under
your
own
strength
to
hold
yourself
up
you
can
have
your
feet
flat
on
the
floor
or
cross
in
front
of
you
and
your
hands
resting
gently
on
your
lap
or
your
legs
just
are
you
're
going
to
allow
your
attention
your
gaze
to
be
soft
directly
in
front
of
you
you
're
not
taking
in
anything
in
particular
you
're
not
judging
your
surroundings
or
allowing
yourself
and
your
consciousness
to
become
part
of
the
environment
now
allow
your
attention
to
come
into
your
breath
your
attention
and
your
breath
become
a
single
thing
you
'll
feel
your
body
begin
to
relax
muscles
in
your
face
neck
and
shoulders
your
torso
your
hips
and
legs
and
feet
all
beginning
to
soften
and
to
relax
now
in
the
quiet
of
your
mind
want
you
to
call
to
attention
an
area
of
imperfection
something
that
is
external
to
you
this
could
be
something
in
society
the
environment
other
people
anything
that
is
imperfect
these
things
of
imperfection
surround
us
and
is
precisely
in
the
imperfection
that
we
find
connection
to
them
we
are
imperfect
and
as
we
often
look
for
and
dwell
upon
the
imperfections
of
what
surrounds
us
the
things
in
the
world
we
find
the
same
reflected
in
ourselves
we
treat
those
imperfections
externally
with
the
same
hostility
that
we
find
in
our
perfections
internally
each
of
these
imperfections
are
opportunities
for
growth
and
for
change
and
for
improvement
we
can
improve
the
world
and
we
can
improve
ourselves
but
we
must
first
lay
down
our
weapons
of
hostility
that
we
use
on
ourselves
and
our
own
imperfections
that
is
the
only
way
that
we
will
be
able
to
confront
the
imperfections
of
the
world
in
an
effective
manner
we
accept
our
own
imperfections
without
hostility
and
without
judgment
we
understand
that
we
are
able
to
improve
we
understand
that
we
are
able
to
change
and
that
we
can
do
the
same
for
those
around
us
only
after
we
've
done
so
within
ourselves
I
'll
bring
your
attention
back
to
your
body
and
back
to
your
breath
allow
your
attention
to
surface
in
the
sensations
of
your
body
and
in
your
own
time
go
ahead
and
open
your
eyes
take
note
of
the
improvs
connection
that
you
have
both
with
yourself
and
those
around
you
we
are
surrounded
and
filled
with
imperfection
these
are
all
opportunities
for
grace
and
love
and
improvement
and
that
's
the
role
that
we
can
play
great
work
today
I
'll
see
you
back
here
tomorrow
your
thoughts
create
your
reality
and
you
have
the
power
to
change
it
uplift
your
mindset
and
uplift
your
life
with
affirmations
repeat
these
affirmations
for
at
least
21
days
and
let
the
power
of
your
mind
transform
your
life

.
They
ca
n't
even
.
Take
in
a
deep
breath
.
Now
breathe
out
.
Just
feel
the
fucking
nonsense
float
away
.
Take
full
,
deep
breaths
.
Breathe
in
strength
...
...
breathe
out
bullshit
.
Allow
your
breathing
to
discover
its
own
natural
,
unhurried
pace
.
If
your
thoughts
drift
to
the
three-ring
shit
show
of
your
life
...
...
bring
your
attention
back
to
your
breathing
.
And
with
each
breath
,
feel
your
body
saying
...
...
fuck
that
...
With
passive
acceptance
,
just
allow
distracting
thoughts
to
float
by
.
...
fuck
that
....
With
each
breath
you
take
,
your
thoughts
become
lighter
.
And
all
the
soul-eating
cocksuckers
just
...
...
fall
away
into
nothing
.
Take
a
moment
to
appreciate
the
silence
.
Those
assholes
can
’
t
piss
all
over
a
purity
like
this
.
You
are
weightless
.
Timeless
.
Without
beginning
...
or
end
.
Completely
relaxed
and
free
of
thought
.
And
as
you
slowly
open
your
eyes
...
...
greet
the
world
and
everything
in
it
with
a
new
,
beautiful
breath…
...
of
fuck
that.do
not
listen
to
this
recording
whilst
driving
or
whilst
operating
machinery
only
listen
when
you
can
safely
relax
and
bring
your
full
awareness
to
your
own
complete
comfort
oh
this
is
Michael
CLE
welcoming
you
to
this
session
this
is
the
second
of
two
guided
hypnosis
sessions
which
I
have
made
for
you
to
enjoy
listening
along
as
often
as
you
choose
and
to
assist
you
with
a
development
of
your
personal
athletic
mindset
this
second
session
is
intended
for
best
listening
during
those
moments
of
your
rest
and
recovery
sometime
during
the
same
day
after
you
have
performed
your
physical
weightlifting
workout
these
positive
suggestions
will
allow
both
your
body
and
your
mind
to
relax
and
renew
rebuilding
now
from
your
post
training
stimulation
because
you
can
trust
that
you
are
about
to
powerfully
set
all
of
your
deeper
Minds
intentions
towards
your
physical
replenishment
muscular
growth
and
you're
continuing
athletic
success
and
now
I
suggest
that
because
this
session
will
help
you
to
quietly
relax
and
repair
it
is
not
for
those
times
when
you
want
to
get
up
and
move
around
generating
energy
or
activity
those
suggestions
for
muscle
stimulation
and
energy
boosting
are
given
in
the
first
companion
recording
to
this
second
obsession
now
you
begin
close
down
your
eyes
just
as
soon
as
you
wish
and
as
you
better
relax
and
listen
carefully
to
my
words
my
voice
can
go
with
you
as
you
will
find
that
your
commitment
to
these
positive
self
suggestions
will
only
compound
and
continue
within
your
subconscious
growing
into
your
rest
your
recovery
your
nightly
sleep
and
Beyond
and
now
again
bring
your
attention
to
your
breath
by
starting
to
notice
those
slightly
longer
in-breath
and
the
slower
relaxing
out
breaths
as
you
breathe
in
calmness
and
you
breathe
out
all
tension
and
breathe
in
health
and
breathe
out
everything
that
is
not
health
calm
and
easily
relaxing
now
it
's
really
so
simple
to
let
yourself
relax
and
go
deeper
just
like
descending
a
set
of
comfortable
stairs
going
further
down
with
each
step
three
two
and
one
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
very
basement
of
your
total
relaxation
now
allowing
each
and
every
part
of
you
to
let
go
and
relax
as
this
time
is
the
time
for
your
body
to
release
and
further
let
go
this
time
is
the
opposite
time
of
tension
or
contraction
as
all
lactic
acid
and
that
remaining
residue
of
your
physical
muscular
activity
now
simply
flows
out
and
away
from
you
because
time
is
about
your
body
's
moments
of
repair
and
replenishment
all
of
which
comes
to
you
now
with
the
internal
flow
of
positive
soothing
comfort
and
as
all
of
your
muscles
release
just
like
a
handful
of
loose
limp
elastic
bands
you
know
that
the
more
your
muscles
relax
and
release
the
easier
it
is
for
all
of
those
vital
nutrients
to
flow
into
those
healthy
cells
and
the
more
you
feel
those
sensations
of
relaxation
developing
the
more
you
allow
yourself
to
rest
and
repair
and
easily
going
deeper
and
deeper
and
deeper
still
and
now
imagination
you
can
find
yourself
in
the
master
control
room
of
your
own
physiology
find
yourself
now
in
the
very
central
command
of
your
body's
functioning
however
you
would
like
to
imagine
it
and
perhaps
you
might
see
a
large
operations
room
just
like
a
space
shuttle
communications
panel
as
you
feel
the
vibrations
of
power
resonating
around
you
or
you
hear
now
those
reassuring
sounds
of
your
total
health
and
potential
or
perhaps
for
you
it
is
more
of
a
natural
and
organic
space
just
like
a
warm
cave
covered
with
healthy
mosses
and
leaves
as
healthy
crystal
water
drips
and
echoes
throughout
these
nurturing
surroundings
it
's
really
up
to
you
how
to
imagine
your
own
bodies
master
control
room
always
knowing
that
you
have
the
power
here
to
set
your
best
positive
intentions
and
now
as
you
continue
to
rest
and
relax
and
further
imagine
your
athletic
progress
you
find
that
any
negative
aspects
to
your
previous
strength
and
muscle
growth
are
now
being
eliminated
just
like
the
release
with
every
deeper
out-breath
as
that
air
flows
out
it
takes
with
it
all
of
those
old
limitations
and
negativity
and
with
each
passing
day
you
find
yourself
feeling
stronger
fitter
leaner
and
more
and
more
muscular
because
you
are
adopting
your
own
positive
mindset
and
your
own
powerful
outlook
each
day
you
experience
a
renewed
sense
of
energy
vitality
and
strength
because
you
give
now
all
of
those
commands
directly
to
your
master
controlls
and
just
by
setting
those
directions
you
find
you
look
confident
because
you
are
confident
you
feel
strong
because
you
are
strong
in
each
and
every
way
you
are
taking
the
time
to
improve
your
workout
performances
always
making
sure
to
rest
deeply
when
you
need
to
rest
and
to
train
with
focus
and
purpose
when
you
choose
next
to
train
naturally
easily
your
entire
system
functions
in
perfect
balance
and
harmony
and
always
you
sleep
well
and
deeply
at
night
so
that
your
body
and
your
mind
reflect
your
healthy
outlook
and
because
you
rest
so
easily
you
find
yourself
rejuvenating
after
each
training
session
always
you
are
growing
in
more
and
more
powerful
healthier
positive
ways
because
you
know
that
your
true
muscle
growth
occurs
when
your
body
is
deeply
here
at
rest
and
because
you
eat
healthily
you
choose
to
fuel
your
body
well
so
that
all
of
your
cells
your
nerves
your
muscles
and
deep
fibers
are
all
naturally
renewed
and
they
repair
themselves
automatically
and
when
it
is
time
for
your
weight
workout
to
end
you
find
that
you
take
just
a
few
moments
immediately
after
to
remember
to
really
visualize
your
muscles
best
recovery
and
just
by
enjoying
listening
to
this
recording
you
are
now
planting
the
seeds
to
rest
and
relax
and
grow
and
I
want
you
now
to
imagine
and
see
yourself
in
your
favorite
recovery
place
really
see
yourself
there
hearing
all
of
the
relaxing
soothing
sounds
around
you
and
feel
all
of
those
sensations
of
comfort
and
support
as
you
sit
or
lie
down
feeling
calm
satisfied
and
content
and
now
imagine
a
point
you
're
recovering
muscular
body
a
series
of
soft
hot
wet
towels
placed
down
over
your
recovering
muscles
placed
there
by
the
very
best
physical
therapists
in
the
world
so
that
those
towels
are
placed
down
onto
your
chest
muscles
and
you
now
feel
those
chest
muscles
release
and
relax
as
they
repair
deeply
and
now
back
muscles
feeling
those
Pleasant
swelling
sensations
of
growth
beginning
to
occur
and
now
your
shoulders
as
you
feel
those
towels
placed
down
over
all
three
parts
of
those
deltoid
muscles
and
now
your
arms
as
those
towels
cover
your
biceps
and
triceps
and
your
forearms
and
now
those
towels
are
placed
onto
your
thighs
those
quadriceps
and
hamstrings
and
/
pleasant
tingling
sensations
of
growth
simply
happened
now
as
those
muscles
deeply
repair
and
now
your
car
's
feeling
wonderfully
good
and
now
particular
muscle
group
that
you
may
choose
you
can
imagine
those
towels
being
placed
down
bringing
those
sensations
of
warmth
and
comfort
and
allowing
yourself
to
feel
that
wave
of
positive
energy
that
is
deeply
anabolic
and
now
direct
your
diva
mind
to
feel
all
of
those
soothing
healing
sensations
as
those
warm
towels
bring
improved
blood
flow
to
each
and
every
muscle
in
recovery
credibly
good
to
heal
and
repair
in
this
way
because
you
can
imagine
your
entire
physiology
just
like
a
giant
transport
system
so
that
all
available
blood
with
oxygen
and
nutrients
is
now
being
sent
to
your
recovering
parts
and
growth
hormone
itself
is
now
directly
filling
those
muscles
because
those
soft
heated
towels
are
bringing
you
increased
muscular
growth
and
now
as
you
take
this
time
to
really
enjoy
this
deep
relaxation
imagine
now
that
you
can
easily
step
out
into
your
future
and
take
yourself
to
some
positive
time
ahead
of
you
and
you
can
really
see
yourself
now
with
those
increases
in
muscular
size
that
you
have
always
wanted
and
really
notice
how
you
stand
and
notice
how
you
move
and
feel
yourself
looking
and
feeling
exactly
how
you
wish
your
body
to
be
because
feeling
a
great
sense
of
pride
and
pleasure
in
all
of
the
positive
work
that
you
have
done
for
yourself
you
are
now
healthier
and
fitter
stronger
and
happier
in
day-by-day
always
you
are
powerfully
confident
in
your
own
choices
and
abilities
all
of
which
you
exert
easily
in
unison
with
your
own
athletic
physical
body
and
your
deeper
mind
now
aligns
in
perfect
harmony
with
your
physical
body
so
now
ask
once
again
and
simply
allow
that
master
control
within
you
to
permanently
turn
on
all
of
your
natural
recovery
hormones
as
you
feel
all
of
your
natural
growth
hormones
all
the
way
down
to
the
very
deepest
DNA
within
you
feel
into
each
and
every
part
of
you
with
your
best
health
and
improvement
always
in
positive
and
constructive
ways
and
so
you
relax
deeply
if
you
are
drifting
off
to
sleep
at
nighttime
now
or
whenever
you
choose
to
sleep
and
you
can
turn
off
this
recording
here
as
you
allow
yourself
to
drift
and
dream
into
a
deep
sleep
of
absolute
and
total
rest
whereupon
you
will
awake
in
the
morning
feeling
energized
and
refreshed
however
if
you
are
needing
to
get
up
and
continue
on
with
your
day
or
evening
then
just
keep
listening
and
so
in
a
moment
I
'm
going
to
count
upwards
from
one
to
five
and
when
I
say
five
you
can
open
your
eyes
once
again
and
return
back
to
full
conscious
waking
reality
feeling
refreshed
and
revitalized
as
if
you
have
had
the
most
wonderful
nap
or
sleep
so
now
one
easily
and
gently
returning
towards
awareness
and
to
each
muscle
and
nerve
in
your
body
is
loose
and
relaxed
and
three
from
head
to
toe
you
're
feeling
perfect
in
every
way
for
your
eyes
begin
to
feel
sparkling
clear
as
if
they
have
been
bathed
in
fresh
cool
natural
spring
water
and
on
the
next
number
I
say
you
can
open
your
eyes
fully
feeling
alert
and
relaxed
and
positive
and
wonderful
in
each
and
every
way
and
our
five
eyelids
wide
open
fully
aware
taking
in
a
good
deep
breath
and
allowing
yourself
to
stretch
and
fill
your
lungs
with
positive
healthy
energy
and
now
reorient
yourself
fully
to
the
here
and
now
taking
with
you
all
of
the
powerful
work
you
have
just
done
and

your
improved
rest
and
recovery

of
your

you
can
do
this
technique
whenever
you
feel
like
you
have
too
many
thoughts
in
your
headWelcome
.
Go
ahead
and
settle
yourself
into
a
nice
and
comfortable
position
.
Sitting
calmly
and
peacefully
.
Your
posture
relaxed
yet
alert
.
Rest
your
hands
in
your
lap
.
And
gently
close
your
eyes
.
Now
,
let
’
s
take
a
couple
of
deep
,
soothing
breaths
.
Breathing
in
through
the
nose
and
breathing
out
through
the
mouth
.
Breathing
in
and
breathing
out
.
One
last
time
,
breathing
in
,
and
breathing
out
.
Now
,
allow
the
breath
to
settle
.
And
just
bring
your
awareness
to
yourself
.
Be
mindful
of
your
current
emotional
state
.
Accept
yourself
as
you
are
,
right
now
,
in
this
moment
.
And
just
stay
here
for
a
moment
,
enjoying
sitting
with
yourself
.
And
think
about
the
person
you
are
today
and
place
this
current
self
in
context
with
all
the
experiences
that
have
brought
you
here
.
So
maybe
you
are
a
kind
person
.
Think
about
what
has
inﬂuenced
you
toward
being
a
kind
person
?
Maybe
you
are
compassionate
,
loving
,
or
courageous
.
And
just
reﬂect
on
what
has
inﬂuenced
you
toward
being
the
person
that
you
are
today
.
And
bring
to
mind
your
key
traits
and
characteristics
.
What
makes
you
the
person
that
you
are
?
Is
it
your
job
?
Your
skills
and
talents
?
Your
relationships
?
Your
approach
to
life
and
your
hobbies
?
Think
about
the
words
you
would
use
to
deﬁne
yourself
.
So
just
spend
a
few
moments
getting
to
know
yourself
.
And
now
,
recall
a
time
in
your
past
when
you
were
going
through
a
difﬁcult
transition
or
making
a
tough
choice
.
Think
about
what
you
were
doing
and
how
you
were
feeling
at
the
time
.
Remember
how
tough
it
was
to
be
in
that
situation
and
attend
to
your
past
self
with
compassion
and
understanding
.
And
remember
what
it
felt
like
to
pull
through
.
Think
about
how
you
handled
the
situation
or
made
the
difﬁcult
decision
.
Think
about
the
growth
you
experienced
.
Congratulate
yourself
for
going
through
something
that
was
a
challenging
time
.
And
just
take
a
moment
to
wrap
yourself
in
gratitude
and
acceptance
for
all
the
hardships
you
have
been
through
.
To
heal
and
to
grow
is
to
accept
hurting
as
part
of
being
human
.
And
now
,
repeat
the
following
phrases
to
yourself
,
‘
’
I
am
doing
the
best
I
can
with
what
I
have
.
Sometimes
I
struggle
and
that
’
s
okay
.
I
will
be
kind
to
myself
.
I
will
be
patient
with
myself.
’
’
Tell
yourself
that
life
is
hard
sometimes
,
but
you
are
always
here
for
yourself
.
Every
challenge
in
life
creates
an
opportunity
for
growth
.
Take
a
moment
to
appreciate
your
journey
.
And
as
this
practice
comes
to
an
end
,
take
your
time
to
come
back
to
your
surroundings
.
Feeling
the
inner
smile
within
your
body
.
Begin
to
stretch
easily
.
Wiggle
your
toes
and
your
ﬁngers
.
And
when
you
are
ready
,
open
your
eyes
.
begin
by
sitting
in
a
comfortable
position
palms
in
your
lap
facing
open
lovingly
close
your
eyes
and
turn
your
awareness
inwards
towards
your
breath
let
your
belly
expand
as
you
breathe
in
and
contract
as
you
breathe
out
letting
it
feel
natural
fluid
effortless
as
you
feel
yourself
dropping
into
your
body
you
become
more
aware
of
this
present
moment
you
begin
to
give
yourself
the
gift
of
peace
that
comes
from
being
in
the
present
moment
if
throughout
the
course
of
this
practice
you
find
your
mind
wandering
that
's
okay
be
gentle
on
yourself
if
that
happens
just
return
to
your
breath
your
body
and
the
words
you
are
hearing

is
nothing

to
do

let
your
imagination
set
you
free
take
a
deep
breath
in
stomach
and
rib
cage
fully
expanding
holding
your
breath
when
you
reach
the
top
and
as
it
feels
good
to
you
exhale
with
a
sigh
and
begin
to
roll
your
shoulders
wiggle
your
fingers
and
your
toes
perhaps
stretch
your
neck
a
little
side
to
side
and
when
you
feel
ready
take
your
time
as
you
open
your
eyes
back
to
the
world
around
you
recognizing
any
limitations
you
perceive
are
just
that
a
perception
and
nothing
more
[
Music

you
are
incredible
thank
you
so
much
for
being
here
[
Music

youwelcome
to
this
guided
meditation
make
yourself
comfortable
sitting
or
lying
down
with
your
eyes
closed
and
your
hands
apart
to
create
a
meditative
mindset
to
work
on
your
goals
is
easy
by
simply
bringing
your
attention
inside
and
slowing
a
bit
down
you
create
a
sense
of
relaxation
and
space
inside
and
you
can
use
this
inner
space
to
meditate
on
those
goals
that
you
choose
to
work
on
today
[
Music
]
so
now
slowly
take
a
deeper
breath
in
through
your
nose
hold
it
for
a
few
seconds
if
you
'd
like
to
and
exhale
very
slowly
through
the
mouth
and
relax
let
go
[
Music
]
relax
[
Music
]
very
good
now
as
you
pay
attention
inside
breathing
softly
and
comfortably
[
Music
]
you
can
follow
my
guidance
smile
inside
and
enjoy
the
rest
of
your
meditation
[
Music
]
and
as
you
become
centered
by
noticing
the
continuous
steady
flow
of
your
breathing
you
can
recall
for
a
moment
the
most
important
benefits
for
you
of
doing
your
exercise
that
you
're
about
to
start
with
the
big
picture
in
mind
as
well
[
Music
]
that
's
right
[
Music
]
now
as
you
enjoy
this
state
of
inner
awareness
you
can
gently
bring
your
attention
to
those
muscles
that
you
're
going
to
use
mainly
[
Music
]
notice
how
you
can
feel
the
aliveness
in
those
muscles
[
Music
]
you
can
take
a
deeper
breath
in
slowly
slightly
tensing
the
muscles
of
your
arms
or
legs
if
you
'd
like
to
to
get
in
tune
even
more
with
the
life
and
energy
in
your
body
and
when
you
exhale
just
relax
those
[
Music
]
muscles
[
Music
]
[
Music
]
so
that
's
right
[
Music
]
and
as
you
are
becoming
more
grounded
in
your
body
you
may
feel
more
eager
to
experience
the
various
pleasures
of
using
your
body
strengthening
your
muscles
exploring
the
potentials
of
this
amazing
machine
that
the
human
body
is
and
as
you
've
become
more
in
tune
with
your
body
like
this
you
're
going
to
be
more
focused
and
centered
you
become
more
mindful
of
the
joys
and
benefits
of
nurturing
and
strengthening
your
body
[
Music
]
you
can
remember
what
socrates
said
no
man
has
the
right
to
be
an
amateur
in
the
matter
of
physical
training
it
is
a
shame
for
a
man
to
grow
old
without
seeing
the
beauty
and
strength
of
which
his
body
is
[
Music
]
capable
[
Music
]
so
take
this
mindset
of
focus
commitment
and
eagerness
with
you
go
train
your
body
to
experience
the
beauty
and
strength
it
's
capable
of
enjoy
your
exercise
[
Music

have
a
pleasant
feeling
of
contentment
about
all
the
things
you
've
experienced

some
deeper

in
to
breathe
in
more
energy
feeling
fresher

you
can
think
about
the
room
around
you
and
what
you
will
do
next

is
essential
so
many
times
in
this

we
are
told
to
ask
for
more

for
more

more
but
truthfully
we
have
all
that
we
need
within
ourselves
breathe
deeply
and
be
here
with
this
idea
take
a
moment
now
to
think
of
anything
that
has
made
you
smile
recently
it
could
be
a
meal
a
funny
joke
that
brightened
your
day
or
even
a
smile
from
a
stranger
take
note
of
how
this
thought
feels
in
your

of
your
head
all
the
way
down

and
your

out
to
all
that
surrounds
you
to
your
community
to
the
world
gratitude
is
like
a
seed
it
needs
water
and
care
and
when
we
practice
gratitude
frequently
we
water
the
seed
we
bloom
come
back
to
your
body
now
connecting
again
with
the
gentle
rise
and
fall
of
your
chest
feeling
the
air
entering
your
lungs
and
exiting
your
body
feeling
where
your
body
is
in
space

it
all
in

the
meadow
before
you
is
full
of
soft
tall
grasses
rich
in
light
greens

be
a
subtle
flicker
in
the
distant
sky
a
soft
flash
of
light
it
's
not
alarming
at
all
but
it
invites
your
attention
you
notice
a
flicker
of
a
faint
image
it
's
an
image
from
your
recent
past
[
Music

there
are
multiple
images
and
they
seem
to
be
representing
an
area
of
your
life
where
you
desire
to
change
something
is
telling
you
that
you
do
not
need
to
dwell
on
these
images

scenes
are
only
reminders
that
these
are
moments
of
your
past

where

moment

of
judgment
of
what

is
the
moment
you
begin
to
move
forward
and
act
as
the
architect
of
your
upcoming
experiences

you
begin
to
step
forward
into
the
grassy
meadow
[

In
today
’
s
meditation
,
we
will
be
exploring
the
power
of
vulnerability
,
opening
the
heart
lovingly
to
both
ourselves
and
to
this
innate
human
quality
.
To
begin
,
bring
yourself
to
a
seated
position
that
is
secure
and
comfortable
.
Close
the
eyes
and
allow
the
muscles
around
them
to
soften…
…
and
then
check
in
with
your
posture
.
Ensure
that
the
neck
and
the
rest
of
the
spine
form
one
straight
line
,
and
then
allow
the
shoulders
to
relax
.
Soften
the
stomach
as
you
become
more
attuned
to
your
breath
,
allowing
it
to
flow
as
deep
as
is
comfortable
for
you
in
this
moment
.
Now
,
take
a
moment
to
tune
into
any
thoughts
or
stories
that
may
be
trickling
through
the
mind
.
They
may
be
strong
,
heavy
,
and
stubborn…
…
or
they
may
be
soft
,
gentle
,
and
fleeting
.
Whatever
the
mind
’
s
contents
feel
like
in
this
moment
,
see
if
you
can
open
your
heart
lovingly
to
whatever
is
here…
…
and
then
soften
as
you
return
to
your
direct
felt
experience
in
this
moment
.
Notice
the
earth
beneath
you
or
the
surface
supporting
you…
and
notice
any
physical
sensations
that
may
be
present
within
.
If
anything
uncomfortable
is
present
,
invite
a
loving
,
compassionate
breath
into
each
of
these
areas
.
Take
a
few
more
moments
of
quiet
space
now
,
just
witnessing
whatever
is
here
as
you
continually
re-ground
yourself
through
the
breath
.
What
does
it
mean
to
be
vulnerable
?
To
be
vulnerable
is
to
be
raw
,
honest
,
and
open
;
it
is
to
be
capable
of
loss
,
hurt
,
and
pain
.
It
is
to
be
fully
human
.
Many
of
us
hide
our
vulnerabilities
,
denying
wounds
and
avoiding
failure
,
because
they
hold
much
shame
,
guilt
,
and
judgment
.
In
a
world
that
often
fails
to
go
deep
(
or
fears
doing
so
)
,
vulnerabilities
are
seen
as
weakness
–
and
weakness
is
seen
as
something
negative
.
However
,
if
we
open
ourselves
to
the
possibility
of
being
truly
vulnerable
,
we
come
into
contact
with
its
power
.
Because
,
despite
any
misconceptions
we
might
hold
about
it
,
vulnerability
is
where
our
humanity
shines
through
;
and
through
it
,
we
grow
,
evolve
,
and
find
strength
.
In
the
words
of
Brené
Brown
,
“
Vulnerability
is
the
birthplace
of
innovation
,
creativity
,
and
change.
”
When
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
vulnerable
,
we
learn
more
about
who
we
are
as
individuals
and
as
humans
;
understandings
that
propel
us
forward
for
positive
growth
.
Brown
also
explains
,
“
Embracing
our
vulnerabilities
is
risky
but
not
nearly
as
dangerous
as
giving
up
on
love
and
belonging
and
joy
–
the
experiences
that
make
us
the
most
vulnerable.
”
Her
words
are
an
invitation
for
us
to
honour
and
acknowledge
our
vulnerabilities
.
As
each
of
us
is
human
,
each
of
us
is
vulnerable
in
a
variety
of
ways
.
As
we
open
ourselves
up
honestly
and
authentically
with
healthy
boundaries
in
place
,
we
deepen
our
understanding
of
ourselves
and
our
connection
to
others
.
And
,
as
we
practice
this
authentic
opening
,
we
invite
others
to
do
the
same
with
us
.
Let
’
s
explore
this
a
little
further
,
diving
into
the
inner
world
:
Take
a
moment
to
tune
in
once
again
with
your
posture
,
opening
your
heart
space
to
be
witnessed
,
nurtured
,
and
respected
.
And
then
take
a
moment
to
consider
what
vulnerability
means
to
you
–
and
to
reflect
mindfully
upon
what
makes
you
vulnerable
.
If
fear-based
thoughts
arise
during
this
inquiry
,
see
if
you
might
speak
compassionately
towards
them
,
reminding
them
that
you
are
in
a
safe
space
to
explore
what
rests
within
.
To
love
is
to
be
vulnerable
.
To
create
is
to
be
vulnerable
.
To
take
leaps
of
faith
is
to
be
vulnerable
.
Allow
this
inquiry
to
expand
and
deepen
.
And
now
,
returning
your
attention
to
the
center
of
your
chest
–
perhaps
resting
a
palm
or
two
on
top
of
your
heart
–
silently
repeat
the
following
words
:
I
am
authentic
,
honest
,
and
true
.
I
am
willing
to
be
all
of
who
I
am
.
Vulnerability
fuels
compassion
,
creativity
,
and
growth
.
Take
a
moment
now
to
thank
yourself
for
showing
up
for
this
courageous
practice
.
And
then
,
draw
your
attention
to
your
breath
for
another
cycle
or
two
.
Notice
the
breath
’
s
innate
ebb
and
flow
.
Draw
your
attention
to
the
earth
beneath
you…
and
to
any
sounds
around
you
.
And
when
you
are
ready
,
gently
open
your
eyes
.
I
hope
you
enjoyed
today
’
s
session
.
See
you
again
.

hello
and
welcome
to
day
10
of
the
expand
meditation
program
today
is
a
wonderful
day
not
only
because
it
's
the
last
day
of
the
program
and
you
made
it
through
the
entire
program
so
far
but
it
's
also
the
beginning
and
continuation
of
your
own
meditation
journey
maybe
you
have
found
those
last
10
days
really
hard
and
it
was
very
hard
for
you
to
sit
down
find
time
to
practice
or
maybe
you
found
it
very
easy
and
it
felt
all
really
good
for
you
no
matter
how
the
experience
was
know
that
there
is
no
bad
meditation
so
you
showed
up
for
yourself
and
you
did
the
work
which
is
all
that
counts
usually
we
have
a
next
steps
video
at
the
end
of
every
single
one
of
our
programs
but
this
can
all
be
summarized
in
today
's
video
and
of
course
the
message
that
we
want
to
send
to
you
is
to
keep
going
keep
showing
up
really
just
don't
stop
every
single
day
is
a
new
opportunity
to
connect
to
yourself
to
learn
more
about
yourself
to
connect
to
stillness
within
and
you
do
that
through
your
meditation
practice
so
although
the
program
ends
today
we
highly
encourage
you
that
you
continue
again
tomorrow
with
day
one
and
just
keep
repeating
the
program
we
strongly
encourage
you
to
follow
the
program
and
go
through
it
for
at
least
30
days
so
two
or
three
times
more
through
the
full
program
so
that
you
really
have
established
a
solid
habit
and
something
that
you
can
rely
on
in
the
flow
of
life
you
can
always
come
back
to
this
practice
it
will
help
you
ground
it
will
help
you
lift
you
up
no
matter
what
life
is
throwing
at
you
you
always
have
your
practice
to
come
back
to
to
reconnect
only
because
your
experience
of
this
program
was
a
certain
way
for
the
last
10
days
does
n't
mean
that
it
has
to
continue
like
this
for
the
next
10
days
or
for
the
next
whatever
how
many
days
it
could
be
that
the
experience
was
so
far
challenging
and
the
next
10
days
will
be
super
easy
and
smooth
and
you
feel
incredibly
good
it
could
also
be
that
you
felt
really
good
throughout
the
last
10
days
the
next
10
days
will
be
very
challenging
know
that
this
is
completely
normal
that
the
meditation
progress
is
not
really
linear
it
comes
in
different
stages
and
there
's
ups
and
downs
and
the
important
part
is
to
not
compare
your
meditation
practice
and
experience
as
it
is
today
to
something
that
was
a
while
ago
sometimes
even
when
you
're
meditating
for
many
years
it
could
be
that
at
a
certain
time
in
a
certain
stage
it
feels
like
you
just
started
out
again
and
you
feel
like
the
meditations
that
you
did
several
years
ago
but
know
that
this
is
all
part
of
the
growth
and
part
of
the
process
so
the
reminder
here
to
just
trust
the
process
keep
showing
up
and
treat
every
meditation
independently
enjoy
every
meditation
as
it
is
and
as
it
unfolds
each
day
when
you
are
ready
to
begin
grab
your
pillow
set
everything
up
find
a
comfortable
seat
take
a
few
deep
breaths
and
whenever
you
're
ready
close
your
eyes
take
the
next
few
breaths
or
so
to
connect
to
your
body
notice
what
you
're
sitting
on
the
connection
and
support
to
and
from
the
earth
from
there
lengthen
upwards
through
the
spine
in
the
beginning
of
your
meditation
when
you
just
sat
down
it
's
the
time
to
readjust
to
move
around
so
that
you
can
sit
effortlessly
throughout
this
practice
this
helps
to
set
you
up
right
in
the
beginning
so
that
you
can
be
as
still
as
possible
throughout
your
session
establish
that
connection
to
your
breath
that
is
it
has
become
so
familiar
now
over
the
last
10
days
because
you
continue
to
show
up
every
day
to
sit
down
and
feel
the
breath
feel
yourself
feel
the
life
force
that
is
included
in
the
air
you
take
in
that
keeps
all
the
systems
going
that
keeps
you
going
as
well
as
the
plants
and
animals
and
all
the
other
earthlings
on
this
beautiful
planet
we
all
breathe
the
same
air
you
all
see
the
same
sun
the
same
moon
feel
the
same
rain
mother
nature
is
ultimately
what
connects
us
all
that
connects
all
beings
that
means
reconnecting
to
mother
nature
is
reconnecting
to
everything
it
's
reconnecting
to
life
reconnecting
to
yourself
each
and
every
day
as
you
sit
down
perhaps
for
the
rest
of
your
life
by
really
making
your
meditation
practice
a
really
solid
part
of
your
day
it
is
through
that
that
you
discover
more
about
yourself
you
discover
more
about
everything
and
everyone
around
you
and
you
can
bring
more
quality
into
all
the
actions
you
do
throughout
the
day
continue
to
lean
back
into
that
pure
awareness
where
you
observe
the
breath
if
distractions
come
up
let
them
be
and
let
them
go
treat
yourself
with
kindness
that
you
noticed
and
refocus
on
the
breath
there
are
three
qualities
of
awakened
doing
with
awakening
being
the
realization
that
you
are
not
your
thoughts
but
instead
your
being
your
true
self
is
separate
from
the
thoughts
it
is
which
has
the
ability
to
observe
the
thoughts
those
three
doings
are
acceptance
which
is
you
being
fully
present
surrendering
and
accepting
to
what
is
it
might
seem
like
a
passive
action
or
you
being
passive
but
it
's
not
to
be
confused
with
not
caring
it
is
actively
choosing
to
be
okay
with
something
that
's
currently
going
on
although
your
first
instinct
or
reaction
or
from
the
outside
it
seems
like
not
such
a
good
thing
whatever
is
coming
your
way
in
life
through
presence
you
accept
you
're
accepting
life
the
second
awaken
doing
is
enjoyment
enjoyment
is
not
something
inward
flowing
towards
you
it
's
not
something
found
in
the
activities
or
in
the
doing
or
in
the
work
or
in
your
surrounding
it
's
from
the
deep
connection
to
yourself
within
that
you
feel
this
enjoyment
and
let
it
grow
so
that
it
then
is
outward
flowing
from
within
outwards
into
whatever
you
're
doing
the
doing
itself
is
the
purpose
of
the
doing
not
to
reach
any
goal
or
anything
you're
working
towards
that
is
helpful
but
secondary
the
act
of
doing
right
now
is
all
that
counts
the
third
modality
of
awakened
doing
is
enthusiasm
it
is
you
finding
joy
and
fulfillment
in
your
actions
so
much
so
that
you
are
just
really
excited
about
it
all
your
enthusiasm
is
so
strong
that
you
can
not
wait
to
do
more
of
what
you
're
doing
because
you
enjoy
doing
it
if
you
recognize
any
of
these
three
in
your
life
then
the
awakening
process
has
already
started
where
you
go
deeper
and
deeper
to
yourself
to
life
to
nature
at
this
point
you
can
not
stop
the
process
anymore
you
can
only
delay
it
and
by
establishing
a
meditation
practice
daily
you
can
cultivate
those
qualities
let
them
grow
go
deeper
the
plant
has
already
started
to
grow
maybe
you
see
a
little
bit
of
it
already
maybe
not
if
you
continue
to
show
up
to
meditate
to
breathe
to
be
you
are
watering
that
plant
as
you
continue
your
meditation
practice
over
the
next
days
weeks
months
and
years
imagine
how
much
this
can
transform
you
imagine
how
much
this
can
transform
your
life
your
relationships
your
work
all
this
enjoyment
and
all
this
quality
outward
flowing
into
everything
else
around
you
but
coming
from
deep
within
it's
important
to
reconnect
to
that
source
within
as
often
as
possible
maybe
someday
you
do
n't
have
to
reconnect
anymore
because
you
are
constantly
in
this
state
of
connection
this
is
the
true
liberation
also
called
moksha
but
it
's
all
about
feeling
it
within
you
feel
it
a
little
bit
within
yourself
you
felt
that
spark
the
process
has
started
continue
to
show
up
day
after
day
to
water
the
plants
let
it
grow
and
enjoy
enjoy
what
is
unfolding
notice
the
air
coming
in
through
the
nose
and
out
to
the
nose
the
breath
is
always
with
you
there
are
many
opportunities
for
you
throughout
the
day
to
feel
it
to
reconnect
to
take
a
few
minutes
of
breathing
in
and
out
nice
and
slow
there
is
no
upper
limit
to
how
many
times
you
can
reconnect
throughout
the
day
in
addition
to
your
daily
meditation
practice
if
you
're
waiting
in
line
if
you're
waiting
for
the
train
or
for
your
taxi
consider
just
sitting
down
or
standing
eyes
open
or
closed
and
breathe
just
for
a
minute
maybe
for
five
it
's
about
this
reconnection
several
times
throughout
the
day
which
will
really
rewire
your
brain
and
create
stronger
connections
of
love
peace
relaxation
presence
and
authenticity
the
journey
has
just
begun
you
know
the
door
and
it
's
up
to
you
to
go
through
it
to
continue
this
practice
the
path
will
appear
as
you
walk
it
day
after
day
step
by
step
feel
the
connection
to
the
earth
again
length
now
to
the
spine
when
you
feel
ready
bring
your
palms
together
bring
the
hands
to
the
heart
to
be
so
so
proud
of
yourself
for
showing
up
over
the
last
10
days
sitting
down
to
practice
to
reconnect
that
space
within
you
has
always
been
there
but
it
's
sometimes
covered
up
this
is
why
we
come
back
to
the
practice
to
sit
reconnect
to
who
you
truly
are
from
here
on
it
's
up
to
you
what
you
make
of
this
journey
but
you
are
worth
it
to
go
deep
to
feel
the
love
for
yourself
for
others
to
be
happy
to
be
at
ease
i
wish
you
the
best
of
luck
love
and
support
on
your
journey
thank
you
very
much
for
practicing
with
us
today
with
love
and
gratitude

English
hello
and
welcome
to
inspired
meditations
this
guided
meditation
is
called
embrace
a
growth
and
success
mindset
95
%
of
our
thoughts
are
repetitive
if
that
's
any
indication
of
how
we
live
our
lives
we
repeat
a
lot
day
in
and
day
out
the
problem
with
this
is
we
begin
to
settle
into
a
groove
without
growth
and
to
be
successful
to
achieve
your
goals
you
need
to
do
something
you
have
n't
done
before
and
think
in
a
way
you
have
n't
thought
before
most
people
remain
stuck
in
the
same
old
patterns
and
limited
beliefs
and
thoughts
rendering
them
the
same
old
results
and
lack
of
growth
their
goals
have
changed
but
their
mindset
has
not
and
they
repeat
the
same
day
even
a
tree
planted
firmly
in
the
ground
finds
a
way
to
grow
it
grows
up
and
toward
the
sky
your
thoughts
and
beliefs
impact
your
reality
if
you
're
currently
operating
on
a
fixed
mindset
old
thoughts
or
you've
hit
too
many
dead
ends
you
may
think
is
is
it
or
be
convinced
this
is
it
please
give
this
guy
to
meditation
to
listen
do
n't
settle
for
what
you
already
have
and
nothing
more
when
you
are
desiring
so
much
more
are
n't
you
the
least
bit
curious
about
what
you
are
capable
of
new
growth
and
successful
thought
patterns
are
something
you
can
achieve
with
this
guided
meditation
if
you
are
ready
and
I
believe
you
are
let
's
begin
settle
yourself
into
your
seat
like
you
've
never
settled
before
go
ahead
let
loose
what
have
you
got
to
lose
give
yourself
permission
to
relax
you
can
say
to
yourself
permission
to
relax
permission
granted
permission
to
slump
over
restfully
like
a
sleeping
dog
or
napping
cat
you
will
be
relaxing
and
learning
here
and
relaxing
while
you
learn
learning
things
for
your
benefit
your
growth
your
personal
success
just
get
really
nice
and
comfortable
committed
to
this
process
you
are
preparing
to
alter
or
enhance
your
current
mindset
in
your
favor
instead
of
forcing
it
like
you
may
be
accustomed
to
by
willpower
or
waiting
on
motivation
you
will
settle
into
it
easily
naturally
and
almost
effortlessly
like
easing
into
relaxation
now
no
need
to
force
it
relaxation
happens
differently
for
everyone
often
the
mind
or
the
body
resists
pulling
back
just
a
little
or
a
lot
this
resisting
is
a
silly
habit
you
can
feel
free
to
let
go
of
at
any
time
because
what
you
really
crave
his
deep
relaxation
whether
you
resist
with
a
tense
body
or
busy
mind
let
me
assure
you
it
is
natural
it
's
better
to
release
the
urge
to
control
the
resisting
than
to
push
back
do
not
resist
the
resisting
let
it
go
let
nature
take
his
course
and
let
relaxation
find
your
body
ultimately
either
your
mind
or
your
body
will
release
it
first
releasing
the
effort
it
takes
just
to
relax
instead
it
will
resist
the
effort
it
takes
to
resist
and
simply
give
in
to
the
feeling
of
complete
and
comfortable
relaxation
the
kind
of
relaxation
that
soothes
your
mind
and
your
body
you
may
be
wondering
how
much
easier
would
be
to
just
relax
nestled
in
your
protective
corner
of
your
mind
wherever
relaxation
occurs
for
you
loosen
up
your
neck
and
shoulders
wiggle
or
slouch
into
your
seat
[
Music

now
is
a
good
time
to
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
exhale
releasing
tension
release
whatever
it
is
you
're
holding
on
to
feel
yourself
relax
deeper
on
the
exhales
another
nice
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
and
exhale
releasing
relaxing
deeper
into
relaxation
settling
deeper
into
your
seat
checking
whether
your
mind
or
your
body
feels
more
relaxed
right
now
is
your
mind
settling
into
the
background
or
your
body
releasing
tightness
whichever
it
is
see
if
you
can
notice
it
now
and
make
a
mental
note
of
it
body
relaxed
mind
relaxed
any
and
all
relaxation
is
progress
as
you
achieve
a
state
of
peace
[

take
one
more
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
really
enjoying
the
process
like
a
vacation
and
exhale
let
the
tension
deflate
out
of
your
shoulders
your
back
your
hips
all
the
way
down
to
your
legs
relaxation
cascading
down
through
your
entire
body
washing
over
you
soothing
and
effortless
your
breathing
becomes
regular
and
easy
finding
a
natural
rhythm
for
you
gently
closing
your
eyes
if
you
have
n't
already
quieting
the
mind
pleasantly
distracted
with
a
simple
game
of
counting
backwards
starting
with
100
down
to
99
imagine
the
numbers
in
your
mind
as
you
count
down
98
97
96
down
to
90
watching
the
numbers
go
down
drifting
down
into
deep
relaxation
still
counting
[
Music
]
down
further
still
counting
your
way
backwards
and
to
relaxation
and
soon
you
spend
less
effort
on
counting
and
simply
watch
the
numbers
drift
on
and
on
and
you
can
lose
track
of
them
if
you
like
now
at
this
point
accomplishing
just
the
right
amount
of
relaxation
for
you
releasing
the
numbers
let
go
of
any
efforts
now
while
you
take
this
time
to
relax
and
learn
in
a
special
way
for
your
growth
your
personal
success
and
to
see
farther
beyond
what
you
have
ever
seen
before
listen
carefully
and
diligently
now
that
you
are
relaxed
in
your
own
way
I
can
let
you
into
a
sacred
space
of
growth
one
that
will
contribute
to
your
personal
success
you
can
almost
feel
it
now
relaxed
in
mind
and
body
you
can
let
these
learnings
soak
into
you
flow
into
your
inner
knowing
listen
now
to
this
universal
truth
people
grow
evidence
shows
all
people
can
purposely
change
and
grow
throughout
their
lifetime
leading
to
positive
effects
both
physically
and
mentally
you
can
grow
the
hand
you
were
dealt
is
just
a
starting
point
for
development
I
wonder
if
you
know
you
can
grow
through
mistakes
and
setbacks
too
that
's
called
learning
and
the
more
you
learn
the
more
you
can
do
and
the
more
knowledge
you
take
with
you
to
apply
to
your
future
success
you
can
grow
because
you
recognize
your
accomplishments
maybe
some
you
haven't
noticed
before
you
grow
because
you
feel
moved
by
possibilities
ignoring
what
you
think
is
impossible
you
can
say
I'm
exploring
this
and
just
trying
things
out
you
have
a
GPS
navigation
pointing
you
towards
something
good
at
all
times
like
an
inner
compass
you
can
now
see
golden
opportunities
thanks
to
your
focused
growth
mindset
that
you
continually
develop
and
expand
unexpected
events
and
happenstance
leads
to
new
opportunities
you
now
recognize
those
opportunities
considering
changes
you
've
always
wanted
to
make
they
show
up
as
a
reality
in
your
mind
now
the
seed
is
planted
for
things
to
be
set
in
motion
learning
from
your
difficulties
every
success
story
is
sprinkled
with
difficulties
learning
in
this
meditation
so
that
you
can
apply
it
to
your
life
learning
from
the
process
of
growth
in
order
to
grow
your
personal
success
discovering
and
focusing
on
your
definition
of
success
regardless
of
external
influences
learn
and
never
forget
or
take
for
granted
the
lessons
they
are
valuable
beyond
measurement
this
is
your
recipe
for
growth
and
now
I
want
you
to
see
what
growth
looks
like
open
your
mind
up
to
your
imagination
I
want
you
to
see
growth
to
see
it
presented
to
you
through
five
doors
just
ahead
of
you
imagine
what
those
five
doors
look
like
you
scope
them
out
before
approaching
perhaps
they
are
monotone
and
unassuming
or
colorful
and
eye-catching
are
they
made
of
wood
or
metal
or
any
other
door
material
notice
all
these
doors
appear
to
be
closed
from
a
distance
but
as
you
come
closer
step
by
step
you
experience
an
open
minded
attitude
open
to
possibilities
open
to
good
changes
open
to
learning
a
special
invitation
awaits
you
from
behind
each
door
you
ask
yourself
which
of
these
doors
looks
the
most
open
to
me
what
more
do
I
want
to
experience
open
any
door
and
investigate
any
number
of
opportunities
waiting
for
you
keep
this
in
mind

have
infinite
possibilities
for
growth
in
your
life
you
have
infinite
ways
of
achieving
your
personal
definition
of
success
you
may
not
continue
to
seek
out
what
every
door
offers
you
develop
the
knowing
and
intuition
to
leave
a
door
behind

it
no
longer
serves
you

begin
by
sitting
in
a
comfortable
position
whatever
that
looks
like
for
you
lovingly
close
your
eyes
and
tune
in
to
your
breath
and
your
body
taking
a
moment
to
really
pause
here
and
focus
on
your
breath
letting
your
belly
expand
as
you
breathe
in
followed
by
your
ribcage
and
contract
as
you
breathe
out
let
yourself
deepen
your
awareness
of
your
breath
and
body
[

feel
the
weight
of
gravity
[

and
let
yourself
be
here
right
now
begin
to
feel
genuine
appreciation
and
thankfulness
to
yourself
as
you
feel
yourself
becoming
more
present
and
relax
into
that
presence
let
it
be
natural
and
simple
it
simply
is
just
as
you
simply
are
and
as
you
feel
your
body
relax
[
Music
]
we
are
transported
to
a
tropical
beach
there
are
palm
trees
rustling
in
the
wind
and
smooth
clear
steady
water
you
can
see
through
it
perfectly
all
the
way
to
the
sand
at
the
bottom
and
it
's
as
if
the
weight
of
gravity
keeps
you
anchored
down
as
you
walk
on
the
soft
sand
into
the
water
submersing
yourself
fully
[
Music

feeling
the
flow
of
the
water
around
your
body
encompassing
you
in
a
loving
sensation
as
you
walk
further
down
surrounded
by
love
[
Music
]
until
you
reach
a
pausing
point
where
you
find
a
treasure
chest
glowing
at
the
depths
of
the
water
you
effortlessly
walk
up
to
it
with
a
sense
of
awe
and
wonder
there
's
a
question
mark
on
the
top
of
the
box
notice
what
question
you
have
within
you
right
now
trust
that
question
and
say
thank
you
to
it
and
now
open
the
box
and
find
your
answer
inside
it
emerges
as
something
symbolic
to
you
right
now
allow
yourself
to
receive
the
answer
fully
and
say
thank
you
trusting
your
imagination
and
intuition
trusting
yourself
with
this
box
now
clear
with
the
exception
of
a
thin
film
of
gold
sparkling
and
glittering
inside
of
it
you
allow
yourself
to
enter
this
treasure
box
making
it
as
comfortable
as
you
'd
like
if
this
means
you
need
to
make
it
as
big
as
a
house
go
ahead
and
do
so
[

now
that
you
are
inside
the
treasure
box
[

with
the
gold
glittering
all
around
you
[

allow
yourself
to
breathe
in
the
glittering
gold
energy
receiving
it
into
your
cells
into
your

it
all
around

﻿A
Guided
Meditation
on
the
Body
,
Space
&
Awareness
Yongey
Mingyur
Rinpoche
Welcome
!
I
’
m
very
happy
to
share
with
you
some
meditation
instructions
.
It
is
very
simple
:
Please
keep
your
spine
straight
.
Just
straight
,
but
do
n't
worry
too
much
about
perfection
.
I
have
to
stay
there
,
perfectly
!
Just
keep
straight
.
And
please
close
your
eyes
.
Just
close
your
eyes
like
you
’
re
sleeping
.
You
don
’
t
have
to
close
them
too
tightly
,
or
in
any
special
way
.
And
relax
your
muscles
in
your
body
.
Relax
the
muscles
in
your
head
,
forehead
,
face
,
ears
,
cheeks
,
throat
,
upper
body
,
arms
and
hands
,
lower
body
,
legs
and
feet
.
Just
totally
relax
,
yet
with
your
spine
straight
.
And
bend
your
neck
forward
a
little
bit
.
It
's
almost
like
the
weight
of
your
head
rests
on
your
neck
.
You
can
effortlessly
rest
.
Each
part
of
the
body
rests
on
the
one
below
.
And
in
this
way
,
you
feel
like
you
’
re
resting
but
there
’
s
also
some
strength
,
so
you
can
find
balance
.
All
the
parts
of
your
body
are
resting
,
one
on
top
of
the
other
.
But
,
at
the
same
time
,
there
’
s
a
strength
within
you
.
Your
spine
is
straight
.
Sometimes
you
feel
a
little
bit
of
gravity
.
And
sometimes
you
feel
some
sensations
.
Just
let
it
be
.
Whatever
feeling
is
in
your
body
,
just
be
aware
and
let
it
be
.
When
I
was
young
,
my
father
used
to
tell
me
,
''
Let
your
body
be
on
the
cushion
,
and
let
your
mind
be
in
the
body
.
''
This
way
,
you
join
body
and
mind
together
.
Your
mind
comes
into
the
body
.
Just
be
aware
of
your
body
,
and
be
aware
of
any
sensation
or
feelings
in
your
body
.
Pleasant
feelings
,
joy
,
bliss
,
or
unpleasant
feelings
,
tightness
,
pain
,
or
neutral
feelings
,
maybe
tingling
,
or
no
feeling
.
So
,
with
any
type
of
feeling
,
just
be
aware
and
let
it
be
.
OK
,
for
a
few
seconds
,
just
be
aware
and
relaxed
.
OK.
Now
,
you
can
expand
your
awareness
beyond
your
body
,
to
what
surrounds
you
.
Maybe
there
are
some
sounds
,
or
some
smells
,
or
some
sensations
,
like
your
room
temperature
is
a
little
bit
too
hot
or
cold
,
or
some
noise
,
like
people
chatting
,
or
a
car
,
a
train
,
or
airplanes
moving
around
,
or
your
neighbors
making
noise
.
Anything
.
Just
be
aware
.
Just
know
.
Just
recognize
there
are
sounds
.
And
your
awareness
becomes
more
open
,
and
vaster
.
Stay
there
and
be
aware
of
any
phenomena
for
a
few
seconds
.
Now
,
you
can
expand
your
awareness
beyond
your
immediate
surrounding
.
Feel
the
space
around
you
,
above
you
,
and
be
aware
of
that
space
.
Further
,
deeper
.
All
the
phenomena
are
occurring
in
the
space
,
changing
in
the
space
,
dissolving
back
into
the
space
.
Like
clouds
,
they
come
into
the
space
,
remain
in
the
space
,
and
dissolve
into
the
space
.
And
,
now
,
you
can
expand
your
awareness
even
more
.
Go
beyond
the
clouds
,
into
space
,
which
is
boundless
.
Space
,
which
is
open
in
all
directions
,
everywhere
.
Be
there
.
Don
’
t
worry
,
you
’
re
not
going
to
get
lost
.
Stay
there
for
few
seconds
.
OK
,
now
,
please
slowly
open
your
eyes
,
and
be
present
here
.
And
rest
your
mind
,
also
—
not
only
the
body
.
How
do
you
rest
your
mind
?
For
example
:
If
you
like
to
do
physical
exercise
,
like
jogging
in
the
garden
or
park
,
or
hiking
in
the
hills
or
mountains
,
maybe
for
a
few
minutes
or
hours
...
let
’
s
say
one
hour
...
After
you
finish
your
jog
,
you
may
use
a
nice
seat
or
a
rock
,
or
a
grass
field
.
Sit
on
the
grass
field
and
,
with
a
big
sigh
,
“
Ahh
,
”
just
rest
.
You
don
’
t
have
to
meditate
,
just
let
your
mind
rest
as
it
is
and
the
body
,
also
.
Just
rest
...
for
a
few
seconds
.
Maybe
you
feel
like
,
“
Oh
,
there
are
so
many
thoughts
,
so
many
emotions
occurring
in
my
mind
.
What
should
I
do
with
those
emotions
,
those
thoughts
?
”
Same
.
Same
as
before
,
you
just
be
aware
.
If
there
are
thoughts
and
emotions
,
you
’
re
just
aware
of
thoughts
and
emotions
,
what
I
call
“
blah
blah
blah
,
”
just
look
at
the
“
blah
blah
blah
,
”
be
aware
,
and
let
it
be
.
Same
as
when
you
’
re
aware
of
your
body
,
aware
of
sounds
and
sensations
,
now
it
’
s
the
same
:
Just
be
aware
of
thoughts
and
emotions
.
Let
them
come
,
and
let
them
go
.
But
,
if
you
can
not
be
aware
of
them
,
it
’
s
also
fine
.
You
're
in
a
non-conceptual
state
of
mind
,
but
not
too
long
—
only
for
a
few
seconds
.
Again
,
when
you
see
thoughts
and
emotions
,
or
forms
,
sounds
,
smells
—
anything
,
just
be
aware
...
for
a
few
seconds
.
If
anything
occurs
in
your
mind
,
in
your
body
,
in
your
perceptions
,
just
be
aware
,
and
let
it
be
.
OK.
Now
,
you
can
apply
this
awareness
,
this
openness
,
this
awareness
with
any
situation
in
your
life
,
with
any
activities
in
your
daily
life
.
Short
time
,
many
times
,
everywhere
,
anytime
.
Seven
days
a
week
,
365
a
year
.
In
this
way
,
you
can
fill
your
mind
with
joyful
,
peaceful
experiences
,
and
you
will
develop
your
inner
love
,
compassion
,
and
wisdom
.
Thank
you
!

youWelcome
to
our
gentle
and
calm
meditation
for
relaxation
and
sleep
.
In
this
moment
right
now
I
want
you
to
find
a
space
to
externally
and
internally
disconnect
from
the
outside
noise
.
May
we
take
this
opportunity
to
let
go
of
the
day
,
let
go
of
the
idea
if
t
was
good
or
bad
and
simply
fall
into
the
silence
and
peace
within
your
heart
.
So
let
's
find
a
comfortable
seated
position
.
You
can
even
sit
on
your
bed
in
preparation
for
a
deep
and
restful
sleep
.
Take
a
deep
breath
in
and
exhale
out
.
Rest
your
hands
comfortably
on
your
lap
.
Close
your
eyes
.
Notice
how
you
're
feeling
right
now
in
this
moment
.
Inhale
and
exhale
.
Take
this
opportunity
to
let
go
of
the
heaviness
,
the
body
,
the
mind
.
Allow
any
tension
to
release
out
of
your
face
,
relax
your
forehead
.
Allow
your
eyes
to
be
heavy
,
the
jaw
to
be
relaxed
.
Inhale
and
exhale
.
There
is
no
more
need
to
hold
on
to
anything
anymore
.
Give
yourself
the
permission
to
truly
surrender
to
rest
,
to
peace
and
to
the
calm
and
loving
energy
within
you
.
Inhale
and
exhale
.
Let
go
of
your
shoulders
.
Let
them
fall
away
,
downward
,
away
from
your
ears
.
Releasing
any
heaviness
,
weight
and
tension
that
the
world
may
have
brought
upon
you
today
.
Let
it
go
.
Allow
your
arms
to
be
heavy
,
soft
and
relaxed
.
Feel
your
heart
gently
beating
with
each
inhale
and
exhale
,
reminding
you
of
the
powerful
energy
that
exists
within
,
reminding
you
of
this
beautiful
life
that
you
have
,
that
you
get
to
experience
through
all
the
positive
and
challenging
moments
each
serving
a
purpose
,
to
find
gratitude
,
to
find
strength
,
peace
and
acceptance
of
this
magical
existence
on
this
earth
.
Breathe
in
.
Breathe
out
.
With
every
breath
that
you
take
right
now
open
your
heart
to
gratitude
,
to
love
,
to
forgiveness
and
to
this
presence
within
you
.
You
are
strong
,
you
are
powerful
,
you
are
beautiful
.
You
are
loved
and
you
are
love
.
Let
this
idea
sit
with
you
as
you
slowly
give
yourself
permission
to
relax
,
to
let
go
of
the
day
,
the
worries
,
the
uncertainty
,
digging
deeper
within
yourself
to
find
the
true
essence
of
what
and
who
you
are
,
your
loving
conscious
awareness
.
Inhale
and
exhale
.
Notice
your
breath
,
notice
what
comes
to
you
as
you
begin
to
let
go
.
Notice
any
images
,
colors
,
shapes
or
memories
that
may
arise
.
Without
any
judgment
simply
stay
aware
as
you
give
yourself
permission
to
relax
deeper
and
deeper
.
Within
this
present
internal
awareness
begin
to
visualize
yourself
melting
deeper
and
deeper
into
your
relaxed
state
of
being
,
your
body
getting
heavier
as
you
open
your
heart
to
the
loving
energy
that
you
're
cultivating
from
within
.
Breathe
,
rest
and
let
go
,
just
let
go
.
Listening
to
the
sound
of
the
rain
,
let
yourself
be
filled
with
ease
,
serenity
bliss
and
deep
loving
relaxation
.
Breathe
in
,
breathe
out
and
let
go
.
Breathe
in
,
breathe
out
.
Now
as
we
finish
our
practice
together
you
are
more
than
welcome
to
lie
down
on
your
bed
and
use
this
beautiful
energy
that
you
have
cultivated
from
within
to
guide
you
into
a
deep
healing
and
relaxing
sleep
.
If
you
are
not
ready
for
sleep
yet
simply
bring
your
hands
together
in
Anjali
mudra
and
bow
down
to
your
heart
to
thank
yourself
for
giving
yourself
this
moment
of
peace
,
relaxation
and
healing
.
May
you
have
a
beautiful
night
.
Sleep
well
.

you
so

for
joining

today
for
our
meditation
practice
today
we're
going
to
take
this
time
together
to
simply
gift
ourselves
a
moment
of
stillness
and
peace
and
plugging
ourselves
from
the
external
world
of
action
and
constant
movement
and
giving
ourselves
this
opportunity
right
now
to
go
within
so
find
a
comfortable
place
to
sit
down
or
even
lay
down
if
you
need
to
just
be
careful
that
you
do
not
fall
asleep
if
you
're
seated
place
your
hands
on
your
knees
and
Jana
or
chin
mudra
where
you
connect
the
thumb
and
index
finger
or
simply
have
your
palms
open
resting
comfortably
on
your
knees
take
a
long
inhale
feeling
that
oxygen
entering
your
body
and
then
slowly
release
everything
with
your
gentle
and
calming
exhalation
give
yourself
and
your
mind
permission
to
settle
in
this
present
moment
feel
your
body
in
whatever
position
it
is
grounded
centered
and
relaxed
I
understand
the
mind
might
find
it
really
difficult
right
now
to
turn
off
the
thoughts
and
the
worries
but
know
that
you
are
in
control
of
your
mind
and
you
are
able
to
simply
make
a
choice
right
now
to
pause
just
pause
breathe
in
and
let
it
go
you
may
be
experiencing
a
lot
of
uncertainty
in
your
life
right
now
but
just
know
that
with
every
challenge
and
pain
we
are
faced
with
in
life
within
those
moments
is
where
incredible
strength
and
growth
develops
within
us
and
in
the
moment
of
pain
and
struggle
it
may
be
really
difficult
to
understand
that
there
is
something
we
will
take
from
this
that
it
will
help
us
along
this
path
of
human
experience
but
I
truly
believe
that
nothing
is
brought
to
us
without
a
greater
divine
purpose
of
evolving
us
through
this
journey
of
human
life
so
right
now
as
you
listen
to
my
voice
I
want
you
to
simply
exhale
and
let
all
of
that
fear
and
tension
melt
away
out
of
your
body
out
of
your
mind
out
of
your
being
even
just
for
this
moment
inhale
and
exhale
remember
that
there
is
great
power
within
you
and
that
power
will
guide
your
way
through
the
storm
believe
in
it
believe
in
yourself
and
never
allow
the
external
circumstances
of
the
outside
world
diminish
that
inner
flame
that
burns
within
you
I
want
you
to
take
another
deep
breath
in
and
simply
relax
everything
is
going
to
be
okay
take
another
deep
breath
in
allowing
yourself
to
settle
down
even
deeper
into
the
stillness
that
you
are
experiencing
externally
and
internally
at
this
very
moment
this
stillness
is
always
here
within
you
it
is
your
neutral
state
of
being
the
state
of
complete
presence
and
self
awareness
and
now
in
this
presence
we
are
going
to
come
back
to
our
cells
connect
to
our
heart
to
find
true
peace
and
love
that
is
within
us
take
another
deep
breath
in
and
let
it
go
feel
the
body
slowly
letting
go
feel
the
mind
slowly
letting
go
be
present
and
all
that
you
are
a
beautiful
radiant
being
of
light
breathe
in
and
-
welcome
calmness
and
peace
today
we
are
going
to
repeat
a
very
simple
mantra
of
gratitude
this
is
something
you
can
practice
every
morning
and
evening
or
any
time
of
the
day
a
phrase
and
mantra
that
allows
your
mind
to
focus
on
the
positive
beautiful
things
around
you
and
even
if
it
is
hard
for
you
to
find
something
to
be
grateful
for
right
now
as
you
may
be
going
through
a
very
difficult
time
in
your
life
but
just
remember
even
giving
things
for
the
most
simple
gifts
of
life
like
your
breath
like
having
this
moment
to
yourself
could
be
enough
to
begin
to
cultivate
that
beautiful
energy
from
within
so
as
you
allow
yourself
to
go
deeper
within
feel
free
to
place
your
hands
in
Anjali
mudra
or
some
call
it
the
prayer
position
with
the
palms
of
your
hands
together
or
you
can
just
keep
the
hands
exactly
where
they
are
in
here
I
just
want
you
to
repeat
a
very
simple
mantra
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
as
you
begin
to
say
these
simple
two
words
try
to
fully
feel
it
not
just
saying
the
words
themselves
but
attaching
this
energy
to
the
words
and
turning
it
into
gratitude
towards
the
universe
truly
feeling
it
within
you
and
speaking
it
from
your
heart
thank
you
for
my
breath
thank
you
for
my
strength
thank
you
and
allow
yourself
to
finish
that
sentence
with
whatever
comes
through
your
heart
as
you
repeat
this
simple
mantra
and
connect
deeper
to
your
heart
find
even
the
smallest
of
gifts
in
your
life
to
be
thankful
for
thank
you
for
the
strength
to
be
able
to
be
with
myself
in
this
time
thank
you
for
the
love
around
me
thank
you
for
the
support

to
repeat
this
from
your
heart

everything
that
's
beautiful
in
your
life
that
you
can
give
thanks
for

you
give

you
continue
to
repeat

and
allow
your
heart
to
speak
it
's
okay
to
feel
emotions
arising
if
they
do
just
send
your
love
and
gratitude
out
from
your
heart
and
watch

comes
up

you
now
slowly
feel
free
to
release
your
hands
back
to
your
knees
or
keep
them
wherever
is
comfortable
for
you
take
this
opportunity
to
come
back
to
your
breath
breathe
in
and
let
it
go
just
let
it
go
sit
with
this
feeling
within
you
right
now
notice
how
you
're
feeling
do
you
feel
lighter
do
you
feel
more
calm
perhaps
a
little
bit
more
blissful
become
aware
of
this
beautiful
energy
that
you
have
created
within
you
with
this
simple
mantra
of
gratitude
this
is
such
a
powerful
tool
for
us
to
use
in
everyday
life
but
especially
when
challenge
is
brought
forward
to
us
because
it
is
in
those
moments
when
our
mind
and
ego
clings
to
lack
and
fear
that
we
must
fight
to
keep
our
strength
and
presence
through
love
and
gratitude
I
encourage
you
to
practice
this
in
any
moment
you
find
throughout
your
day
whether
it
is
at
the
end
of
your
practice
before
bed
or
in
bed
when
you
wake
up
practice
being
grateful
for
the
miracles
of
life
that
we
get
to
experience
every
single
day
each
breath
each
day
is
a
blessing
if
you
choose
to
see
it
that
way
and
the
choice
lies
within
you
feel
free
to
stay
where
you
are
in
this
beautiful
peaceful
presence
or
feel
free
to
now
slowly
begin
to
open
your
eyes
and
simply
sit
with
yourself
give
yourself
time
to
process
everything
or
simply
breathe
in
total
silence
and
stillness
may
you
be
blessed
with
health
with
strength
and
with
all
the
love
that
you
deserve

you
for
being
here
with
me
on

has
been
an

welcome
to
your
perfect
morning
meditation
to
still
the
mind
and
execute
a
perfect
day
the
key
to
this
meditation
is
allowing
yourself
to
let
go
to
let
go
of
all
that
arises
during
the
next
10
minutes
inside
your
mind
and
body
letting
go
of
emotions
that
stir
thoughts
that
appear
and
any
physical
or
mental
discomfort
that
may
arise
in
this
day
and
age
it
's
not
easy
to
surrender
to
a
still
mind
we
are
constantly
baited
into
a
never-ending
habit
loop
of
filling
the
emptiness
with
whatever
our
minds
can
latch
onto
but
here
right
now
this
morning
we
are
going
to
compassionately
take
our
power
back
and
with
our
new
empowered
sense
of
control
we
are
going
to
let
go
of
everything
so
throughout
the
next
10
minutes
anytime
anything
interrupts
your
stillness
whether
you
your
mind
or
external
sources
with
forgiveness
and
empathy
in
our
hearts
and
a
conscious
understanding
that
letting
go
is
the
actual
exercise
so
without
these
distractions
coming
forward
we
would
have
nothing
to
let
go
of
in
the
first
place
so
as
your
thoughts
begin
to
invade
the
stillness
as
they
always
will
try
to
watch
them
like
a
cloud
as
they
float
in
just
invite
them
to
leave
and
as
they
do
without
judgment
just
reground
yourself
and
resettle
into
the
stillness
that
you
're
working
so
effortlessly
to
cultivate
so
now
find
a
quiet
place
with
me
and
let's
settle
into
a
few
conscious
breaths
to
establish
the
thread
to
which
we
will
always
return
take
a
deep
slow
inhale
feeling
your
lungs
expand
and
then
hold
it
just
when
you
have
all
the
air
you
can
for
a
single
moment
before
steadily
releasing
the
breath
through
your
nostrils
with
a
long
exhale
only
to
repeat
again
slowly
over
and
over
finding
your
natural
rhythm
of
breathing
and
holding
at
the
peak
and
then
again
when
completely
empty
as
you
breathe
try
to
focus
your
mind
on
the
air
entering
and
leaving
your
nostrils
and
the
sensation
of
your
lungs
and
chest
slowly
expanding
and
retracting
breathing
in
slowly
holding
for
that
moment
and
then
exhaling
out
allowing
yourself
to
sink
deeper
and
deeper
into
this
moment
as
you
invite
your
focused
consciousness
to
reveal
itself
with
each
new
breath
your
breath
this
moment
remember
whatever
arises
in
you
it
's
perfect
because
it
creates
an
opportunity
for
you
to
release
it
to
let
go
and
find
your
next
breath
returning
to
your
focus
returning
to
this
moment
wherever
you
are
right
now
knowing
that
this
is
exactly
where
you
're
supposed
to
be
breathing
in
slowly
perfectly
and
then
holding
just
for
that
moment
before
action
and
reaction
finding
that
peak
feeling
exactly
how
exhilarating
it
can
be
and
releasing
slowly
until
your
lungs
are
completely
empty
and
pausing
there
again
just
long
enough
to
revel
in
that
emptiness
that
right
there
is
your
moment
of
pure
conscious
bliss
[

breathing
in
deeply
slowly
perfectly
hold
and
exhale
out
slowly
again
allowing
it
to
naturally
unfold
emptying
the
lungs
and
hold
then
repeat
now
i
'd
like
to
invite
you
if
it
makes
sense
to
your
practice
to
add
in
this
mantra
for
the
remainder
of
our
time
here
today
simply
whisper
these
words
for
the
first
time
after
me
and
then
continue
in

open

today

open
myself
to
today
and
all
that
will
unfold
if

when
you
fall
away
from
this
mantra
remember
that
is
the
exercise
so
without
judgment
simply
let
go
of
it
and
return
back
to
your
breathing

to
this
mantra
itself

foreignhey
guys
welcome
to
meditation
day
8
im
so
happy
that
you
've
taken
this
time
out
of
your
day
and
dedicating
it
to
yourself
and
your
wellbeing
todays
meditation
will
be
confused
on
manifesting
your
dreams
every
single
one
of
us
has
a
different
goal
and
dream
and
the
beauty
of
it
all
is
that
our
thoughts
play
avery
important
part
our
words
are
very
powerful
vibrations
that
we
put
out
into
the
universe
reflect
the
outcome
we
almost
always
end
up
attracting
ask
yourself
what
are
your
dreams
what
do
you
aspire
to
achieve
sometimes
we
hide
from
our
dreams
because
they
're
too
scrary
to
admit
to
ourselves
and
our
fear
of
failure
makes
avoiding
them
very
easy
I
'm

to
our
meditation
practice
today
's
intention
for
our
time
together
is
to
help
the
mind
find
peace
and
balance
especially
to
help
ourselves
cope
with
the
uncertainty
of
our
world
at
this
time
let
us
begin
today
by
finding
a
comfortable
seated
position
you
can
sit
on
your
bed
against
the
wall
or
on
a
comfortable
cushion
if
you
have
one
let
's
begin
by
closing
our
eyes
and
taking
both
our
hands
and
placing
them
upon
our
heart
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
listen
to
your
own
heart
beating
in
your
chest
what
each
beat
may
it
remind
you
of
this
beautiful
energy
life
prana
that
is
within
you
with
each
beat
may
take
you
deeper
within
at
this
time
into
the
internal
experience
of
your
own
being
take
a
deep
breath
in
through
your
nose
no
long
exhalation
out
allowing
yourself
to
find
this
presence
comfort
and
grounding
within
you
slowly
release
your
hands
onto
your
lap
let's
take
the
chin
hand
mudra
where
we
place
the
thumb
and
index
finger
together
allowing
the
palm
of
the
hand
to
face
upward
creating
a
seal
of
energy
within
your
body
close
your
eyes
and
allow
yourself
to
go
even
deeper
focusing
your
awareness
to
the
space
between
your
eyebrows
your
third
eye
simply
focus
and
notice
if
you
begin
to
see
any
shapes
or
colors
or
perhaps
just
complete
emptiness
and
blackness
no
judgment
here
just
simply
observe

breathing
and
let
it
go
allow
your
body
to
let
go
of
any
tension
in
your
face
relaxing
your
forehead
allowing
your
eyes
to
feel
heavy
and
clenching
your
jaw
complete
relaxation
of
the
face
then
move
this
relaxation
downward
towards
your
shoulders
your
arms
and
then
down
towards
your
hips
and
your
legs
just
let
it
go
simply
stay
present
noticing
the
movement
of
your
breath
as
you
breathe
in
and
out
begin
to
notice
any
sensations
in
your
body
feeling
the
coolness
of
the
air
coming
into
your
nostrils
as
you
breathe
in
and
then
the
warmth
of
the
air
leaving
your
nostrils
as
you
breathe
out
[

notice
if
you
begin
to
feel
any
tingling
sensations
in
your
fingers
or
your
toes
whatever
you
are
experiencing
right
now
just
simply
notice
it
be
the
watcher
of
the
experience
itself
allow
yourself
to
find
peace
enjoy
in
this
simple
moment
of
silence
and
disconnection
you
deserve
it
[
Music
]
this
is
a
time
where
it
's
very
normal
for
our
minds
to
begin
to
want
to
cling
to
something
a
specific
thought
a
memory
a
daydream
or
perhaps
even
fear
or
the
future
it
will
go
in
many
directions
and
that
's
okay
simply
remember
to
use
your
breath
whenever
you
feel
yourself
drifting
away
from
this
present
moment
use
your
breath
to
come
back
to
yourself
to
this
moment
right
here
right
now
wherever
you
are
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
a
long
and
soft
exhale
of
breathing
exhale
out
in
this
moment
it
's
okay
to
realize
that
you
may
be
feeling
uncertainty
stress
or
anxiety
in
your
life
but
remember
it
is
simply
a
reaction
to
the
circumstances
around
you
which
is
creating
a
future
that
has
not
happened
yet
and
wo
n't
necessarily
happen
either
even
though
we
may
not
be
able
to
control
what
life
brings
our
way
at
this
time
what
we
do
have
control
over
is
how
we
react
to
the
challenges
or
any
situations
that
are
brought
forward
to
us
so
breathe
in
and
in
this
moment
choose
to
let
all
that
negative
energy
go
release
it
out
of
you
into
the
ground
into
the
earth
choose
to
find
peace
enjoy
in
the
simplicity
of
this
very
moment
simply
being
here
with
yourself
giving
yourself
permission
to
feel
to
be
to
let
go
breathe
in
and
exhale
out

inhalation

exhalation

the
tension

light
to
you
all
namasteWelcome
to
our
meditation
for
living
truthfully
in
our
meditation
today
our
focus
will
be
on
finding
truth
Love
and
beauty
within
ourselves
So
that
we
can
project
it
out
into
the
world
around
us
Many
of
us
so
often
tend
to
complicate
life
in
many
ways
We
feel
that
we
must
have
a
specific
job
title
On
a
specific
car
or
live
in
a
particular
neighborhood
in
order
to
truly
feel
happy
and
accomplished
with
ourselves
in
our
lives
Yes
all
of
these
things
are
wonderful
in
many
ways
,
but
they
are
not
the
root
of
our
happiness
Actually
finding
happiness
is
quite
simple
It
does
n't
come
with
a
price
tag
because
it
is
here
within
us
every
single
day
if
we
simply
choose
to
look
a
little
closer
Observing
sometimes
can
be
the
first
tool
in
helping
you
find
happiness
Seeing
the
beauty
of
our
existence
around
us
whether
that
is
a
smile
of
a
child
a
beautiful
sunset
the
smell
of
the
ocean
Or
the
leaves
falling
off
a
tree
on
a
sunny
autumn
day
Happiness
lies
in
the
simple
things
and
once
we
open
our
eyes
to
the
everyday
miracles
of
life
existence
itself
becomes
a
miracle
Once
we
start
to
see
how
magical
life
really
is
we
must
look
a
little
closer
Everyone
around
us
that
shares
similar
walk
of
life
the
human
existence
Yes
,
we
may
have
our
differences
in
politics
or
religions
,
or
simply
how
we
see
the
world
around
us
But
in
the
end
if
we
truly
realize
that
we
''
re
all
Two-legged
breathing
talking
loving
human
beings
we
will
all
begin
to
realize
that
we
are
all
the
same
We
are
all
in
this
together
We
are
all
one
We
all
want
to
be
happy
healthy
and
loved
Accepting
this
idea
is
one
of
the
ways
in
helping
us
understand
one
another
a
little
better
Understand
that
we
are
all
struggling
in
our
own
personal
ways
We
all
want
to
be
loved
and
heard
in
one
way
or
another
and
that
we
all
want
to
find
that
happiness
whatever
Way
happiness
looks
to
us
Once
we
start
to
understand
that
behind
the
egos
and
the
power
games
deep
down
We
all
share
the
same
goals
and
purpose
We
will
see
that
the
only
way
to
living
authentically
and
truthfully
is
through
opening
your
minds
to
all
paths
and
ideas
of
life
With
that
said
let
's
begin
our
meditation
Begin
by
sitting
comfortably
on
your
mat
your
bed
or
the
floor
Close

eyes
Rest
your

Relax
your
face
Let
go
of
any
motion
in
the
forehead
allow
your
eyes
to
feel
heavy
and
clench
your
jaw
Just
simply
allow
all
that
tension
to
release
out
of
your
face
and
then
out
of
your
shoulders
Feeling
yourself
grounded
and
appease
Paying
attention
to
your
inhale
and
your
exhale
as
you
let
go
of
everything
else
Feel
the
coolness
of
the
air
as
you
breathe
in
and
the
warm
of
the
airs
you
exhale
Let
go
of
any
thoughts
to
duel
us
or
plants
just
simply
be
with
yourself
Inhale
And
exhale
Notice
how
you
're
feeling
right
now
Do
you
feel
any
tension
in
your
body
Pay
close
attention
And
with
each
exhale
let
it
go
Let
slowly

her
mantra
for
today

this
mantra
in
your
mind
are
Simply
using
it
to
bring
you
back
to
the
present
moment
if
your
mind
begins
to
go
elsewhere

one
without

with
all
And
now
silently
in
your
mind
Until
you
hear
a
soft
Bell
letting
you
know
that
it
's
time
to
release
the
mantra
It
's
time
to

the
mantra
Slowly
begin
to
deepen
the
breath
Inhale
and
exhale
Take
your
time
here

May
sit
in
this
stillness
for
as
long
as
you
like
Or
if
you
're
ready

ahead
and
open
your
eyes

go
on
through
your
day
try
to
stay
present

youIn
this
meditation
session
,
we
will
take
some
time
to
remind
ourselves
of
what
we
are
capable
of
...
To
build
ourselves
up
.
We
have
strength
.
We
have
drive
.
We
have
motivation
to
do
our
absolute
best
.
Allow
this
time
to
be
set
aside
as
your
own
.
A
welcome
reprieve
from
the
many
thoughts
and
decisions
running
through
your
mind
throughout
each
day
.
It
is
good
to
remember
that
we
are
often
more
than
the
roadblocks
that
sometimes
come
up
in
our
minds
.
And
we
can
break
through
them
.
You
got
this
.
To
get
us
settled
into
focusing
on
our
breath
,
I
encourage
you
to
continue
taking
comfortable
and
natural
breaths
.
Let
it
flow
comfortably
and
naturally
again
focusing
on
your
breath
in
and
out
.
I
invite
you
to
take
this
opportunity
to
calm
your
mind
and
relax
your
body
.
Just
repeat
these
short
affirmation
phrases
in
your
head
.
With
this
next
breath
cycle
...
I
relax
my
eyes
.
With
this
next
breath
cycle
...
I
relax
my
shoulders
.
With
this
next
breath
cycle
...
I
relax
my
arms
.
With
this
next
breath
cycle
...
I
relax
my
legs
.
And
with
this
next
breath
cycle
...
I
relax
my
entire
body
.
As
you
remain
here
in
this
comfortable
space
,
continue
that
awareness
of
your
breath
,
your
body
,
the
space
that
you
are
in
.
You
can
focus
your
gaze
gently
on
a
space
across
the
room
...
or
allow
your
eyes
to
close
.
Just
remaining
alert
yet
content
throughout
this
time
.
Feeling
that
breath
flow
through
your
nostrils
...
muscles
relaxed
...
present
and
at
peace
.
We
all
face
challenges
day
in
and
day
out
.
And
you
are
ambitions
.
Driven
.
You
have
high
expectations
for
yourself
.
And
sometimes
,
maybe
even
subconsciously
in
your
mind
...
you
may
doubt
yourself
.
Something
may
seem
too
challenging
...
too
difficult
.
You
come
across
a
roadblock
and
feel
as
though
you
just
ca
n't
get
past
it
.
This
is
when
we
remind
ourselves
of
the
simple
phrase
that
brings
us
back
to
the
present
moment
.
That
helps
us
to
remember
what
we
are
truly
capable
of
.
I
.
Got
.
This
.
I
.
GOT
THIS
.
And
the
challenge
that
we
face
is
how
we
take
on
these
ambitious
tasks
and
goals
that
we
have
laid
out
in
front
of
us
.
And
yet
,
be
at
peace
moment
to
moment
and
see
a
clear
path
laid
out
for
ourselves
.
We
will
now
do
an
affirmation
exercise
to
reshape
our
thought
cycle
and
begin
to
more
clearly
define
the
path
forward
.
So
,
in
this
exercise
,
repeat
after
me
,
either
out
loud
or
in
your
head
.
And
we
will
use
visualization
techniques
to
shape
our
thoughts
...
to
take
us
to
another
place
.
We
begin
now
:
A
clear
blue
lake
.
A
warm
sun
overhead
.
Birds
in
the
sky
.
A
sandy
beach
.
I
take
a
step
..
Enjoying
the
process
.
One
foot
in
front
of
the
next
.
All
in
a
row
.
No
worry
.
No
fear
.
Just
each
.
next
.
step
.
Just
each
...
next
...
step
.
Great
.
Is
n't
it
wonderful
how
we
can
reshape
our
patterns
of
thought
?
We
can
so
easily
get
lost
in
the
stresses
and
anxiety
.
And
yet
,
we
realize
that
we
can
so
quickly
bring
it
back
.
We
can
learn
to
think
in
steps
just
like
on
the
sandy
and
sunny
beach
.
Placing
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
and
enjoying
each
step
.
And
if
we
sometimes
forget
...
we
remember
that
there
is
always
a
next
step
,
and
it
can
be
a
peaceful
,
enjoyable
step
.
We
can
learn
to
love
and
enjoy
the
process
and
remind
ourselves
of
this
whenever
we
become
lost
.
And
so
,
for
one
last
very
short
affirmation
cycle
...
in
a
moment
you
will
repeat
after
me
and
remember
that
you
are
brilliant
.
You
are
kind
.
You
are
capable
.
And
anytime
you
need
to
remind
yourself
of
this
,
just
return
back
to
the
beach
.
The
waves
.
The
warm
sun
.
And
take
a
step
.
So
now
...
Just
repeat
these
short
phrases
:
I
am
strong
.
I
am
enough
.
I
can
do
this
.
I
...

calmly
in
and
out
of
your
nostrils
and
notice
your
chest
moving
gently
up
and
down
this
will
be
your
anchor
into
the
present
moment
don't
force
yourself
to
change
your
breathing
pattern
simply
pay
attention
to
it
studying
to
familiarize
yourself
with
it
let
yourself
become
fully
aware
gently
and
end
out
as
you
do
so
allow
this
awareness
to
spread
throughout
your
body
feel
your
nerve
endings
from
the
very
top
of
your
head
all
the
way
through
down
your
shoulders
into
your
legs
and
feel
that
warm
relaxing
sensation
move
all
the
way
down
out
the
tips
of
your
toes
in
doing
so
you
may
realize
how
powerful
of
a
sense
we
have
of
our
own
bodies
and
space
yet
how
little
we
pay
attention
you
may
observe
what
is
the
temperature
of
the
room
what
are
the
subtle
sounds
going
on
around
us
how
does
the
chair
or
floor
feel
against
your
body
what
other
sensations
do
you
notice
developing
a
calm
sense
of
your
surroundings
is
such
a
simple
process
yet
it
can
be
so
rewarding
it
's
about
this
time
and
space
that
is
yours
if
only
for
this
fleeting
moment
of
time
continue
to
maintain
focus
and
attention
on
your
breathing
again
slowly
in
and
out
feeling
the
air
against
your
nostrils
in
your
chest
moving
gently
up
and
down
now
comes
the
key
to
the
session
in
a
moment
we
will
take
one
minute
to
practice
this
meditation
technique
and
it
's
a
simple
one
as
you
continue
your
breath
focus
take
notice
when
that
first
stray
thought
floats
through
your
mind
it
might
be
a
serious
thought
or
just
a
frivolous
one
whatever
it
may
be
simply
recognize
it
observe
it
and
watch
it
then
use
your
following
breath
to
allow
it
to
float
away
ever
so
effortlessly
and
as
you
continue
to
focus
on
your
breathing
another
thought
will
soon
come
along
recognize
it
as
quickly
as
possible
again
observe
it
recognize
allow
yourself
to
become
disassociated
with
it
then
use
your
following
breath
to
allow
it
to
float
away
just
observing
just
watching
do
this
again
and
again
and
again
your
thoughts
may
come
occasionally
or
in
quick
succession
whatever
the
case
do
not
mentally
punish
yourself
for
these
thoughts
simply
continue
to
recognize
and
let
them
go
over
and
over
let
's
now
take
that
minute
to
put
this
into
practice
focusing
on
breath
recognizing
thoughts
and
lighting
them
go
again
and
again
and
we
'll
begin
now
great
this
is
all
you
need
to
get
started
and
it
's
available
to
you
anytime
during
that
minute
if
you
felt
as
though
you
had
difficulty
controlling
thoughts
or
recognizing
thoughts
it's
okay
just
keep
working
on
that
's
why
it
's
called
practice
you
may
want
to
try
starting
with
a
minute
a
day
or
work
your
way
up
little
by
little
each
day
even
just
taking
a
minute
of
your
time
at
home
or
at
your
job
when
you're
feeling
overwhelmed
can
help
you
to
become
more
centered
and
balanced
there
's
really
no
wrong
way
to
go
about
it
except
to
keep
practicing
and
slowly
getting
better
moment
by
moment
day
by
day
and
even
year
by
year
there
's
really
no
limit
to
the
progress
you
can
make
at
this
point
the
musical
soundscape
will
continue
for
about
five
more
minutes
if
you
wish
continue
to
use
this
time
to
practice
remember
focusing
on
breath
recognizing
stray
thoughts
and
letting
them
drift
away
no
forcing
no
judgment
just
returning
to
presence
again
and
again
eventually
this
will
begin
to
happen
all
on
its
own
breath
awareness
and
presence
it
's
all
there
for
the
taking
the
end
of
the
session
begins
now
you
you
you
youmeditation
it
's
all
about
overwhelm
and
if
you
're
listening
to
this
episode
right
when
it
comes
out
we
're
starting
the
holiday
season
and
so
I
wanted
to
create
something
that
you
could
come
back
to
throughout
the
months
the
weeks
to
Center
yourself
and
release
some
of
that
overwhelmed
energy
we're
going
to
start
with
three
deep
breaths
in
for
three
holding
for
three
and
out
for
three
so

now
I
want
you
to
think
about
a
happy
memory
whether
that
be
of
a
holiday
season
or
just
happy
adventure
or
day
that
you
've
had
this
year
and
I
want
you
to
Envision
it
as
clear
as
you
possibly
can
what
does
it
look
like
anything
that
you
smell
what
can
you
touch
who
do
you
hear
what
do
you
hear
who
is
around
you
if
anyone
[
Music

[

once
you
have
that
Vision
in
your
mind
clear
as
day
I
want
you
to
know
think
about
one
thing
that
you
can
do
to
remove
a
little
semblance
of
overwhelm
I
'm
going
to
give
you
a
few
examples
that
could
be
writing
down
all
of
the
tasks
that
you
have
that
could
be
tackling
one
major
project
this
week
that
could
be
focusing
on
small
little
tasks
each
day
I
want
you
to
think
about
that
one
thing
that
you
can
do
just
one
[
Music
]
now
that
you
have
that
task
in
your
mind
I
want
you
to
Envision
yourself
finishing
it
foreign
how
you
might
feel
the
emotions
that
might
come
up
while
you
do
it
[
Music

the
lightness
that
you
feel
now
with
that
task
has
been
accomplished
I
want
you
to
feel
it
deep

inside

it
in
your
body
in
your
mind
in
your
heart

down
your
legs
and
your
arms
and
your
neck
and
in
your
shoulders
in
your
belly
and
in
your
chest
and
I
want
you
to
sit
for
the
next
little
while
breathing
deeply

in

for
three

breathing
in
those
good
feelings

relaxed
feelings

foreign
[
Music

as
you
continue
to
feel
these
feelings
I
want
you
to
start
wiggling
your
toes
and
your
fingers
bringing
yourself
back
into
the
space
that
you
're
in
[
Music
]
and
bring
that
feeling
into
your
day
into
that
one
task
that
you
're
gon
na
compete
and

back
to
this
episode
anytime
you
might
need
to
release
yourself
from
the
overwhelm

seated
position
or
lie
down

very
moment
welcoming
your

body
to
this
Stillness

and
honoring
this
time
you
have
set
aside
for
your
own
nourishment
to
care
for
and
attend
to
the
self
inside
and
out
thanking
yourself
for
this
with
your
palms
open
wide
facing
upwards
Towards
the
Sky
and
resting
comfortably
on
your
knees
or
thighs
begin
taking
notice
of
the
breath
watch
as
your
body
releases
control
and
allows
you
to
take
the
wheel
surrendering
to
your
capable
hands
the
dance
begins
to
unfold
as
you
find
a
rhythm
between
the
inhale
and
the
exhale
feeling
yourself
creating
space
within
your
body
with
each
nourishing
breath
breathing
deeply
down
into
the
belly
allowing
for
the
organs
to
move
down
out
of
the
way
and
the
lungs
to
expand
fully
within
the
ribcage
taking
full
advantage
of
this
life-sustaining
oxygen
and
refueling
each
cell
within
that
magnificent
body
of
yours
breathing
awareness
into
this
Divine
Temple
free
breath
down
taking
notice
releasing
any
energetic
baggage
that
may
have
presented
itself
maybe
as
repetitive
negative
self-talk
or
harsh
emotions
that
may
have
arrived
breathing
in
through
your
nose
belly
Rising
ailing
in
the
belly
Falls
breathing
in
through
the
nose
belly
Rising
exhaling
in
belly
Falls
breathing
in
the
rising
and
exhaling
as
your
belly
Falls
allowing
the
breath
to
massage
wash
every
expression
of
you
every
facet
of
your
being
every
curve
every
hair
every
finger
and
toe
that
is
perfectly
you
breathing
into
any
areas
of
tightness
of
tension
of
neglected
emotion
noticing
and
taking
your
breath
there
bringing
a
softness
and
ease
just
releasing
anything
that
doesn't
support
you
today
it
does
n't
feel
good
noticing
any
discomfort
give
your
loving
attention
to
it
and
allow
it
to
soften
with
each
mindful
breath
using
the
gentle
rhythm
of
your
breath
to
cleanse
the
clear
to
nourish
and
fill
you
up
mindfully
breathing
down
into
the
belly
taking
that
nourishing
breath
all
throughout
your
body
delivering
this
resource
delivering
your
attention
to
each
space
within
your
body
craving
that
attention
craving
that
noticing
today
you
stop
the
soul
eroding
habit
of
allowing
the
harsh
words
of
the
external
world
to
take
up
residence
in
your
mind
to
dictate
how
you
move
and
how
you
feel
today
you
stand
guard
at
the
doors
of
your
mind
and
today
you
decide
words
you
continue
to
speak
to
yourself
the
way
you
choose
to
support
yourself
to
talk
to
yourself
you
have
the
ability
to
provide
the
depth
of
support
you
've
been
craving
for
so
long

three
deep
breaths
infusing
each
wave
with
the
energetically
charged
words

'll
speak
together
now

marinate
in
their
truth

their
wisdom

the
sacred
knowledge
lost
in
the
flood
of
technology

information
in
this
fast-paced
world
we
live
in
today
a
world
often
disconnected
from

environment
from
the
healing
magic
found
within
us
the
interconnectedness
of
all
things
found
on
this
perfect
blue
ball
cruising
through
an
ever-expanding
Universe
of
Stardust

spark
for
life

your
life

vibrational
energy
you
have
found
melt
away
all
the
negative
emotions
let
it
re-light
that
spark
let
it
melt
away
anything
weighing
you
down
being
this
unconditional
love
into
any
thoughts
that
stem
from
feeling
unworthy
comparing
to
others
ideals
or
judging
yourself
harshly
see
this
conditioning
for
what
it
is
involuntary
thoughts
planted
by
others
insecurities
and
grown
over
years
of
social
pressures
these
thoughts
do
not
belong
to
you
although
they
are
real
does
not
mean
they
are
true
dear
one
they
are
just
one
more
thing
picked
up
along
the
way
that
you
can
decide
to
let
go
of
to
move
on
from
feel
the
energetic
shift
of
every
cell
within
your
body
in

youThis
is
a
guided
mindfulness
meditation
about
caring
for
yourself
and
going
easy
on
yourself
.
The
focus
of
this
session
is
to
bring
attention
to
the
amount
of
pressure
that
we
often
put
on
ourselves
.
We
will
come
to
realize
that
although
it
can
be
healthy
to
hold
ourselves
to
a
high
standard
,
we
can
raise
awareness
that
unnecessarily
beating
ourselves
up
can
deteriorate
our
mental
state
.
Allow
yourself
to
sit
comfortably
,
yet
alert
.
Take
this
time
to
bring
an
awareness
to
your
body
and
to
your
breathing
.
Just
take
calming
and
gentle
breaths
,
in
and
out
.
And
begin
to
enjoy
being
in
the
present
moment
.
You
can
let
go
of
any
ruminations
about
the
past
and
any
worries
about
the
future
.
Continuing
to
breathe
gently
and
naturally
,
feel
that
air
movement
in
and
out
of
your
nostrils
.
And
that
gentle
movement
of
your
chest
,
as
you
relax
all
throughout
your
body
.
Especially
relaxing
your
neck
and
shoulders
.
Letting
the
tension
out
of
your
arms
and
legs
.
Just
letting
your
body
sink
into
the
surface
that
you
are
in
.
As
you
find
this
place
of
peace
and
comfort
,
I
am
going
to
pose
several
questions
.
That
will
give
you
about
30
seconds
to
think
about
that
question
and
see
what
answers
come
to
your
mind
.
These
are
questions
and
suggestions
that
you
can
ask
yourself
throughout
each
day
.
The
first
is
:
''
Is
there
something
in
particular
that
you
are
currently
challenging
yourself
with
,
that
may
be
causing
your
anxiety
or
stress
?
''
``
What
thoughts
or
emotions
arise
when
you
become
stressed
about
challenging
situations
?
Are
there
any
mental
cycles
that
you
hope
to
break
?
''
And
as
the
third
question
,
''
Are
there
any
certain
symptoms
that
you
notice
when
you
think
about
having
stress
and
anxiety
?
Do
you
catch
certain
thoughts
that
cause
that
anxiety
and
stress
?
''
Great
.
And
again
,
take
these
thoughts
with
you
and
take
the
time
to
occasionally
as
yourself
them
during
each
day
.
This
will
help
you
recognize
the
source
of
anxiety
and
stress
and
will
help
you
to
better
manage
it
as
you
face
those
challenges
throughout
each
day
.
Now
,
we
will
take
the
time
to
repeat
some
short
mantras
.
With
each
short
phrase
,
feel
free
to
repeat
it
either
out
loud
or
just
in
your
head
.
As
a
reminder
,
continuing
to
sit
comfortably
,
stay
grounded
in
the
present
moment
,
just
focused
on
your
breath
and
my
voice
.
Breath
and
voice
.
As
your
body
stays
loose
and
comfortable
.
And
we
will
begin
these
mantras
now
.
``
I
am
a
strong
person
.
''
``
I
am
thoughtful
and
kind
.
''
``
I
deserve
to
love
myself
.
''
``
I
deserve
to
forgive
myself
.
''
``
I
deserve
joy
.
''
``
I
deserve
peace
.
''
``
I
deserve
a
still
and
contented
mind
.
''
Let
these
ideas
sink
in
deeply
,
and
enjoy
them
.
We
will
go
through
them
just
once
more
.
And
again
,
feel
them
deeply
.
Feel
them
even
more
profoundly
.
Let
these
mantras
be
at
the
forefront
of
your
mind
as
you
go
into
the
coming
days
.
I
will
begin
a
modified
version
of
these
mantras
now
.
``
Remembering
my
strength
.
''
``
Remembering
my
thoughtfulness
and
kindness
.
''
``
Remembering
to
love
myself
.
''
``
Remembering
to
forgive
myself
.
''
``
Remembering
to
feel
joy
.
''
``
Remembering
to
feel
at
peace
.
''
``
Remembering
to
keep
a
still
and
contented
mind
.
''
Awesome
.
Take
this
with
you
today
and
throughout
the
weeks
to
come
.
There
will
be
just
a
few
more
minutes
of
ambient
music
,
so
allow
yourself
to
either
end
this
meditation
now
,
or
gently
feel
yourself
come
back
and
be
ready
for
the
next
step
in
your
day
or
night
.
Thank
you
for
spending
this
time
with
me
.
That
will
end
the
spoken
portion
of
this
meditation
,
now

of

aware

your

the
feeling

become
increasingly

increasingly
centered
you
are
now
open
to
contemplate
the
topic
of
this
meditation
you
continuing
to
gently
breathe
to
raise
your
awareness
to
feel
the
space
around
you
you
'll
focus
on
this
concept
of
accepting
and
letting
go
take
a
moment
and
imagine
an
incident
long
in
the
past
that
gives
you
regret
something
that
pops
into
your
minds
fairly
often
maybe
you
said
something
wrong
maybe
you
hurt
somebody
's
feelings
maybe
you
felt
embarrassed
by
something
you
did
whatever
it
was
think
about
the
amount
of
time
that
you
have
spent
thinking
back
on
that
time
when
you
look
at
it
in
this
context
does
n't
it
seem
like
a
waste
of
our
energy
does
n't
it
seem
unnecessary
what
does
it
accomplish
for
us
to
relive
these
moments
in
the
past
the
answer
is
often
nothing
of
course
it
is
always
good
to
be
conscious
of
our
mistakes
and
make
situations
right
when
we
must
but
what
we
also
must
learn
is
how
to
recognize
the
beneficial
awareness
while
discarding
the
useless
regret
and
anxiety
that
only
serves
to
make
us
feel
bad
without
resolving
anything
as
you
remain
focused
on
this
skull
let
us
continue
to
deepen
our
understanding
by
maintaining
our
awareness
on
my
voice
and
your
breath
and
the
space
around
you
slowly
gently
in
and
out
we
can

This
is
a
guided
mindfulness
meditation
on
living
for
today
.
Feel
free
to
find
a
comfortable
place
to
sit
,
and
just
find
your
own
calming
space
to
be
in
for
a
little
while
.
And
as
you
get
comfortable
,
just
bring
your
focus
to
your
breathing
,
in
and
out
.
Just
gently
and
naturally
.
Allow
yourself
to
feel
a
sense
of
calm
wash
over
you
.
Right
here
in
your
place
.
Here
in
your
time
.
And
I
'll
just
do
a
slow
countdown
now
,
continuing
to
focus
on
that
gentle
natural
and
relaxed
breath
.
Counting
now
:
Five
.
Four
Three
.
Two
.
One
.
And
as
you
deeply
feel
this
calm
and
presence
,
I
invite
you
to
imagine
your
childhood
.
Think
of
a
feeling
like
when
you
would
play
outside
with
friends
.
Fun
,
free
,
excited
.
As
we
grow
up
,
we
know
that
our
lives
become
busier
,
more
responsibilities
,
more
expectations
.
More
stress
to
weigh
us
down
.
We
may
long
for
that
childhood-like
wonder
of
youth
.
As
we
can
so
often
fall
into
the
trap
of
worrying
about
the
future
and
dwelling
on
the
past
.
With
so
much
to
do
,
we
may
feel
that
there
is
no
time
to
live
in
the
present
moment
.
But
of
course
,
this
is
the
trick
of
the
mind
that
so
easily
allows
us
to
get
lost
.
But
knowing
the
path
back
to
the
present
moment
can
allow
us
to
become
found
again
.
We
have
within
each
of
us
the
ability
to
live
for
today
right
here
and
now
.
Enjoying
and
taking
in
each
moment
.
Grateful
and
willing
to
embrace
this
time
in
this
place
.
And
,
in
learning
this
,
we
can
realize
that
this
moment
,
right
here
and
now
,
is
truly
all
we
ever
have
.
And
it
is
truly
beautiful
to
be
right
here
,
each
moment
.
And
therefore
,
we
can
practice
and
learn
the
true
meaning
of
living
for
today
.
It
is
the
ability
to
maintain
a
balance
of
our
responsibilities
,
while
still
always
recognizing
and
living
right
here
in
the
now
.
It
's
also
reminding
ourselves
to
bring
ourselves
back
,
should
we
get
lost
,
distracted
,
fearful
,
or
overwhelmed
.
And
so
,
now
,
we
will
deepen
our
thoughts
of
presence
and
mindfulness
of
living
for
today
by
doing
some
short
affirmations
.
And
so
if
you
like
,
you
can
repeat
these
,
either
out
loud
or
in
your
head
.
As
I
remind
you
to
continue
sitting
comfortably
,
breathing
naturally
with
that
breath
focus
.
We
will
start
now
.
``
In
this
moment
.
''
``
I
feel
presence
and
peace
.
''
``
In
this
moment
.
''
``
I
feel
childlike
wonder
.
''
``
In
this
moment
.
''
``
Content
and
grateful
.
''
``
In
this
moment
.
''
``
Living
for
each
day
.
''
Great
.
And
now
we
will
do
the
same
exercise
,
but
this
time
,
focusing
on
the
days
to
come
.
So
we
will
start
again
,
now
.
``
Each
day
,
I
will
remember
.
''
``
Presence
and
peace
.
''
``
Each
day
,
I
will
embrace
.
''
``
Childlike
wonder
.
''
``
Each
day
,
I
will
be
.
``
Content
and
grateful
.
''
``
Each
day
,
I
will
live
.
''
``
A
rich
and
joyful
life
.
''
Very
nice
.
Even
through
challenges
,
we
can
embrace
and
live
a
rich
and
joyful
life
.
Keep
this
in
your
mind
and
in
your
heart
.
Remember
to
be
present
and
free
,
just
as
you
would
as
a
child
,
running
outside
,
without
a
care
in
the
world
.
As
a
child
,
you
did
n't
need
to
strive
for
it
.
The
process
of
letting
go
of
all
of
that
baggage
of
the
mind
just
happened
.
And
it
can
happen
to
you
again
.
Feel
this
deeply
within
you
,
and
come
back
to
these
ideas
any
day
or
time
that
you
like
.
Whenever
you
need
a
reminder
.
Remembering
each
moment
.
Present
,
peaceful
,
grateful
,
joyful
.
Living
for
today
.
Now
you
can
continue
with
silent
meditation
if
you
wish
,
for
a
while
longer
.
So
now
,
I
'll
just
count
down
with
you
once
more
,
starting
with
:
Five
.
Four
.
Three
.
Two
.
One.This
is
a
guided
mindfulness
meditation
on
making
a
fresh
start
.
There
are
times
in
all
of
our
lives
when
we
could
use
a
reset
button
.
...
A
way
to
help
ourselves
move
beyond
mental
barriers
and
move
forward
with
a
renewed
perspective
.
Starting
fresh
can
allow
us
to
approach
challenges
with
confidence
and
fearlessness
.
It
allows
us
to
see
with
clarity
,
purpose
,
and
positivity
.
Take
a
moment
to
sit
comfortably
either
cross-legged
on
the
ground
,
or
maybe
upright
in
a
chair
.
And
wherever
you
are
at
,
keep
your
shoulders
gently
pulled
back
and
your
spine
straight
.
Let
your
gaze
soften
or
allow
your
eyes
to
close
.
Take
a
few
deep
breaths
in
...
and
out
.
Allow
yourself
to
fully
relax
and
let
go
of
any
tension
in
your
body
.
As
you
breathe
gently
,
feel
the
relaxation
flow
from
your
head
...
downward
through
your
body
....
and
all
the
way
to
your
toes
.
Just
remain
alert
,
focused
,
yet
very
relaxed
.
And
continuing
to
breathe
naturally
and
comfortably
,
on
your
next
breath
,
as
you
exhale
,
imagine
that
you
are
releasing
any
negative
feelings
or
thoughts
that
are
weighing
you
down
.
This
is
a
time
to
let
go
of
the
past
and
become
fully
present
.
Embracing
what
is
right
here
...
right
now
.
Remembering
that
we
are
always
here
in
the
now
.
In
this
present
moment
.
So
,
as
you
continue
that
comfortable
and
natural
breathing
,
and
remain
focused
in
this
presence
,
Imagine
yourself
filling
up
with
a
sense
of
possibility
and
potential
.
With
each
exhale
,
let
go
of
any
doubts
or
worries
that
may
be
holding
you
back
.
Think
about
what
a
fresh
start
means
to
you
.
Maybe
it
's
a
chance
to
set
new
goals
...
To
try
something
new
....
to
challenge
yourself
...
to
let
go
of
the
past
or
to
start
fresh
in
a
new
environment
.
Whatever
it
is
,
allow
yourself
to
fully
embrace
this
opportunity
to
find
ways
to
start
fresh
.
Imagine
that
you
are
standing
at
the
edge
of
a
new
beginning
.
The
past
is
behind
you
and
the
future
is
open
and
full
of
potential
.
What
do
you
want
to
achieve
or
accomplish
?
How
do
you
want
to
feel
as
you
embark
on
this
new
journey
?
For
the
next
30
seconds
or
so
,
take
a
moment
to
visualize
what
this
fresh
start
looks
like
for
you
.
and
if
you
ca
n't
see
it
clearly
yet
,
simply
enjoy
being
here
in
the
present
and
maintaining
that
clarity
and
focus
.
Starting
that
little
bit
of
time
....
now
.
Fantastic
.
Allow
yourself
to
feel
that
sense
of
excitement
and
possibility
.
Know
that
you
have
the
power
to
create
the
life
you
want
...
and
that
a
fresh
start
is
always
possible
.
Remember
that
no
matter
what
challenges
may
come
your
way
,
You
have
the
strength
and
resilience
to
overcome
them
.
Trust
in
yourself
and
your
ability
to
create
the
life
you
desire
.
Breathe
easy
,
allowing
yourself
to
let
go
of
any
remaining
doubts
or
fears
.
Remember
that
YOU
are
in
control
of
your
journey
.
Feeling
grounded
and
energized
for
this
fresh
start
.
Thank
you
for
joining
me
today
.
I
will
now
leave
you
with
several
minutes
of
ambient
background
music
to
finish
up
for
today.Oh

does
n't
it
seem
unnecessary
what
does
it
accomplish
for
us
to
relive
these
moments
in

past
the
answer
is
often
nothing
of

it
is
always
good
to
be
conscious
of
our
mistakes
and
make
situations
right
when
we
must
but
what
we
also
must
learn
is
how
to
recognize
the
beneficial
awareness
while
discarding
the
useless
regret

anxiety
that
only
serves

make
us

bad

out

learn
to
accept
by
living

can

now

it
pertains
to
someone
who
may
have
done
you
wrong
in
the

way
as

think
about
how
your

this
presence

centeredness
to
see
a
clearer
picture
of
those
who
you
feel

wronged

on

focus

down

continuing

breathe
gently

naturally
feeling
that
flow

the
breath
in

out
each
time
what
is
true
peace
we
so
often
strive
so
hard
to
attain
these
goals
and
yet
we
rarely
ask
ourselves
how
peace
and
happiness
are
truly
represented
in
our
lives
in
the
busyness
of
life
we
tend
to
take
all
that
we
have
for
granted
and
only
focus
on
the
negatives
associated
with
what
we
want
but
do
not
have
by
taking
a
few
moments
each
day
to
focus
on
gratitude
we
can
learn
to
feel
an
appreciation
of
the
everyday
moments
all
of
the
time
this
mindfulness
will
lead
to
a
greater
sense
of
contentment
and
eliminate
restlessness
and
unnecessary
unhappiness
of
course
we
still
must
deal
with
problems
and
situations
as
they
arise
but
removing
any
unnecessary
baggage
from
our
mind
will
only
help
us
to
better
focus
on
the
problems
that
truly
need
solving
continuing
to
gently
breathe
in
and
out
focusing
on
the
movement
of
air
and
that

as

focus

the

yourself
as

maybe
when
we
are
searching
for
a
grand
meaning
and

what
we
are

doing
is
missing
what
is

you
can
be
content
and
at
peace
with
nothing
but
an
appreciation
for
what
you
already
have
returned
to
these
thoughts
or
to
this
meditation
whenever
you
need
a
reminder
contentment
and
gratitude
youThis
is
a
guided
mindfulness
meditation
on
being
thankful
every
day
.
No
matter
what
is
happening
in
life
that
we
may
qualify
as
good
or
bad
...
lucky
or
unlucky
...
one
thing
we
can
know
for
sure
is
that
we
are
here
and
able
to
experience
each
day
with
a
fresh
new
vision
each
morning
that
we
wake
up
.
This
session
will
remind
us
of
this
an
emphasize
that
having
a
thankful
and
appreciative
heart
will
allow
us
to
find
a
renewed
peace
and
stillness
within
our
minds
.
It
will
also
help
us
to
send
positive
feelings
outward
creating
an
added
grace
and
deeper
understanding
of
others
throughout
our
interactions
each
day
.
As
we
begin
,
allow
yourself
to
settle
into
a
comfortable
position
keeping
the
back
straight
and
the
spine
extended
Envision
your
body
as
being
relaxed
,
yet
alert
and
aware
not
allowing
yourself
to
slouch
or
drift
off
.
This
is
a
time
for
a
renewing
focus
of
energy
bringing
yourself
here
into
the
present
and
enjoying
the
clarity
and
openness
of
the
mind
that
it
brings
.
And
so
,
just
breathe
gently
and
naturally
just
as
you
were
before
I
drew
your
focus
to
your
breath
.
You
can
use
the
air
movement
in
and
out
of
your
nostrils
so
naturally
...
as
a
point
of
focus
.
Reminding
you
of
the
constant
cycle
of
your
breath
movement
.
Again
,
just
remain
comfortable
and
alert
.
Tuned
in
to
your
breath
.
Your
body
.
And
,
the
words
of
this
session
.
As
you
comfortably
settle
into
this
presence
,
we
will
do
a
short
countdown
.
Feel
free
to
repeat
these
short
phrases
after
me
.
Either
out
loud
or
in
your
head
,
if
you
feel
comfortable
doing
so
.

Here
and
now
Here
...
and
now
.
Wonderful
job
.
And
what
do
I
mean
by
...
becoming
the
watcher
?
Well
,
you
may
enjoy
imagining
yourself
where
you
are
within
the
space
of
your
room
.
And
when
you
become
the
watcher
,
you
see
yourself
from
another
perspective
at
another
point
in
space
.
And
as
you
visualize
yourself
within
that
space
,
you
feel
the
energy
of
your
body
and
you
can
even
imagine
a
warm
glow
start
to
form
all
around
you
as
you
watch
.
You
are
the
life
and
energy
within
this
space
.
And
that
energy
extends
out
of
the
room
...
out
into
the
sky
...
into
space
...
and
out
into
the
entire
universe
.
Continue
to
enjoy
those
thoughts
and
this
presence
keeping
that
relaxing
breath
focus
and
presence
.
Just
take
it
in
,
enjoy
it
.
Remind
yourself
that
this
is
your
time
.
Your
perfect
place
.
And
now
...
we
bring
our
attention
to
being
thankful
.
With
all
the
possibilities
that
each
day
brings
,
the
challenges
...
the
problems
...
It
can
become
easy
to
feel
out
of
balance
with
the
world
around
us
.
and
feel
as
if
we
are
a
victim
of
our
circumstances
,
however
small
.
If
we
're
not
careful
,
we
can
unconsciously
let
our
minds
drift
in
to
loops
of
negativity
.
And
yet
,
thankfulness
can
be
a
reminder
.
Waking
up
each
day
with
a
thankful
heart
can
remind
us
that
our
obstacles
are
minor
compared
to
the
knowledge
that
each
day
is
a
new
opportunity
a
renewed
purpose
.
Each
day
is
filled
with
possibility
.
Mistakes
can
be
mended
and
new
relationships
can
be
built
.
And
even
in
the
most
challenging
of
times
...
thankfulness
allows
us
to
remind
ourselves
that
we
are
strong
.
that
we
can
get
though
.
that
this
,
too
,
shall
pass
.
Being
thankful
each
day
can
lift
us
up
and
put
a
sense
of
love
into
our
hearts
.
We
become
grateful
without
the
need
to
pay
mind
to
it
.
Our
appreciation
simply
begins
to
exist
underneath
the
surface
.
An
undercurrent
of
joy
,
rather
than
anxiety
or
negativity
.
And
so
,
with
this
in
mind
...
I
invite
you
to
open
your
heart
and
mind
as
we
repeat
a
series
of
affirmations
.
I
remind
you
that
you
remain
here
in
the
now
.
In
your
comfortable
space
...
In
your
time
...
Breath
and
body
in
rhythm
.
Ready
to
welcome
these
thoughts
.
And
so
again
,
I
invite
you
to
repeat
each
affirmation
either
out
loud
or
in
your
head
,
if
you
wish
.
And
we
will
begin
...
now
.
Here
and
now
...
I
remember
to
be
thankful
.
Here
and
now
...
I
greet
each
day
with
possibility
.
Here
and
now
...
I
send
love
outward
.
With
each
day
...
A
renewed
strength
of
mind
.
With
each
day
...
A
peaceful
presence
.
With
each
day
...
A
thankful
heart
.
Great
.
Just
take
a
moment
to
reflect
on
these
ideas
.
Enjoying
this
space
...
and
enjoying
this
time
.
And
when
my
talking
ends
,
and
there
's
just
background
music
...
You
can
reflect
and
further
meditate
on
these
ideas
of
the
possibility
of
each
day
.
Sending
love
outward
remembering
your
strength
of
mind
,
your
peaceful
presence
,
and
your
thankful
heart
.
You
can
use
this
to
go
forward
into
each
and
every
day
...
allowing
you
to
wake
up
each
morning
with
that
thankful
heart
and
a
focused
mind
.
You
will
be
ready
for
positivity
and
productivity
.
Taking
in
and
enjoying
each
moment
...
even
during
challenging
times
.
Or
having
the
knowledge
that
you
have
the
strength
to
make
it
through
.
Remember
that
thankfulness
helps
us
to
see
a
clear
path
forward
and
truly
cherish
all
that
we
have
.
And
we
remember
that
waking
up
to
each
day
,
in
itself
,
is
a
blessing
and
a
chance
for
new
possibility
.
And
so
now
...
if
you
wish
to
continue
on
with
reflective
meditation
and
the
background
music
I
will
just
count
you
down
.
Starting
with

Thankful
every

the
focus
and

moment
think
back
about
if
any
of
those
phrases
hit
you
especially
deeply
it
could
be
perhaps
you
do
n't
feel
particularly
brave
or
maybe
you
are
in
the
midst
of
a
painful
time
and
are
not
sure
if
you
deserve
to
be
free
of
it
maybe
some
days
you
do
n't
feel
particularly
strong
or
brave
and
maybe
you
believe
all
of
those
things
but
you
simply
need
to
feel
them
more
deeply
for
yourself
and
so
this
time
i
ask
you
to
repeat
after
me
either
out
loud
or
just
in
your
head
whichever
suits
you
[

'll
ask
you
to

on
these
ideas
for
several
more
minutes
just
continuing
to
feel
each
idea
deeply
find
a
renewed
relationship
with
yourself
and
remember
that
you
in
this
very
moment
in
the
present
is
all
that
we
have

it

this
concludes

portion
of

thank
you
for
joining

today
[
Music

youallow
yourself
this
time
to
find
a
comforting
balance
and
centeredness
within
yourself
find
a
comfortable
spot
where
you
can
bring
focus
and
attention
for
this
time
begin
by
breathing
gently
in
and
out
as
you
start
to
take
notice
of
your
pattern
of
breathing
just
allow
your
arms
and
legs
to
release
any
tension
let
gravity
pull
them
gently
downward
continue
to
feel
that
gentle
breath
in
and
out
and
again
bring
your
focus
and
attention
to
it
your
chest
moving
up
and
down
slowly
and
comfortably
and
on
your
next
breath
as
you
breathe
out
just
let
your
limbs
relax
even
further
releasing
any
of
that
remaining
tension
during
this
time
you
may
become
especially
aware
of
your
senses
.
the
feeling
of
the
surfaces
you
're
touching
against
the
amount
of
light
in
the
room
you
may
hear
detailed
sounds
that
may
have
otherwise
gone
unnoticed
and
all
of
these
are
fine
just
allow
yourself
to
experience
these
and
accept
them
without
judgment
just
take
that
time
to
find
the
centered
feeling
of
the
present
moment
as
you
become
increasingly
aware
and
increasingly
centered
you
will
become
open
to
contemplate
our
topic
of
focus
for
today
being
the
boundless
finding
acceptance
and
being
your
best
self
What
does
it
mean
to
become
the
boundless
?
It
means
to
unlock
what
we
already
have
within
us
it
is
to
find
acceptance
within
ourself
and
with
our
surroundings
and
ultimately
it
is
to
make
way
for
our
best
self
to
shine
through
.
we
will
now
do
five
short
affirmations
or
short
phrases
which
you
can
repeat
after
me
either
out
loud
or
in
your
head
and
then
we'll
take
a
moment
of
silent
contemplation
to
reflect
let
's
try
this
now
repeating
after
me
and
allowing
yourself
to
become
more
and
more
present
here
in
this
moment
as
we
count
Five
:
I
welcome
this
moment
Four
:
I
become
present
Three
:
I
open
my
heart
and
mind
Two
:
becoming
my
best
self
One
:
becoming
the
boundless
when
we
talk
about
being
present
,
it
does
not
mean
that
we
can
not
actively
learn
from
our
past
and
future
it
means
that
we
avoid
the
unconscious
clutter
and
noise
that
fogs
our
true
path
looking
forward
actually
means
being
present
but
with
a
purpose
just
as
when
we
are
walking
we
understand
that
each
foot
is
placed
one
in
front
of
the
other
with
a
clarity
of
purpose
of
being
successful
through
that
clarity
of
mind
cutting
through
the
noise
of
our
unconscious
mind
.
And
so
,
with
these
ideas
present
we
once
again
count
using
our
affirmations
starting
now
.
Five
:
I
welcome
this
moment
Four
:
I
become
present
Three
:
I
open
my
heart
and
mind
Two

Becoming
my

self
One

Becoming
the

Great
!
Now
as
you
go
forth
embrace
these
ideas
to
anchor
yourself
in
the
present
while
learning
from
your
past
and
looking
ahead
into
the
future
with
purpose
.
you
understand
how
failure
is
a
teaching
tool
and
how
we
must
learn
from
it
yet
also
let
them
go
you
understand
how
to
embody
success
to
clarify
your
goals
and
connect
deeply
both
within
yourself
and
others
and
you
understand
what
it
means
to
be
the
boundless
to
become
your
best
self
and
lastly
going
forward
we
remind
ourselves
to
be
grateful
for
the
earth
for
good
fortune
for
good
deeds
we
take
all
of
this
with
us
as
we
move
forward
into
the
days
and
weeks
to
follow
And
so
,
counting
one
last
time
with
numbers
only
we
prepare
to
finish
this
session
and
continue
forward
with
a
powerful
new
mindset
becoming

boundless

comfortably

may

to
close
your

on
something
for
a
bit
before
you
allow
them
to
close
in
these
next
few
minutes
of
meditation
this
is

belly
gently
rise
and
fall
and
the
air
continues
to
flow
ever
so
gently
and
endowed
becoming
increasingly
present
in
this
moment
as
you
do
this
you
may
notice
a
thought
into
your
mind
perhaps
it
's
about
something
that
happened
to
you
recently
or
maybe
a
reminder
about
something
you
must
do
before
the
end
of
the
day
whenever
you
sense
one
of
these
thoughts
it
's
okay
recognize
it
but
do
n't
follow
it
any
further
once
you
gently
process
the
thought
let
your
attention
calmly
return
to
your
breathing
do
n't
get
frustrated
with
yourself
when
thoughts
keep
popping
up
in
your
mind
simply
let
them
be
as
they
are
and
continue
to
calmly
redirect
your
attention
as
you
let
yourself
become
relaxed
and
comfortable
as
you
continue
this
enjoyable
process
the
air
gently
moving
through
your
lungs
turn
your
attention
to
your
body
think
about
where
your
fingertips
are
right
now
even
if
you
do
not
move
them
you
can
sense
them
in
space
now
envision
your
toes
you
may
feel
a
slight
tingle
as
you
direct
your
attention
to
them
now
focus
on
your
eyelids
they
may
feel
heavy
relaxed
realize
how
good
it
feels
to
let
your
eyes
sit
ever
so
gently
closed
as
your
breath
continues
to
calmly
flow
in
and
out
now
the
next
time
you
take
a
breath
when
you
exhale
imagine
a
warm
wave
of
relaxation
flowing
from
the
top
of
your
head
down
to
the
tips
of
your
toes
did
you
notice
that
tingling
sensation
throughout
your
body
is
n't
it
an
amazing
sense
to
bring
to
your
own
being
without
even
a
single
movement
every
few
breaths
when
it
feels
right
to
you
try
the
same
process
slowly
exhaling
and
feeling
a
warm
gentle
wave
of
relaxation
flow
slowly
from
your
head
to
your
toes
have
you
noticed
any
tension
that
you
were
n't
previously
aware
of
maybe
you're
holding
some
in
your
shoulders
but
your
jaw
the
next
time
you
send
that
calming
wave
through
your
body
let
any
tense
muscles
just
let
go
then
relax
and
each
time
you
think
of
this
imagine
a
doubling
of
your
relaxation
as
the
wave
slowly
moves
down
your
body
you
can
do
it
you
maybe
realizing
just
how
simple
this
process
is
yet
how
greatly
it
's
calming
your
nerves
to
realize
yourself
is
the
most
profound
thing
you
can
do
yet
we
so
often
forget
to
pay
attention
but
not
now
now
is
your
time
to
be
in
the
moment
now
is
your
time
to
be
Joey
you
are
capable
of
feeling
intense
wonderful
profound
joy
right
now
you
may
feel
joy
in
thinking
about
certain
moments
in
the
past
but
there
is
no
joy
in
the
past
because
the
past
is
not
real
it
's
merely
a
memory
but
you
are
experiencing
it
in
the
present
there
is
also
no
joy
in
the
future
because
the
future
is
not
real
it
is
only
anticipation
which
can
itself
be
joy
but
you
are
experiencing
it
in
the
present
there
can
only
be
joy
in
this
moment
right
now
and
it
ca
n't
be
yours
feel
the
present
joy
that
exists
within
you
it
is
a
joy
to
breathe
take
a
breath
to
focus
on
this
thought
in
that
one
breath
say
it
to
yourself
it
is
a
joy
to
breathe
with
subsequent
breaths
repeat
these
mantras
to
yourself
I
am
alive
it
is
a
joy
to
be
alive
I
have
a
beating
heart
it
is
a
joy
to
have
a
beating
heart
I
can
feel
the
energy
in
my
body
it
is
a
joy
to
feel
this
energy
now
fill
in
more
breaths
with
your
own
joys
take
a
moment
to
think
on
it
and
then
say
them
to
yourself
in
these
next
few
moments
now
that
you
are
in
the
serene
state
let
yourself
simply
continue
to
enjoy
each
moment
as
you
continue
to
feel
the
air
slowly
move
through
your
nostrils
and
fill
your
lungs
you
let
go
of
desire
and
simply
enjoy
this
moment
here
and
now
feel
the
joy
within
you
in
the
space
you
're
in
in
the
ones
you
love
feel
the
joy
in
all
things
let
yourself
be
here
now

it
's
been
an
incredible
day
a
mixture
you
know
and
I
think
in
many
ways
that
sums
up
most
of
our
days
right
it
's
um
it
's
always
a
mixture
of
things
but
I
thought
be
a
nice
way
to
end
the
day
just
with
with
a
meditation
a
short
meditation
by
the
fire
and
whether
you
choose
to
keep
your
eyes
open
or
eyes
closed
the
thing
I
'd
really
like
you
to
focus
on
then
I
'm
gon
na
focus
on
is
the
sound
of
the
fire
so
we
're
gon
na
use
that
sound
as
our
as
our
object
of
meditation
if
that
feels
too
abstract
feels
too
strange
you
can
always
come
back
to
the
to
the
breath
but
we
're
gon
na
just
rest
our
attention
in
that
crackling
sound
with
the
fire
something
really
relaxing
about
it
there
's
nothing
to
do
the
fire
does
the
job
for
us
all
we
have
to
do
is
just
realize
when
the
minds
wandered
off
and
come
back
and
rest
in
that
crackle
of
the
fire
so
just
take
a
moment
make
sure
you
're
is
sitting
comfortably
in
join
me
for
a
little
meditation
by
the
campfire
so
once
you
're
sitting
comfortably
just
gon
na
have
the
fire
as
your
as
your
sort
of
focal
focal
point
if
you
're
watching
this
but
you
're
still
aware
of
the
space
either
side
the
rock
below
the
sky
above
but
it
's
almost
as
though
the
dancing
flames
they
they
do
n't
allow
the
mind
to
be
all
the
attention
to
be
fixed
in
one
place
the
mind
naturally
is
encouraged
to
widen
to
soften
to
relax
and
then
just
taking
a
deep
breath
in
through
the
nose
breathing
in
the
fresh
air
and
as
you
breathe
out
just
letting
go
of
the
day
do
that
again
another
couple
of
times
each
time
just
a
sense
of
letting
go
and
with
the
next
out
breath
you
can
either
gently
soften
the
focus
back
on
the
fire
or
just
gently
close
the
eyes
perhaps
a
sense
of
putting
down
any
baggage
from
the
day
is
failing
the
weight
of
the
body
I
'm
just
settling
into
that
sound
the
wind
the
flames
the
crackling
wood
maybe
you
can
hear
the
water
in
the
lake
which
is
getting
comfortable
in
this
space
now
as
you
check
in
with
the
body
this
edges
a
sense
of
leaving
behind
any
tension
from
the
day
Center
any
thoughts
being
left
behind
it
's
very
briefly
noticing
the
breath
and
then
just
settling
the
attention
the
focus
on
the
fire
you
can
do
this
is
a
visual
exercise
it
was
softening
the
focus
each
time
coming
back
to
the
dance
of
the
flames
or
you
can
use
the
sound
of
the
wind
sound
of
the
flame
crackling
of
the
wood
is
your
point
of
focus
and
the
fires
creating
the
object
of
focus
for
us
there
's
nothing
for
us
to
do
each
time
we
realized
the
minds
wondered
of
[
Music
]
as
you
focus
on
that
sound
or
on
the
image
of
the
fire
maybe
even
remembering
a
time
when
you
'd
be
next
to
a
fire
remembering
the
smell
of
the
wood
sensor
you
're
sitting
right
here
we're
sitting
right
here
together
the
sound
of
the
lake
behind
us
and
the
flames
just
constantly
moving
just
creating
that
space
in
the
mind
just
staying
without
for
a
few
moments
more
and
then
as
you
resting
that
sound
is
you
look
at
that
image
just
letting
the
mind
do
whatever
it
wants
to
do
now
just
allowing
the
mind
to
be
completely
free
maintaining
the
soft
focus
if
the
eyes
are
open
if
they
're
not
just
gently
opening
the
eyes
and
coming
back
to
as
soft
gaze
the
fire
in
front
coming
back
to
that
feeling
of
white
in
contact
at
the
body
it
's
a
surface
beneath
you
enjoying
a
sense
of
relief
having
let
go
the
body
in
the
mind
I
'm
going
to
bed
hopefully
feeling
a
little
more
rested
a
little
more
at
ease
and
whenever
you
're
ready
just
blinking
a
few
times
just
refocusing
the
eyes
going
back
to
fire
I
throw
the
space
around
you
and
thank
you
for
joining
me
by
the
campfire
tonight
it
's
I
feel
like
in
just
in
a
few
minutes
that
we
've
been
sat
here
through
somehow
transitioned
from
daytime
in
tonight
it
's
a
good
way
to
end
the
day
[
Music
]
this
is
a
brief
guided
mindfulness
meditation
on
living
each
day
as
i
often
suggest
in
these
sessions
find
a
comfortable
position
to
sit
or
lay
[
Music
]
keeping
alert
and
present
just
focusing
on
the
sound
of
my
voice
[
Music
]
and
taking
gentle
natural
breaths
focusing
on
that
airflow
in
and
out
how
are
you
are
you
tired
stressed
relaxed
anxious
whatever
you
feel
right
now
it
is
okay
allow
yourself
to
feel
it
and
not
run
from
it
just
settle
in
and
continue
those
natural
comfortable
breaths
keep
that
focus
on
the
sound
of
my
voice
and
continue
to
allow
yourself
to
give
in
to
the
present
moment
right
now
you
have
no
regrets
about
the
past
and
no
worries
about
the
future
[
Music
]
just
right
here
right
now
hearing
the
words
i
am
sharing
with
you
breathing
in
and
out
present
mindful
relaxed
what
does
it
mean
to
say
live
each
day
i
think
it
means
to
open
your
heart
and
mind
to
the
possibility
of
each
day
every
time
you
wake
up
and
catching
yourself
at
various
moments
throughout
each
day
when
you
stray
away
from
that
peace
and
joy
within
the
present
moment
allowing
your
minds
to
fight
through
the
daily
distractions
there
will
be
times
in
our
lives
where
there
will
be
difficulties
and
challenges
of
course
and
living
each
day
does
not
mean
that
you
must
force
yourself
to
feel
a
certain
way
you
can
and
may
be
sad
about
a
loss
or
about
something
larger
going
on
in
the
world
[
Music
]
but
the
process
of
living
each
day
[
Music
]
means
to
seek
something
deeper
a
calm
stillness
deep
within
you
[
Music
]
like
a
comforting
home
that
you
can
seek
out
once
you
weather
each
storm
we
ca
n't
always
avoid
sadness
or
pain
or
loss
or
problems
but
you
can
make
the
conscious
choice
to
keep
that
place
of
peace
within
you
always
there
underneath
and
you
can
leave
the
door
open
to
embrace
it
a
place
of
stillness
and
peace
always
there
deep
within
you
[
Music
]
with
this
in
mind
we
will
do
a
short
series
of
affirmation
statements
followed
by
the
calming
ambient
music
for
a
while
longer

to
repeat

youThis
is
a
brief
meditation
on
embracing
the
day
.
You
can
use
this
at
the
start
of
your
day
,
or
as
a
reminder
at
any
time
throughout
your
day
.
I
will
speak
for
a
bit
then
we
'll
let
the
ambient
music
slowly
bring
you
back
into
the
day
at
whatever
point
you
wish
.
Each
day
is
a
new
beginning
,
each
day
is
a
reminder
of
renewal
.
Each
day
is
a
gift
and
opportunity
to
be
a
more
fully
present
person
.
Make
yourself
comfortable
.
You
could
choose
to
sit
on
the
ground
or
upright
in
a
chair
or
even
standing
if
you
like
ensure
that
your
back
is
straight
and
that
you
are
using
good
yet
relaxed
posture
.
If
you
like
,
gently
shake
out
your
shoulders
and
arms
as
you
settle
in
bring
your
attention
to
your
breathing
.
It
is
that
ever-present
reminder
of
being
here
in
the
present
moment
.
and
right
now
you
can
choose
to
continue
breathing
gently
and
naturally
but
also
if
you
like
just
take
several
bigger
deep
breaths
in
and
out
.
Feel
your
muscles
relax
...
Your
body
releasing
tension
...
Just
enjoying
this
breath
focus
.
And
,
as
you
return
to
natural
breathing
focus
,
you
may
also
choose
to
roll
your
shoulders
a
bit
.
or
tilt
your
head
to
one
side
and
the
other
.
Of
course
,
always
do
what
feels
comfortable
and
does
n't
strain
your
body
.
now
that
we
are
settled
into
a
state
of
calming
presence
I
invite
you
to
continue
your
breath
focus
,
and
deeply
hear
these
reminders
for
your
day
,
whether
you
're
at
the
start
of
your
day
,
or
somewhere
in
the
middle
...
Each
day
is
a
new
beginning
.
Each
day
is
a
reminder
of
renewal
.
Each
day
is
a
gift
and
opportunity
to
be
a
more
fully
present
person
.
Any
regrets
from
the
past
...
You
can
allow
them
to
melt
away
...
like
flowing
colors
leaving
your
body
.
And
worries
about
the
future
if
those
thoughts
are
not
fully
necessary
,
let
them
melt
away
.
Let
those
colors
flow
,
And
your
energy
right
here
in
this
place
of
presence
...
is
like
you
are
a
glowing
orb
full
of
strength
possibility
locked
into
focus
Today
,
and
in
the
days
ahead
...
You
will
be
especially
compassionate
toward
others
and
especially
aware
of
how
you
communicate
with
anyone
you
encounter
.
you
will
be
a
light
upon
someone
else
's
day
in
your
daily
interactions
you
will
be
assertive
yet
measured
you
will
know
the
right
thing
to
say
or
do
in
most
any
given
situation
And
continuing
to
breathe
gently
...
Continuing
to
stay
focused
here
in
the
present
...
I
suggest
to
you
that
you
will
show
yourself
kindness
in
the
same
way
that
you
will
show
it
to
others
.
Mistakes
may
happen
,
but
you
will
focus
on
how
you
recover
from
them
,
and
not
focus
on
the
mistake
itself
.
You
will
believe
in
your
potential
.
You
will
be
patient
in
reaching
your
goals
,
but
confident
in
your
ability
to
move
closer
to
them
.
Embrace
the
day
.
Embrace
yourself
!

as

practice
this
you

a
heightened
sense
of
awareness
[

like
a

tingling
in

and
you
may
want
to
imagine

glow
around
it
as
you
feel
a
sense
of
yourself
in

be
a

experience
to
understand
yourself
as

an

piece
of

whole
removing
the
separation
of
the

in

the
state
of
presence

can
recognize
just
how
easily
we
can
access
this
part
of
our
experience
at
any
time
peace
calm
and
presence
is
always
available
for
us
to
unlock
and
as
we
recognize
this
we
also
realize
that
our
outside
causes
of
stress
and
anxiety
are
natural
and
normal
but
a
place
of
peace
and
calm
within
our
minds
is
also
natural
and
accessible
as
we
recognize
this
and
allow
ourselves
this
time
in

share
these
affirmations
with
me

can
imagine
yourself
floating
weightless
in

free
of

this
is
a
meditation
on
controlling
negative
thoughts
we
all
have
times
throughout
each
day
that
our
minds
are
invaded
with
negativity
whether
these
thoughts
are
very
upfront
or
very
deep
in
our
subconscious
we
might
feel
negatively
about
small
things
like
a
task
that
's
hanging
over
our
heads
or
larger
things
like
a
major
life
problem
there
are
fears
about
the
future
or
even
the
state
of
our
world
with
all
of
the
potential
for
stress
and
worry
in
our
lives
it
's
no
wonder
that
these
negative
thoughts
and
emotions
can
creep
in
this
session
will
seek
to
control
those
intrusive
thoughts
and
bring
about
a
clear
and
balanced
positive
outlook
on
dealing
with
our
daily
tasks
and
seeing
a
clearer
picture
of
our
lives
overall
you
should
not
attempt
to
push
away
and
avoid
our
problems
but
instead
see
them
with
a
direct
focus
in
order
to
deal
with
them
free
of
burden
and
over
analysis
[
Music
]
to
begin
find
a
comfortable
position
wherever
you
are
whether
you
're
seated
in
a
chair
on
the
floor
just
be
sure
to
find
a
position
that
allows
you
to
open
up
your
chest
and
breathe
deeply
and
comfortably
always
make
sure
that
you're
able
to
remain
fully
aware
without
drifting
off
to
sleep
and
yet
always
remain
relaxed
and
at
ease
you
may
choose
to
focus
on
a
point
in
the
room
at
first
or
gently
let
your
eyes
close
begin
to
consider
the
rhythm
of
your
breathing
as
you
breathe
in
now
just
continue
to
let
it
flow
naturally
and
just
as
you
were
before
your
attention
turn
to
it
allow
yourself
to
feel
your
chest
and
lungs
gently
rise
and
fall
with
each
cycle
the
air
moving
in
and
out
of
your
nostrils
[
Music
]
and
as
you
continue
to
do
this
also
just
bring
your
attention
to
your
surroundings
evaluate
what
you
sense
around
you
but
remain
free
of
any
judgement
simply
observe
even
if
your
eyes
are
closed
is
it
bright
or
dark
in
the
room
are
there
any
extraneous
noises
the
surface
that
your
body
is
up
against
hard
or
soft
do
you
have
any
aches
or
pains
in
your
body
where
do
you
feel
those
other
any
sensations
that
are
especially
enjoyable
are
comfortable
at
the
moment
and
again
as
you
breathe
comfortably
and
feel
your
chest
rise
and
fall
you
are
simply
bringing
awareness
to
this
present
moment
as
you
focus
your
mental
energy
we
realize
this
moment
is
really
all
that
exists
when
a
moment
is
passed
this
is
no
longer
real
and
although
we
do
all
we
can
to
predict
the
future
that
is
also
not
real
but
just
a
projection
in
our
anticipation
in
these
moments
of
focus
we
can
bring
more
clarity
to
the
realization
of
the
realness
of
the
here
and
now
allow
this
truth
to
sink
deeply
within
you
continuing
to
breathe
gently
in
and
out
aware
your
sensations
and
surrounding
focused
and
present
now

so
slowly
and
gently
count
these
five
short
phrases

that
we
so
often

down
just

do

to
be

that

recognize

not
bad

wrong
for

i
'm
glad
you
are
joining
me
today
for
this
guided
mindfulness
meditation
on
loneliness
and
feeling
alone
[
Music

as
we
begin
this
session
find
a
comfortable
seated
position
where
you
can
gradually
let
go
of
the
tightness
and
all
the
muscles
throughout
your
body
allow
yourself
to
breathe
naturally
and
comfortably
and
begin
settling
into
a
state
of
relaxed
and
present
awareness
[
Music
]
in
this
meditation
session
we
will
focus
on
finding
a
deep
sense
of
peace
within
ourselves
even
when
we
may
be
missing
a
person
group
of
people
or
a
pet
who
we
wish
was
there
to
be
with
us
and
provide
comfort
in
our
most
vulnerable
times
[
Music

it
is
also
possible
to
feel
lonely
and
isolated
even
when
there
are
many
people
in
our
lives
or
we
may
be
missing
someone
who
we
've
lost
in
either
the
recent
or
distant
past
meditating
on
this
will
help
us
to
recognize
that
feelings
of
loneliness
is
a
natural
occurrence
but
if
we
practice
mindfulness
it
will
help
us
to
be
more
present
and
at
peace
in
each
moment
better
able
to
cope
with
whatever
situation
we
find
ourselves
in
[
Music
]
as
you
continue
to
get
settled
in
keep
your
attention
on
your
natural
breathing
[
Music
]
gently
in
and
out
[
Music
]
and
now
that
you
are
here
in
this
place
of
presence
remain
loose
and
relaxed
throughout
your
entire
body
focused
and
present
in
mind
as
you
hear
my
words
[
Music
]
i
ask
you
to
imagine
a
place
or
an
event
from
the
past
this
could
be
from
your
childhood
or
recent
memory
it
might
be
an
activity
with
friends
or
family
maybe
a
memory
from
a
special
moment
in
your
life
it
might
be
from
somewhere
with
a
pet
or
just
a
favorite
place
to
get
away
and
let
your
mind
drift
off
and
instead
if
you
like
you
can
also
create
your
own
imagined
place
maybe
a
relaxing
beachfront
or
a
forest
path
or
floating
in
the
clouds
or
among
the
stars
in
space
bright
warm
serene
visualize
the
space
and
if
you
like
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
out
let
your
mind
deeply
transport
you
to
this
place
visualize
what
is
happening
all
around
you
[
Music

allow
yourself
to
feel
even
more
relaxed
than
you
were
even
just
a
few
moments
ago
and
now
i
'll
ask
you
to
do
one
more
deep
breath
in
this
calming
space
in
and
out
[

and
as
you
are
here
perfectly
content
in
this
space
in
need
of
nothing
more
[

we
will
just
take
one
minute

great
by
keeping
this
place
of
peace
in
your
mind
remember
that
you
can
transport
yourself
back
here
at
any
time
whenever
you
might
be
feeling
isolated
or
lacking
a
connection
with
people
as
a
reminder
meditation
alone
will
not
completely
fill
our
need
for
human
connection
but
it
can
bring
us
reassurance
and
peace
in
the
moments
when
we
need
it
and
may
not
have
someone
to
immediately
turn
to
we
can
clear
our
mind
relax
our
bodies
and
then
decide
and
find
the
next
steps
to
seeking
companionship
love
and
connection
as
we
finish
today
's
session
i
will
leave
you
with
five
short
phrases
i
encourage
you
to
use
these
even
write
them
down
and
keep
them
handy
when
you
do
short
meditations
throughout
your
day
and
visualize
your
imagined
place
you
can
do
this
anytime
so
feel
free
to
repeat
these
five
short
phrases
after
me
if
you
wish

youGreetings
.
Namaste
friends
.
I
’
m
glad
to
be
with
you
.
There
was
a
cartoon
that
came
out
right
after
Christmas
.
The
caption
is
“
Tree
trauma
”
and
you
see
this
very
disturbed
Christmas
tree
lying
on
the
psychiatrist
's
couch
and
the
tree
is
saying
,
“
Well
,
it
turns
out
that
all
those
gifts
weren
’
t
for
me
!
”
And
I
loved
it
.
And
I
thought
I
’
d
share
it
with
you
as
a
bit
of
a
lead
in
for
our
theme
.
We
are
going
to
be
exploring
what
’
s
called
trauma-sensitive
mindfulness
.
And
I
’
d
like
to
begin
by
saying
that
in
my
early
days
of
meditation
practice
the
uniform
mindfulness
guidance
was
“
If
something
strong
comes
up
,
be
with
it
,
”
you
know
,
“
Lean
into
the
fear
,
”
you
know
,
“
Bring
a
gentle
,
clear
,
mindful
attention
to
whatever
arises.
”
And
that
worked
pretty
well
for
me
.
But
I
found
out
later
that
for
people
that
had
a
lot
of
fear
,
had
trauma
,
it
could
amplify
the
fear
in
ways
that
sometimes
felt
overwhelming
.
And
some
people
experienced
panic
,
some
stopped
meditating
.
What
we
didn
’
t
understand
-
what
we
are
calling
“
trauma-sensitive
mindfulness
-
is
that
mindfulness
needs
to
be
adapted
with
flexibility
,
with
sensitivity
,
with
care
to
best
serve
those
that
are
living
with
PTSD
as
well
as
anyone
that
’
s
feeling
in
the
moment
potentially
overwhelming
emotions
.
So
if
after
this
talk
you
want
to
deepen
your
understanding
in
this
territory
I
’
d
like
to
encourage
you
to
read
David
Treleaven
’
s
book
“
Trauma-sensitive
therapy
”
and
it
’
s
in
my
resources
on
my
website
.
So
as
we
’
ll
discuss
for
those
with
PTSD
when
strong
fear
arises
there
may
be
times
that
it
really
isn
’
t
wise
to
lean
in
.
And
by
way
of
illustration
,
Peter
Levine
who
is
a
leader
in
responding
to
trauma
uses
the
Medusa
myth
to
illustrate
how
,
you
know
,
Medusa
is
this
monster
with
venomous
snake
hair
and
anyone
who
looks
in
her
face
will
be
immobilized
,
you
know
,
freeze
,
turn
to
stone
.
So
Perseus
who
is
the
Greek
hero
is
advised
by
Athena
–
goddess
of
wisdom
-
she
tells
him
not
to
look
directly
at
Medusa
,
to
use
his
shield
as
a
way
to
reflect
her
gaze
,
and
this
will
allow
him
to
enter
her
cave
and
slay
the
demon
.
So
the
point
being
that
sometimes
we
can
directly
face
and
contact
suffering
but
at
other
times
we
need
to
actually
shift
our
attention
and
in
the
case
of
meditation
we
need
to
find
some
ways
of
soothing
our
sympathetic
nervous
system
,
you
know
,
self-soothing
when
it
’
s
activated
,
in
other
words
we
need
to
learn
to
nurture
ourselves
.
So
we
’
re
going
to
return
to
this
.
But
I
want
to
name
that
this
talk
is
really
for
all
of
us
because
so
many
have
experienced
trauma
and
most
have
the
experience
at
times
of
being
emotionally
overwhelmed
where
it
just
feels
like
what
’
s
going
on
is
too
much
,
we
need
some
way
to
calm
ourselves
,
to
come
back
to
balance
.
So
whether
we
are
healing
PTSD
or
a
less
severe
suffering
we
are
wounded
in
relationship
,
we
need
relationship
for
healing
,
and
a
crucial
part
of
relationship
is
how
we
relate
to
our
inner
life
,
this
is
the
domain
of
meditation
.
Meditation
is
really
essential
for
all
deep
,
authentic
healing
.
And
one
of
the
last
times
I
taught
at
a
weekend
retreat
,
a
life
retreat
,
I
remember
a
woman
standing
up
in
front
of
I
think
there
were
about
three-hundred
people
and
she
said
,
“
I
’
ve
had
decades
of
PTSD
and
therapy
.
And
it
wasn
’
t
until
I
was
introduced
to
meditation
,
and
that
was
eight
years
ago
,
”
she
said
,
“
that
I
finally
found
an
inner
refuge.
”
I
’
ve
heard
this
from
so
many
people
.
And
the
key
thing
that
they
share
–
this
is
the
common
theme
–
is
that
the
very
place
of
trauma
transforms
into
the
gateway
for
spiritual
healing
;
where
the
wound
is
becomes
the
entry
.
And
some
of
you
might
remember
Lenard
Cohen
saying
,
“
In
the
broken
places
the
light
shines
through.
”
So
trauma
as
painful
as
it
is
also
is
a
place
where
we
can
reconnect
with
a
sense
of
the
sacred
,
soul
,
spirit
,
a
sense
of
a
fearless
heart
.
So
I
’
m
starting
here
on
purpose
with
what
’
s
possible
that
as
much
as
the
painful
emotions
and
when
it
’
s
extreme
-
full
trauma
-
is
something
that
we
don
’
t
wish
for
in
our
lives
.
That
intensity
really
does
become
a
domain
for
spiritual
awakening
when
we
learn
how
to
pay
attention
.
So
what
I
’
ve
seen
is
–
and
this
is
for
all
of
us
–
that
the
practice
of
mindfulness
needs
to
be
customized
.
And
we
each
have
different
bodies
and
minds
,
so
we
need
to
-
and
not
just
that
,
on
different
days
-
so
we
need
to
have
a
flexibility
with
how
we
work
with
the
instructions
we
’
re
given
.
This
is
especially
true
for
those
with
trauma
.
And
the
emphasis
needs
to
be
with
trauma
on
first
creating
enough
of
a
sense
of
safety
so
that
it
’
s
possible
to
really
have
a
full
presence
.
So
what
we
’
ll
cover
is
we
’
ll
look
at
some
of
the
background
on
the
suffering
of
trauma
,
we
’
ll
look
at
particular
strategies
that
will
help
you
customize
mindfulness
and
self-resourcing
,
and
really
the
healing
that
comes
when
we
can
then
open
to
our
wholeness
.
So
by
way
of
background
on
trauma
,
if
we
were
live
,
you
know
,
if
I
could
ask
you
and
do
a
hand
raise
,
“
How
many
of
you
either
know
trauma
personally
in
your
own
body-mind
or
know
someone
close
that
is
dealing
with
trauma
?
”
Most
everyone
would
raise
their
hand
because
trauma
is
so
widespread
and
similarly
PTSD
–
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
–
it
’
s
so
prevalent
in
our
collective
psyche
especially
admit
the
global
poli
crisis
’
s
that
we
’
re
living
through
.
The
writer
Carol
Patterson
describes
us
as
a
“
PTSD
society.
”
And
the
signs
of
a
traumatized
society
?
Disconnection
from
the
earth
,
from
our
own
bodies
,
violation
of
the
earth
,
cruelty
and
aggression
towards
fellow
beings
,
the
addiction
that
is
so
spread
through
our
whole
globe
,
polarization
and
fragmentation
,
the
breakdown
of
communication
between
parts…
These
are
all
signs
of
trauma
.
And
you
can
think
of
it
collectively
but
also
in
an
individual
body
.
And
it
feels
really
important
to
recognize
that
people
in
non-dominant
groups
face
ongoing
threats
and
conditions
that
make
them
more
vulnerable
to
experiencing
trauma
including
generational
trauma
,
just
experiencing
that
.
And
these
identities
–
non-dominant
identities
–
include
race
,
religion
,
ethnicity
,
social
class
,
sexual
orientation
,
indigenous
heritage
,
national
origin
,
gender
,
disability…
So
many
!
And
if
you
are
in
the
dominant
groups
,
it
’
s
very
hard
to
remember
and
recognize
with
those
with
different
backgrounds
and
identities
are
actually
experiencing
.
And
I
feel
like
Resmaa
Menakem
has
been
such
an
important
voice
for
me
on
this
.
And
he
uses
the
language
“
black
bodies
feel
endangered
and
potentially
traumatized
by
whites.
”
He
describes
how
through
the
centuries
and
currently
white
bodies
are
countless
times
more
violent
to
black
bodies
than
the
reverse
:
killing
,
lynching
,
raping
.
And
so
as
he
is
sharing
white
people
often
forget
how
much
trauma
is
there
.
Falkner
says
it
so
clearly
,
he
says
,
“
The
past
is
not
dead
.
It
is
not
even
past.
”
And
what
this
means
is
:
Situations
that
white
people
don
’
t
register
as
triggers
for
trauma
actually
are
.
And
I
think
of
in
my
own
life
the
meditation
class
I
used
to
teach
weekly
live
,
largely
white
attendees
,
and
it
was
located
in
a
fairly
wealthy
suburb
and
my
friends
of
color
would
come
and
report
they
felt
intensely
uncomfortable
,
many
of
them
,
anxious
,
you
know
,
and
at
first
I
couldn
’
t
get
it
,
you
know
,
it
’
s
like
“
Well
,
everybody
is
being
really
friendly
”
–
that
’
s
not
the
deal
,
I
mean
,
there
is
the
micro
aggressions
that
happen
and
there
is
that
history
of
feeling
threatened
by
white
people
,
trauma
in
the
body
.
They
’
re
The
of
course
more
obvious
situation
would
be
being
stopped
by
a
police
car
for
speeding
:
It
might
be
unpleasant
for
a
white
person
,
but
for
a
person
of
color
it
can
mean
life
or
death
.
Another
whole
domain
:
Those
with
financial
security
forget
the
trauma
of
poverty
,
that
we
are
living
through
these
pandemics
and
how
a
family
when
COVID
hits
a
family
and
you
are
unable
to
work
and
you
have
several
children
and
that
goes
on
for
a
bit
can
put
you
under
the
line
.
Not
sure
about
feeding
your
family
.
Paying
rent
.
I
think
about
those
in
the
global
north
and
,
you
know
,
we
have
some
climate
events
that
are
really
disturbing
and
still
don
’
t
quite
recognize
that
the
devastation
of
climate
change
really
is
here
now
for
many
countries
:
Pakistan
,
one
third
under
water
last
year
Filipinas
,
Bangladesh
;
and
then
I
think
of
the
droughts
and
famine
in
Africa
,
Chad
,
Kenya
,
Somalia
.
This
is
not
just
livelihood
,
it
’
s
life
.
So
I
took
a
little
time
with
that
because
there
is
such
huge
trauma
in
non-dominant
populations
and
just
to
realize
how
much
that
is
around
the
globe
can
be
staggering
to
the
mind
.
And
then
of
course
in
addition
to
the
collective
causes
of
trauma
many
if
not
all
of
us
go
through
traumatic
events
in
our
personal
life
:
in
the
womb
,
upbringing
,
accidents
,
sickness
,
surgeries
,
abuse
,
sudden
losses…
You
know
,
more
than
two
thirds
of
children
reported
at
least
one
traumatic
event
by
the
age
of
sixteen
.
So
the
difference
between
trauma
and
PTSD
–
and
this
is
simplified
–
but
trauma
arises
in
situations
where
the
nervous
system
is
overwhelmed
,
where
normal
coping
strategies
don
’
t
work
,
PTSD
arises
when
there
is
an
inability
to
process
and
integrate
that
trauma
into
the
larger
body-mind
.
So
some
people
will
have
trauma
and
process
it
and
not
have
PTSD
and
others
won
’
t
.
And
here
is
an
example
:
Let
’
s
say
someone
is
sexually
abused
as
a
young
child
and
it
happens
repeatedly
and
unpredictably
.
And
so
there
is
that
severed
belonging
,
there
is
no
safety
,
no
larger
container
,
no
trustworthy
available
adult
who
could
in
some
way
make
possible
the
healing
,
the
processing
.
So
trauma
is
living
in
the
body
,
“
The
issues
are
in
the
tissues
”
as
they
say
.
And
it
’
s
easily
triggered
.
Any
sign
of
danger
,
of
violation
,
of
abandonment
activates
acute
stress
.
And
what
happens
?
This
means
that
the
parts
of
our
brain
that
have
evolved
to
monitor
for
danger
are
over
activated
chronically
,
the
on-button
is
jammed
and
so
there
is
this
regular
secretion
of
cortisol
which
is
toxic
for
neurons
.
It
damages
connections
needed
for
parts
of
the
brain
to
communicate
so
it
’
s
easy
for
executive
function
to
get
cut
off
,
for
the
limbic
fear
to
take
over
.
I
find
a
useful
way
to
illustrate
this
is
some
of
you
may
remember
from
Dan
Siegel
where
he
says
you
know
,
this
is
your
brain
–
and
you
might
look
at
your
fist
right
now
–
this
is
your
brain
.
And
if
you
look
at
it
close
in
,
this
is
your
limbic
system
,
the
spine
goes
up
into
the
brain
stem
.
This
area
,
the
thumb
and
this
area
here
represent
the
limbic
system
and
the
brain
stem
which
is
responsible
for
the
arousal
of
fight-flight-freeze
.
And
these
four
fingers
,
this
is
the
frontal
cortex
,
this
is
executive
functioning
,
it
actually
has
the
capacity
to
send
messages
down
to
the
limbic
system
saying
,
“
It
’
s
okay
,
”
you
know
,
when
there
is
this
thread
that
comes
up
the
frontal
cortex
says
,
“
Oh
we
’
ve
experienced
this
before
,
we
’
re
going
to
be
okay.
”
But
what
happens
when
we
’
re
chronically
stressed
and
we
don
’
t
have
that
kind
of
integration
is
we
get
a
message
of
danger
and
we
flip
our
lid
.
And
when
we
flip
our
lid
there
is
a
disconnection
from
empathy
,
compassion
,
perspective
,
we
are
no
longer
functioning
with
the
parts
of
our
brain
that
give
us
resourcefulness
,
we
lose
access
to
flexibility
,
to
creativity
.
So
this
is
the
hijack
by
the
survival
brain
.
We
’
re
essentially
unsafe
.
And
it
’
s
interesting
to
consider
to
play
,
to
mate
,
to
create
,
to
nurture
our
young
,
to
nurture
others
,
to
receive
nurturing
we
have
to
feel
safe
enough
to
temporarily
turn
off
our
vigilance
,
shut
down
our
defensive
systems
,
we
can
’
t
have
a
flipped
lid
.
And
yet
how
often
are
we
partially
or
fully
having
that
flipped
lid
reaction
and
cut
off
from
those
capacities
,
caught
in
a
sense
of
being
small
,
separate
,
confused
,
disconnected
.
Even
when
we
are
not
caught
in
a
full
flipped
lid
,
we
know
what
a
partial
hijack
is
like
when
our
mind
becomes
preoccupied
and
small
and
we
’
ve
lost
our
sense
of
perspective
,
we
don
’
t
have
access
to
our
full
intelligence
,
we
make
more
mistakes
.
One
of
my
favorite
examples
is
of
a
mom
who
is
generally
into
feeding
her
children
organic
foods
and
good
vegetables
.
But
she
wasn
’
t
able
to
get
to
the
grocery
store
,
she
was
stressed
,
she
was
tired
,
and
she
is
looking
for
what
to
feed
her
children
.
And
thank
goodness
she
finds
a
frozen
pizza
in
the
freezer
.
And
she
feels
really
guilty
,
but
she
announces
,
“
Okay
,
we
’
re
having
pizza
tonight.
”
And
her
son
resists
,
he
says
,
“
I
don
’
t
want
frozen
pizza
!
”
And
she
says
very
calmly
–
tries
to
be
calm
–
“
That
’
s
what
we
’
re
having.
”
Inside
she
is
increasingly
feeling
upset
because
she
feels
like
she
is
failing
them
and
she
feels
like
a
bad
mother
.
And
her
son
is
getting
upset
,
“
I
don
’
t
want
it
!
I
don
’
t
want
a
frozen
pizza
!
”
Again
,
she
tries
to
sound
calm
,
“
It
’
s
all
we
have
in
the
house
.
You
’
ve
had
it
before.
”
And
inside
she
is
thinking
“
He
is
spoiled
!
I
failed
him
!
I
am
not
only
a
bad
mother
in
terms
of
good
dinners
,
but
I
spoiled
him
,
he
is
an
entitled
brat
!
I
am
a
bad
mom…
,
”
you
know
,
just
really
spinning
off
.
Takes
a
deep
breath
,
says
,
“
That
’
s
what
we
’
re
having
tonight
,
sweetie
.
I
’
m
tired
.
And
it
’
s
what
we
’
re
having.
”
And
he
looks
with
his
tear-streaked
voice
and
he
says
quite
calmly
,
“
Okay
,
mama
,
but
could
we
at
least
heat
it
up
?
”
We
go
into
a
trance
.
Partial
hijack
whether
it
’
s
just
a
partial
flipped
lid
or
a
full
flipped
lid
we
go
into
a
trance
.
And
as
I
mentioned
when
we
’
re
threatened
,
when
we
’
re
having
that
reactivity
whether
it
’
s
partial
or
full
flipped
lid
in
those
times
we
are
cut
off
,
we
are
not
able
to
play
,
learn
,
bond
,
take
in
or
give
love
.
And
this
,
friends
,
is
a
suffering
of
trauma
,
that
cut
off
experience
,
the
fear
and
mistrust
because
it
’
s
really
a
cut
off
of
belonging
to
our
own
being
and
to
others
and
in
a
deep
way
we
are
cut
off
from
wholeness
,
from
spirit
.
So
bringing
this
to
meditation
you
might
consider
that
when
we
are
triggered
in
an
intense
way
,
when
we
are
in
reactive
fight-flight-freeze
,
we
are
cut
off
and
outside
of
our
window
of
tolerance
,
we
are
not
able
to
tolerate
what
’
s
arising
for
us
,
and
that
term
“
window
of
tolerance
”
again
is
from
Dan
Siegel
–
psychologist
and
author
,
has
been
on
this
podcast
–
and
,
you
know
,
as
he
describes
it
when
we
are
in
the
window
of
tolerance
our
brain
is
integrated
,
but
when
we
get
triggered
and
we
flip
our
lid
we
leave
the
window
of
tolerance
,
we
’
re
either
caught
in
fight-flight
which
is
strong
,
unpleasant
emotions
and
when
the
instructions
for
mindfulness
if
we
are
in
fight
flight
are
to
feel
what
’
s
going
on
that
’
s
when
we
can
have
that
sense
of
overwhelm
.
Or
we
are
in
freeze
-
kind
of
rigidity
,
a
dissociation
-
still
outside
the
window
of
tolerance
-
numbing
,
can
’
t
feel
things
-
and
often
the
instructions
for
mindfulness
are
“
Feel
what
’
s
going
on
inside
your
body
”
and
yet
there
is
a
sense
of
being
cut
off
.
So
here
is
the
thing
:
The
classical
instructions
for
meditation
tell
us
to
feel
our
feelings
and
when
we
are
in
fight-flight-freeze
we
are
either
feeling
them
too
much
-
it
feels
overwhelming
-
or
unable
to
feel
them
.
And
either
way
there
is
a
sense
of
in
some
way
not
being
able
to
feel
the
meditation
,
failing
the
meditation
.
And
when
we
are
outside
the
window
we
are
really
cut
off
,
we
are
unable
to
.
So
I
’
d
like
to
take
some
moments
now
to
look
at
the
primary
suffering
that
happens
when
we
’
re
triggered
either
into
dissociation
or
triggered
into
that
hyper-sensitivity
and
strong
emotion
.
And
the
primary
suffering
is
shame
,
shame
about
what
’
s
going
on
.
And
I
’
d
like
to
share
with
you
a
story
some
of
you
might
remember
that
I
felt
really
illustrated
the
power
of
traumatic
experience
and
the
shame
that
can
surround
it
and
how
we
can
work
with
that
.
So
many
years
ago
,
I
was
working
with
this
woman
who
was
sexually
and
physically
abused
by
her
father
.
And
as
an
adult
she
had
an
eating
disorder
,
she
wasn
’
t
capable
of
intimate
relationships
,
and
she
would
swing
–as
I
’
ve
described
-
between
being
dissociated
from
her
feelings
to
being
flooded
.
And
she
hated
herself
.
She
hated
herself
when
she
was
shut
down
,
she
hated
herself
when
she
was
filled
with
fear
,
she
hated
herself
for
her
body
and
for
her
eating
disorder
,
she
considered
herself
damaged
goods
and
hated
herself
for
who
she
was
.
This
is
shame
.
And
she
did
a
good
deal
of
therapy
and
also
was
working
with
meditation
and
we
were
customizing
it
.
And
out
of
one
intense
and
deep
therapy
session
she
wrote
a
story
about
her
own
healing
.
And
in
it
she
was
seven
years
old
,
hiding
in
a
closet
,
terrified
after
an
unexpected
attack
by
her
drunk
and
enraged
father
.
And
the
little
girl
in
story
is
praying
,
she
is
saying
,
“
Help
,
I
can
’
t
take
it
anymore.
”
And
she
opens
her
eyes
and
sees
a
fairy
in
a
haze
of
blue
with
a
glittering
wand
.
And
she
lets
the
fairy
know
how
her
father
has
been
beating
her
and
her
mother
doesn
’
t
help
and
how
she
feels
like
they
both
wish
she
was
dead
.
And
the
fairy
listens
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
then
tells
her
that
while
she
can
’
t
make
all
this
pain
and
fear
disappear
,
she
can
help
her
get
through
this
time
,
she
can
help
her
forget
and
then
remember
later
when
she
is
able
to
handle
it
.
And
with
the
wave
of
the
wand
the
good
fairy
says
,
“
I
’
m
going
to
send
things
into
different
parts
of
your
body
.
And
they
’
re
going
to
hold
them
for
you
until
you
feel
strong
enough
to
let
them
move
freely
again.
”
And
she
explains
that
she
is
going
to
help
the
little
girl
tighten
and
dull
her
pelvis
and
her
belly
and
she
is
going
to
constrict
her
heart
and
throat
and
protect
her
from
feeling
the
raw
intensity
of
the
hurt
and
the
fear
and
the
broken-heartedness
.
And
I
’
ll
read
you
the
last
part
of
the
story
.
This
is
the
fairy
speaking
.
“
’
You
’
ll
have
trouble
feeling
and
being
close
to
people
,
but
it
’
ll
be
your
way
of
surviving
.
At
those
times
that
the
pain
irrupts
you
’
ll
find
your
own
ways
to
control
it
,
ways
that
may
not
look
good
to
the
world
but
will
be
of
temporary
comfort
.
And
you
my
darling
will
be
a
fairly
functional
human
being
in
spite
of
all
this
because
you
have
a
strong
mind
and
you
can
hold
this
all
in
and
I
’
ll
be
helping
you.
’
The
child
looked
directly
into
the
fairy
’
s
eyes
and
asked
,
‘
How
will
you
help
?
Will
you
come
back
to
see
me
?
’
‘
You
will
not
forget
everything
.
I
will
leave
a
voice
inside
you
that
will
urge
you
to
reconnect
with
your
whole
self
.
It
may
be
a
very
long
process
but
in
time
you
’
ll
feel
an
urgent
calling
to
step
out
of
imprisoning
beliefs
,
to
unwind
your
body
and
release
what
’
s
been
holding
all
these
years
.
You
’
ll
learn
the
art
of
sacred
presence
.
There
will
be
physical
and
emotional
pain
as
you
open
but
you
’
ll
have
what
you
need
-
the
compassion
and
wisdom
,
the
support
of
loving
others
–
to
be
a
whole
person
,
spiritually
awake
but
still
the
same
.
This
is
because
your
soul
has
always
been
there
just
hidden
by
the
scars
of
this
lifetime.
’
The
good
fairy
put
the
arm
around
the
child
’
s
shoulders
and
gently
lead
her
into
her
bed
.
She
waved
her
wand
and
stood
by
as
the
little
girl
finally
relaxed
into
a
deep
sleep
.
She
gazed
tenderly
at
the
small
,
innocent
face
and
then
whispered
her
goodbye
,
‘
When
you
wake
up
you
’
ll
forget
that
I
was
here
.
You
’
ll
forget
you
asked
for
help
.
You
’
ll
forget
the
sharpness
of
your
daily
pain
.
This
is
the
only
way
I
know
to
get
you
through
this
.
You
are
a
beautiful
child
.
I
love
you
.
And
in
fact
your
parents
love
you
although
they
are
incapable
of
showing
it
to
you
.
You
’
ll
have
to
love
yourself
enough
to
heal
so
that
when
you
’
re
older
your
life
will
be
powerful
,
full
and
free
.
One
day
you
will
know
who
you
really
are
.
You
’
ll
trust
your
goodness
and
know
your
belonging
.
Until
then
and
for
always
I
love
you.
’
”
So
I
shared
her
story
in
a
talk
I
gave
–
of
course
she
gave
me
permission
–
and
after
that
talk
so
many
lined
up
to
talk
to
me
.
And
their
sharings
were
very
similar
.
One
person
put
it
so
clearly
,
she
said
,
“
I
’
ve
always
been
so
ashamed
of
the
addiction
,
of
the
conflictual
relationships
,
the
rage
,
shutting
down
and
listening
to
this
I
realized
it
wasn
’
t
my
fault
but
I
was
trying
to
control
the
trauma
.
I
didn
’
t
have
a
better
way.
”
And
she
said
again
,
“
I
didn
’
t
have
a
better
way.
”
And
it
was
that
sense
of
relief
,
this
glimmering
of
self-forgiveness
.
And
so
many
had
something
similar
that
if
they
could
just
get
that
it
was
the
best
they
could
do
at
the
time
,
there
was
some
sense
of
hope
and
possibility
.
But
they
needed
to
forgive
themselves
first
.
I
remember
in
a
similar
way
a
man
I
worked
with
a
few
years
ago
.
Company
downsized
and
he
got
laid
off
and
he
tried
for
a
few
years
just
tried
everything
to
get
a
job
and
he
couldn
’
t
and
he
descended
into
this
panic
,
depression
,
sleeplessness
,
you
know
,
he
was
taking
anxiety
medication
and
he
more
and
more
withdrew
from
other
people
,
really
avoided
other
people
,
and
his
marriage
was
falling
apart
,
he
was
really
filled
with
shame
.
And
I
remember
working
with
him
and
finally
at
some
point
saying
,
“
This
is
trauma
.
And
it
’
s
not
your
fault.
”
And
something
cracked
open
.
He
started
weeping
.
It
was
the
beginning
of
some
self-compassion
,
the
beginning
of
healing
.
And
he
gradually
reached
out
to
friends
,
he
joined
a
men
’
s
group
,
he
started
reengaging
,
he
was
on
a
path
of
healing
.
Trauma
is
a
universal
response
to
endangerment
-
when
we
are
powerless
-
as
are
the
symptoms
of
PTSD
when
trauma
hasn
’
t
been
processed
.
It
’
s
universal
.
And
what
starts
to
release
the
shame
is
a
kind
of
cellular
realizing
“
It
’
s
not
my
fault
,
”
it
’
s
not
our
fault
that
we
get
traumatized
,
it
’
s
not
our
fault
when
we
’
re
unable
to
process
the
trauma
,
it
’
s
not
our
fault
that
our
nervous
system
reacts
with
anxiety
,
with
depression
,
it
’
s
not
our
fault
that
then
there
are
the
behaviors
aimed
at
controlling
pain
,
coping
strategies
.
And
this
was
the
realization
the
woman
who
wrote
that
story
about
the
fairy
–
that
it
was
intelligent
to
shut
down
feelings
when
they
were
too
much
to
handle
–
and
the
coping
strategies
that
followed
were
her
way
of
eating
,
her
way
of
controlling
her
body
experience
,
avoiding
intimacy
,
it
was
the
best
she
could
do
.
So
I
’
m
spending
some
time
with
this
because
where
there
is
trauma
there
is
shame
that
’
s
asking
our
attention
and
healing
.
And
I
extend
this
and
say
:
With
any
deep
emotional
wounding
–
neglect
,
criticism
,
be
trail
,
rejection
–
somewhere
deep
down
we
feel
it
’
s
our
fault
and
we
’
re
ashamed
of
the
way
the
wounding
affects
our
personality
and
behaviors
,
we
think
we
should
be
different
.
If
you
can
recognize
this
shame
and
dedicate
to
releasing
it
–
“
It
’
s
not
my
fault
”
–
it
’
s
possible
to
then
bring
healing
directly
to
the
place
of
trauma
-
to
woundedness
-
and
begin
to
open
.
Let
’
s
pause
here
and
reflect
for
a
moment
.
You
might
consider
where
you
might
be
living
with
generational
trauma
or
with
early
trauma
,
wounds
from
a
lack
of
good
nurturing
-
in
other
words
poor
attachment
–
bonding
,
you
know
,
where
might
you
have
some
experience
of
trauma
,
where
have
you
been
outside
the
window
of
tolerance
and
then
had
to
develop
coping
strategies
to
work
with
what
’
s
going
on
inside
you
–
maybe
dissociating
from
the
body
,
maybe
anger
,
addictive
behaviors
,
avoidance
of
real
intimacy
,
neediness
,
co-dependency
.
So
just
check
and
see
where
that
might
be
in
your
life
,
how
it
’
s
presented
.
Trauma
and
then
the
reaction
to
trauma
.
And
as
you
do
honestly
check
and
sense
:
Have
you
felt
shame
about
woundedness
?
Have
you
felt
shame
about
the
ways
you
have
tried
to
protect
yourself
from
feeling
too
much
?
And
as
you
explore
this
you
might
put
your
hand
on
your
heart
and
just
be
aware
of
what
’
s
going
on
inside
,
the
places
of
self-judgment
or
shame
,
and
let
some
of
the
places
of
judgment
come
right
to
the
foreground
.
And
as
they
do
you
might
explore
what
happens
when
you
say
with
kindness
,
“
It
’
s
not
my
fault.
”
And
if
it
helps
you
might
imagine
someone
you
trust
our
love
be
the
one
to
say
it
,
“
It
’
s
not
your
fault.
”
I
invite
you
to
hear
it
,
to
let
it
in
,
and
if
it
’
s
hard
to
let
it
in
this
message
pray
to
let
it
in
.
Again
from
the
fairy
story
,
“
’
You
’
ll
have
to
love
yourself
enough
to
heal
so
that
when
you
’
re
older
your
life
will
be
powerful
,
full
and
free
.
One
day
you
will
know
who
you
really
are
.
You
will
trust
your
goodness
and
now
your
belonging
.
Until
then
and
for
always
I
love
you.
’
”
If
your
eyes
are
closed
,
you
might
open
them
.
In
many
shamanistic
cultures
the
process
of
reconnecting
–
of
releasing
the
shame
and
processing
the
trauma
–
it
’
s
called
soul
retrieval
.
And
it
’
s
believed
that
when
a
person
is
traumatized
the
soul
leaves
the
body
as
a
way
of
protecting
it
from
intolerable
pain
.
And
in
the
process
of
soul
retrieval
the
traumatized
person
is
held
in
a
love
and
safety
of
community
as
the
soul
is
invited
to
return
.
I
like
this
description
because
I
’
ve
heard
many
who
heal
from
trauma
describe
recovering
a
sense
of
soul
,
of
spirit
,
recovering
a
sense
of
the
dimensions
of
sacred
that
live
through
them
and
had
been
cut
off
.
And
likewise
in
other
healing
contexts
the
care…
just
in
this
one
it
’
s
the
community
–
the
care
of
therapists
,
friends
,
teacher
might
initially
provide
the
safety
to
reconnect
with
some
degree
of
authentic
presence
and
well-being
inside
.
We
need
it
.
I
always
think
of
that
little
story
of
it
’
s
a
stormy
night
and
a
child
calls
out
for
his
parents
because
he
is
scared
of
the
thunder
.
And
the
father
goes
in
and
he
says
,
“
It
’
s
okay
.
You
can
trust
that
God
is
with
you.
”
And
he
is
with
the
child
a
little
and
then
he
leaves
the
room
and
then
the
child
starts
whaling
again
and
the
father
comes
back
and
again
reassures
him
,
you
know
,
“
God
is
with
you.
”
And
he
leaves
the
room
.
And
finally
the
child
is
crying
and
he
comes
back
in
and
the
child
says
,
“
You
know
,
I
know
God
is
with
me
but
I
want
someone
with
skin
on.
”
So
I
love
that
because
we
need
the
interpersonal
,
we
need
the
relational
support
in
healing
from
trauma
,
from
that
cut
off
feeling
.
And
as
we
’
ve
been
talking
we
also
have
a
relationship
with
our
inner
life
.
And
that
’
s
what
we
’
re
cultivating
.
I
so
often
think
of
psychologist
Luis
Cozolino
who
says
,
“
It
’
s
not
survival
of
the
fittest
,
it
’
s
survival
of
the
nurtured.
”
So
this
last
part
of
what
we
’
re
exploring
is
how
the
self-nurturing
that
comes
with
some
facets
of
meditation
is
exactly
what
we
need
,
exactly
what
we
need
in
this
process
of
healing
trauma
.
And
we
need
enough
access
to
safety
and
care
to
be
able
to
open
mindfully
.
And
partly
we
build
that
in
a
daily
meditation
that
we
adapt
in
a
way
that
allows
us
to
really
feel
safe
enough
.
There
are
many
instructions
that
get
offered
and
we
think
“
Oh
well
,
meditating
means
I
have
to
close
my
eyes.
”
You
can
customize
any
part
of
the
instructions
.
Find
out
for
yourself
in
your
daily
practice
if
it
is
better
to
have
your
eyes
open
or
closed
.
The
posture
:
It
’
s
always
assumed
we
are
sitting
but
you
could
be
lying
down
or
standing
.
For
some
with
PTSD
movement
really
helps
because
sitting
still
is
difficult
,
too
scary
.
You
can
spend
some
time
and
sense
:
What
is
the
anchor
that
really
serves
you
?
It
might
not
be
the
breath
because
breath
is
sometimes
difficult
for
people
who
have
PTSD
.
Find
an
anchor
–
maybe
it
’
s
sound
,
certain
parts
of
the
body
that
either
are
neutral
or
positive
in
sensation
,
begin
by
grounding
yourself
,
feel
the
earth
beneath
you
.
I
have
a
PDF
that
is
available
on
how
to
customize
your
daily
meditation
if
you
have
PTSD
and
it
’
s
on
the
homepage
on
my
website
and
that
can
give
you
more
guidance
in
this
.
So
let
’
s
look
at
what
happens
when
distressing
or
strong
emotions
start
taking
over
.
What
then
?
And
just
to
remind
you
that
while
you
might
have
enough
tolerance
to
face
or
lean
in
,
it
’
s
very
wise
and
compassionate
to
recognize
when
you
don
’
t
,
that
this
might
be
a
time
like
Perseus
to
not
face
directly
and
instead
to
emphasize
self-nurturing
.
Once
you
are
back
in
your
window
of
tolerance
,
you
can
then
return
to
a
more
direct
contact
filled
with
mindfulness
.
Okay
,
so
how
do
we
self-nurture
?
The
training
is
to
pre-identify
a
way
of
self-resourcing
that
you
can
then
call
on
when
you
are
distressed
.
And
there
are
many
types
.
You
could
be
sending
a
message
to
yourself
that
comforts
and
soothes
you
,
all
types
of
messages
.
You
could
visualize
someone
you
love
-
imagine
they
are
either
hugging
you
or
giving
you
a
message
of
comfort
-
,
you
can
visualize
a
safe
space
–
place
you
’
ve
been
to
or
a
place
in
your
imagination
-
,
you
can
gently
touch
your
heart
as
I
often
teach
.
All
of
these
if
they
are
familiar
to
you
,
you
might
recognize
them
as
part
of
the
N
of
RAIN
,
Nurture
.
And
so
the
training
is
to
practice
this
self-nurturing
with
these
resources
when
you
are
not
activated
,
when
you
’
re
feeling
okay
,
as
part
of
your
daily
meditation
perhaps
so
that
the
pathway
to
the
window
of
tolerance
is
more
available
when
you
do
get
triggered
,
so
that
you
’
re
more
able
to
remember
the
pathway
back
to
your
inner
resourcefulness
.
I
was
working
with
a
woman
in
DC
–
a
Latina
woman
who
is
very
active
in
immigration
and
serving
the
local
community
doing
social
justice
work
and
so
on
–
and
she
had
a
lot
of
childhood
trauma
and
was
also
regularly
around
people
who
were
traumatized
including
in
her
extended
family
and
those
who
she
works
with
.
And
she
found
that
when
she
was
activated
,
she
couldn
’
t
calm
herself
with
self-compassion
,
she
couldn
’
t
put
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
give
herself
a
message
,
she
felt
too
regressed
,
too
damaged
,
too
flawed
.
So
her
pathway
–
what
she
discovered
would
work
–
was
she
brought
to
mind
her
grandmother
who
was
very
strong
and
empowered
,
kind
of
a
spiritual
matriarch
in
the
family
;
and
brought
also
to
mind
other
women
in
the
family
;
but
her
grandmother
was
the
key
one
.
And
she
imagined
her
grandmother
saying
to
her
,
“
I
’
m
here
with
you
,
you
can
trust
your
heart
,
it
’
s
okay
”
and
just
kind
of
touching
her
cheek
.
Once
she
identified
this
–
just
bringing
to
mind
an
image
of
her
grandmother
and
that
touch
and
that
message
–
that
became
a
central
part
of
her
daily
practice
.
Every
day
she
would
invoke
that
sense
and
feel
the
experience
of
that
comforting
presence
.
And
if
you
’
re
doing
this
,
it
really
helps
to
start
your
daily
meditation
with
self-nurturing
,
to
end
it
,
to
use
it
as
often
as
it
’
s
possible
because
repetition
makes
a
difference
.
In
neuroscience
it
’
s
described
as
“
entraining
and
installing.
”
What
’
s
happening
is
there
is
old
pathways
in
the
brain
that
you
’
ve
been
repeating
over
and
over
again
that
are
anxious
pathways
,
worry
pathways
,
fear
pathways
and
you
’
re
creating
new
pathways
;
and
the
more
you
repeat
them
–
the
pathways
to
self-nurturing
–
the
more
access
you
’
ll
have
.
Once
that
is
there
,
once
that
resource
is
strong
,
you
can
do
what
’
s
called
“
pendulating
”
and
that
means
you
can
go
from
feeling
that
resourceful
place
to
dipping
in
a
bit
to
where
the
fear
lives
.
And
each
time
the
fear
feels
a
little
too
strong
you
come
back
to
the
place
of
feeling
resourced
.
And
gradually
what
happens
is
by
bringing
some
of
the
qualities
of
feeling
resourced
to
that
wounded
place
it
begins
to
get
processed
.
This
is
what
it
means
to
process
,
to
digest
or
heal
trauma
.
It
’
s
to
be
able
to
bring
an
increased
sense
of
presence
and
care
to
a
place
inside
you
,
in
your
body
,
feeling
it
where
you
’
ve
been
storing
the
trauma
.
Just
to
kind
of
loop
back
to
the
fairy
story
.
This
was
the
process
this
woman
did
.
She
would
call
on
that
sense
of
the
good
fairy
and
feel
her
presence
and
feel
herself
held
and
really
nurtured
and
safe
in
that
presence
.
And
then
she
’
d
go
to
the
parts
of
the
body
that
had
really
stored
the
trauma
.
And
there
were
stories
with
them
and
very
strong
feelings
.
Bit
by
bit
over
many
months
.
And
she
found
that
as
she
did
that
she
started
experiencing
this
growing
freedom
,
this
capacity
to
,
you
know
,
actually
be
with
other
people
in
a
more
intimate
way
,
her
eating
disorder
lightened
.
Similarly
,
with
this
other
woman
that
I
just
brought
up
–
bringing
her
grandmother
,
feeling
her
grandmother
’
s
presence
–
she
was
able
to
very
quickly
come
back
into
that
window
of
tolerance
.
The
fears
would
still
come
up
but
she
knew
how
to
pause
,
how
to
breathe
,
how
to
bring
that
image
to
her
mind
and
how
to
find
her
way
back
to
that
more
integrated
place
.
So
I
want
to
step
back
here
friends
and
say
:
This
is
an
archetypal
process
that
like
Perseus
we
first
need
to
redirect
our
attention
and
find
–
in
this
case
I
am
describing
the
kind
of
self-nurturing
that
increases
our
sense
of
safety
–
and
then
once
we
are
back
inside
the
window
of
tolerance
–
we
are
not
overwhelmed
–
then
we
can
begin
to
open
to
old
wounds
.
So
what
I
’
d
like
to
do
is
close
with
a
practice
.
And
this
is
a
guided
meditation
that
offers
a
pathway
to
our
own
inner
resources
in
the
face
of
intense
emotion
.
I
’
d
like
to
invite
you
to
find
a
comfortable
posture
,
whatever
position
allows
you
to
feel
most
safe
and
present
.
If
it
helps
to
begin
to
collect
your
attention
with
a
few
full
breaths
.
Feel
the
earth
beneath
you
,
the
weight
of
your
body
,
sense
of
contact
right
here
.
Your
eyes
could
be
open
or
closed
.
And
now
scan
and
see
who
in
your
life
brings
you
comfort
,
brings
you
a
sense
of
love
and
safety
.
It
might
be
a
grandparent
,
child
,
friend
,
healer
,
pet
–
could
be
living
or
not
-
,
could
be
an
ancestor
or
perhaps
a
spiritual
figure
you
haven
’
t
personally
met
,
deity
,
divine
mother
,
Buddha
,
Allah
,
Jesus
.
In
other
words
:
Sense
who
helps
you
to
feel
the
type
of
love
or
safety
that
you
want
to
access
when
things
are
difficult
.
So
take
some
moments
to
imagine
and
visualize
that
person
or
being
.
You
might
imagine
their
eyes
looking
at
you
with
an
expression
of
care
.
And
sense
the
love
,
the
energy
surrounding
you
when
you
bring
that
being
to
mind
.
And
you
might
attune
to
what
words
of
wisdom
from
this
being
-
from
this
presence
-
what
reminder
might
most
comfort
the
fearful
part
inside
you
.
What
does
that
part
most
need
to
remember
,
to
trust
?
Sense
this
message
being
offered
and
what
is
it
like
in
your
body
and
in
your
heart
when
you
let
the
love
and
wisdom
of
a
caring
being
in
?
And
if
it
’
s
hard
to
let
it
in
just
let
that
be
your
sincere
prayer
:
“
May
I
let
in
this
care
.
May
I
let
in
the
messages
of
truth.
”
And
you
can
even
visualize
the
loving
bathing
you
,
bathing
the
cells
inside
you
.
So
it
’
s
surrounding
you
and
permeating
you
.
And
see
if
you
can
sense
that
felt
experience
of
being
safe
and
loved
,
a
belonging
to
something
larger
,
a
larger
source
,
resting
in
that
.
Okay
,
now
shifting
your
attention
,
please
bring
to
mind
a
situation
that
you
know
can
evoke
fear
in
you
,
not
trauma
but
some
level
of
fear
.
It
might
be
something
that
arises
in
a
relationship
with
somebody
,
it
could
be
a
situation
–
maybe
a
social
kind
of
setting
that
scares
you
-
,
something
related
to
work
,
financial
security
,
your
own
or
another
’
s
health
.
And
let
the
situation
be
close
in
so
you
can
actually
sense
it
like
you
’
re
watching
a
movie
,
play
it
out
to
get
a
taste
of
the
fear
that
it
evokes
so
you
’
re
noticing
where
you
are
,
the
look
on
other
people
’
s
faces
,
whatever
is
going
on
,
the
words
that
are
exchanged
,
fearful
thoughts
or
beliefs
.
And
let
’
s
just
sense
where
the
fear
lives
in
you
,
what
it
’
s
like
,
how
you
experience
it
.
And
then
in
a
very
intentional
way
you
might
take
a
full
breath
and
intend
to
resource
yourself
,
intend
self-nurturing
.
And
you
might
begin
by
grounding
.
Just
feel
yourself
sitting
right
here
.
Feel
the
weight
of
your
bottom
on
the
seat
,
the
warmth
of
your
feet
on
the
floor
,
the
gravity
that
pulls
you
to
this
beloved
planet
,
our
larger
body
right
here
.
And
again
imagine
that
comforting
being
.
Look
at
the
image
and
the
felt
sense
of
that
being
and
sense
close
in
eyes
that
are
caring
,
hear
the
words
that
are
comforting
,
and
feel
yourself
held
by
,
cared
by
belonging
to
a
larger
source
.
And
you
can
now
bring
these
resources
with
you
–
this
sense
of
this
loving
being
–
as
you
touch
into
the
fear
just
a
bit
knowing
that
you
can
touch
and
then
return
to
a
safe
space
,
you
can
touch
in
,
sense
the
fear
,
and
feel
the
support
of
that
space
of
care
,
of
nurturing
.
And
if
at
any
point
the
fear
feels
like
too
much
,
go
back
and
again
re-imagine
and
strengthen
and
vitalize
this
connection
with
this
being
and
with
the
sense
of
being
held
and
loved
.
So
over
the
next
few
moments
just
sense
that
back
and
forth
–
the
loving
resource
space
and
then
touching
in
,
feeling
where
the
fear
lives
in
a
very
visceral
way
in
your
body
and
then
back
to
the
fullness
of
self-nurturing
,
of
the
resource
.
And
as
you
’
re
doing
this
it
might
help
to
slow
your
breathing
down
a
bit
–
long
,
slow
in-breath
,
long
,
slow
out-breath
.
Be
aware
of
your
relationship
with
fear
in
these
moments
,
increasingly
perhaps
the
possibility
of
inhabiting
a
sea
of
loving
presence
and
including
the
currants
of
fear
,
resting
in
that
vat
sea
of
loving
,
in
the
heart-space
that
has
room
for
fear
.
This
is
the
true
meaning
of
a
fearless
heart
.
For
the
last
few
moments
,
be
the
sea
of
loving
and
include
the
currants
that
are
here
with
tenderness
,
and
clarity
,
and
presence
.
And
gently
bringing
yourself
back
.
If
your
eyes
are
closed
opening
them
.
A
few
full
breaths
.
So
Rumi
points
to
the
same
truth
that
we
’
ve
been
exploring
really
through
these
two
segments
on
awakening
and
healing
through
trauma
.
And
his
words
are
this
,
that
“
The
wound
is
the
place
where
light
enters
you.
”
What
if
you
really
trusted
that
?
What
if
where
there
is
woundedness
you
sense
a
real
interest
or
curiosity
:
How
can
I
deepen
this
self-nurturing
?
How
can
I
bring
a
presence
that
’
s
truly
healing
to
this
place
of
woundedness
?
Unprocessed
wounds
can
either
fester
in
shame
or
we
can
dedicate
ourselves
to
loving
ourselves
into
healing
,
letting
the
wounds
become
a
portal
for
true
awakening
,
for
freedom
.
So
we
’
ll

Sending
you
much
love.so
wherever
you
are
right
now
i
'd
just
like
you
to
just
take
a
moment
to
get
comfortable
it
does
n't
matter
whether
you're
parked
in
a
stationary
car
sat
on
a
train
somewhere
maybe
you've
just
arrived
home
maybe
you
have
n't
left
work
yet
whatever
it
is
wherever
you
are
just
taking
a
moment
to
sit
comfortably
do
n't
have
to
be
fully
upright
but
at
least
that
in
a
position
which
will
allow
you
to
find
that
balance
of
focus
relaxation
sense
of
ease
in
both
the
body
and
the
mind
and
as
you
sit
there
just
take
a
couple
of
nice
big
deep
breaths
breathing
in
through
the
nose
and
out
through
the
mouth
as
you
breathe
in
through
the
nose
sense
of
taking
in
fresh
air
the
lungs
expanding
the
body
expanding
as
you
breathe
out
a
sense
of
letting
go
letting
go
of
whatever
has
been
going
on
for
you
today
feeling
the
muscles
in
the
body
soften
as
the
body
exhales
just
a
couple
more
times
taking
deep
breaths
in
through
the
nose
and
out
through
the
mouth
and
the
next
time
you
breathe
out
if
it
feels
more
comfortable
[
Music
]
if
you
're
in
a
place
where
it
's
easy
and
safe
to
do
so
you
can
just
gently
close
your
eyes
and
as
you
sit
there
just
enjoy
that
initial
sense
of
having
just
put
everything
down
having
left
everything
behind
and
just
that
feeling
of
being
present
again
noticing
the
sensation
of
the
body
pressing
down
against
the
the
seat
the
chair
beneath
you
it
's
that
feeling
being
grounded
to
feet
on
the
floor
hands
and
the
arms
on
the
legs
and
as
you
sit
there
just
taking
a
moment
without
opening
the
eyes
to
just
notice
the
environment
around
you
as
well
maybe
it
's
the
sounds
different
smells
maybe
it
's
movement
maybe
it
's
stillness
maybe
it
's
the
temperature
maybe
it
's
the
wind
if
you
're
outside
but
with
the
eyes
closed
just
becoming
more
familiar
with
the
space
around
you
and
as
you
sit
there
starting
to
notice
how
the
body
feels
so
very
often
as
we
go
through
the
day
we
accumulate
tension
just
noticing
if
there
are
any
obvious
areas
of
tension
in
the
body
not
doing
anything
to
them
they
they'll
unwind
on
their
own
if
we
approach
them
in
the
right
way
but
just
noticing
how
the
body
feels
allowing
any
tension
to
come
to
the
surface
knowing
that
's
a
good
thing
allowing
any
tiredness
any
feeling
of
heaviness
to
come
to
the
surface
knowing
that
's
a
good
thing
so
in
letting
go
now
at
this
stage
we
give
the
body
and
the
mind
space
to
be
more
alert
more
awake
after
the
exercise
i
'm
just
starting
to
notice
the
the
breath
now
as
well
the
breath
is
also
a
good
indication
of
how
we
're
feeling
in
both
body
and
mind
and
without
trying
to
change
the
breath
in
any
way
just
noticing
whether
the
breaths
are
long
short
deep
or
shallow
you
can
just
gently
place
your
hand
on
your
stomach
if
you
find
that
more
comfortable
easier
to
feel
that
movement
and
again
even
though
thoughts
may
still
continue
to
pop
in
perhaps
about
what
's
happened
during
the
day
where
you
've
just
come
from
or
maybe
even
jumping
ahead
to
what
's
to
come
each
time
you
see
the
mind
wander
off
just
letting
go
of
that
and
coming
back
to
the
present
that
feeling
that
sensation
the
movement
of
the
breath
and
then
mentally
now
i
'm
just
going
to
imagine
that
the
body
the
mind
is
taking
a
shower
that
any
tension
is
being
left
behind
just
like
you
to
imagine
a
warm
ray
of
sunlight
just
shining
down
onto
the
body
you
can
imagine
that
it
shines
down
on
your
back
your
chest
on
top
of
your
head
whatever
feels
comfortable
and
it
's
as
though
it
begins
in
one
place
but
it
expands
outward
in
every
direction
and
as
it
does
so
it
just
melts
away
any
tension
you
can
even
kind
of
work
systematically
down
through
the
body
just
watching
feeling
any
tension
melt
away
mentally
we
leave
those
thoughts
behind
physically
we
let
go
of
whatever
's
accumulated
during
the
day
it
expands
outward
in
every
direction
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
our
fingers
toes
so
it
's
as
though
the
entire
body
is
not
really
separate
anymore
from
that
idea
of
sunlight
there
's
just
a
sense
of
ease
warmth
sense
of
having
reset
both
the
body
and
the
mind
for
whatever
is
coming
up
next
and
in
your
own
time
when
you
're
ready
you
can
just
gently
open
your
eyes
again
youThis
is
a
loving-kindness
meditation
.
It
will
focus
on
compassion
.
This
means
compassion
toward
those
around
us
...
and
reflecting
the
same
compassion
for
ourselves
.
And
it
even
means
directing
love
and
compassion
outward
.
To
the
earth
...
to
the
sky
...
to
the
sun
and
universe
.
It
will
help
us
to
appreciate
and
understand
the
weight
of
each
day
of
life
that
we
receive
.
A
free
and
harmonious
life
.
It
will
help
with
the
ability
to
embrace
and
understand
what
is
within
our
control
...
And
to
let
go
of
that
which
is
not
.
As
always
,
find
a
favorite
comfortable
position
.
Begin
to
recognize
your
body
.
Any
areas
of
tension
,
letting
your
muscles
begin
to
relax
.
And
as
you
do
,
bring
that
attention
to
your
breath
.
Just
notice
it
.
Gently
and
naturally
.
In
and
out
.
You
can
use
the
air
moving
in
and
out
of
your
nostrils
as
a
point
of
focus
.
You
can
also
notice
that
gentle
movement
of
your
chest
as
the
air
flows
in
and
out
of
your
lungs
.
If
it
is
helpful
,
you
can
say
to
yourself
the
words
``
in
and
out
''
on
each
breath
.
Even
just
in
your
head
.
Again
,
just
as
naturally
as
you
always
breathe
,
but
bringing
your
attention
to
it
.
And
with
each
breath
,
letting
all
your
muscles
relax
just
a
bit
more
.
And
then
,
a
bit
more
again
.
Breath
by
breath
.
And
as
you
are
here
in
this
comforting
place
,
If
distracting
thoughts
try
to
creep
their
way
into
your
mind
,
It
is
fine
.
You
can
always
recognize
them
and
just
let
them
drift
away
.
Just
bringing
your
attention
back
to
breath
and
body
.
And
,
to
my
suggestions
.
Again
and
again
.
Recognizing
a
small
victory
each
time
you
notice
a
stray
thought
,
and
gently
send
it
away
.
And
so
now
,
as
you
just
gently
continue
that
breath
and
body
focus
...
I
will
share
with
you
some
excerpts
from
Buddhist
discourse
on
loving-kindness
.
While
I
do
so
,
you
can
just
continue
to
relax
,
focus
your
thoughts
,
and
take
these
words
in
.
Feeling
them
deeply
as
you
remember
your
breath
and
body
.
``
May
all
beings
be
happy
and
secure
''
''
May
they
be
happy-minded
''
''
May
we
not
wish
anger
,
no
ill-will
or
suffering
of
others
''
''
May
all
beings
,
without
exception
,
be
happy-minded
''
''
Just
as
a
parent
would
protect
a
child
,
cultivate
a
boundless
heart
toward
all
beings
''
''
Keep
a
strong
mind
,
free
of
enmity
and
negativity
''
''
Let
the
thoughts
of
boundless
loving-kindness
,
in
one
true
direction
,
pervade
the
whole
world
.
''
As
we
settle
into
these
thoughts
,
we
understand
the
universal
nature
of
their
themes
.
We
see
life
and
the
world
as
it
could
be
,
and
we
recognize
that
we
are
just
one
grain
of
that
greater
whole
.
And
yet
,
have
the
ability
to
move
mountains
with
the
strength
of
our
outward
love
.
Our
resolve
toward
the
betterment
of
humanity
.
And
so
now
,
we
will
move
into
affirmations
to
bolster
these
themes
of
loving-kindness
.
And
so
if
you
like
,
just
repeat
each
short
affirmation
phrase
after
me
in
whatever
way
you
see
fit
.
Either
out
loud
,
or
in
your
head
.
And
I
will
leave
just
a
moment
to
process
each
one
.
Just
a
reminder
to
continue
to
focus
on
your
gentle
and
natural
breath
,
in
and
out
.
And
body
...
loose
and
relaxed
muscles
.
Here
in
your
comfortable
space
.
We
begin
now
.
May
my
life
be
filled
with
happiness
.
May
I
be
well
in
body
and
mind
.
May
I
give
openly
and
freely
.
May
I
be
filled
with
grace
and
compassion
.
Awesome
.
And
now
in
this
perfect
place
that
we
have
built
,
We
will
now
send
these
affirmations
outward
to
all
beings
,
And
even
to
the
earth
,
sky
,
and
universe
.
Embrace
and
become
one
with
all
that
is
good
around
you
And
feel
that
healing
freedom
that
it
brings
.
Feeling
grateful
and
remembering
our
breath
and
our
body
.
We
say
once
more
:
May
all
our
lives
be
filled
with
happiness
.
May
we
all
be
well
in
body
and
mind
.
May
we
all
give
openly
and
freely
.
May
our
minds
stay
at
ease
through
times
of
challenge
.
May
all
the
world
be
filled
with
grace
and
compassion
.
Great
.
Go
forth
with
confidence
and
pride
.
As
a
compassionate
person
,
you
can
know
that
your
kindness
will
be
put
forth
into
the
world
,
and
passed
along
through
everyone
you
encounter
.
Lao
Tsu
said
:
``
Kindness
in
words
creates
confidence
.
''
``
Kindness
in
thinking
creates
profoundness
.
''
``
Kindness
in
giving
creates
love
.
''
Let
us
lastly
reinforce
these
ideas
of
loving-kindness
by
once
again
remembering
the
lines
from
the
Buddhist
texts
:
May
all
beings
be
happy
and
secure
.
Cultivating
a
boundless
heart
toward
all
beings
.
A
strong
mind
,
free
of
negativity
.
Let
thoughts
of
loving-kindness
pervade
the
whole
world
.
So
now
the
music
will
continue
for
just
a
bit
and
we
will
finish
this
session
and
just
count
from
5
to
1
.
Starting
now

1.Good
morning
.
This
is
a
brief
session
to
help
you
kickstart
your
day
with
a
motivated
,
yet
clear
and
focused
mind
as
an
essential
part
of
your
morning
routine
.
Let
's
get
started
.
Find
a
meditation
position
that
works
well
for
you
.
For
this
session
,
avoid
laying
down
and
instead
,
try
sitting
on
the
floor
or
on
the
front
edge
of
a
chair
.
Keep
your
spine
straight
and
shoulders
comfortably
back
.
Staying
relaxed
yet
alert
.
Feel
free
to
roll
your
shoulders
back
a
few
times
or
tilt
your
neck
back
and
forth
to
loosen
up
.
And
as
you
find
your
spot
,
take
comfortable
breaths
,
naturally
in
and
out
.
Not
forcing
anything
,
but
bringing
your
attention
to
it
.
Feeling
the
air
moving
in
and
out
of
your
nostrils
.
And
moving
your
chest
up
and
down
.
If
you
like
,
add
in
a
deeper
breath
every
little
while
,
just
to
cleanse
and
refresh
your
whole
body
.
Deeply
in
and
out
.
And
now
,
as
you
are
settling
into
this
place
of
presence
and
energy
,
we
will
focus
on
going
into
the
day
with
a
clear
mind
.
As
a
part
of
your
morning
routine
,
it
is
a
great
time
to
declutter
your
mind
.
Through
this
process
,
you
will
be
mindful
of
your
own
self-care
.
Keeping
hold
of
feelings
of
love
toward
yourself
.
This
will
ultimately
exude
love
and
care
outward
to
others
that
you
encounter
during
your
day
.
And
so
,
just
listen
to
each
following
suggestion
.
And
as
you
do
,
on
the
next
breath
you
take
in
and
out
,
just
deeply
focus
on
that
suggestion
,
as
we
begin
now
.
I
see
the
clutter
in
my
mind
.
I
let
the
thoughts
float
away
.
Making
clear
and
open
space
.
Beautiful
,
cleansed
,
and
free
.
Letting
go
of
what
thoughts
remain
.
Falling
away
like
a
waterfall
.
Then
calm
,
still
,
and
clear
.
A
focused
mind
,
a
free
mind
.
Fantastic
job
.
We
will
perform
this
brief
exercise
once
more
.
And
this
time
,
feel
it
twice
as
deeply
.
Twice
as
clearly
.
Knowing
that
you
only
have
a
bit
of
clutter
yet
to
clear
.
We
'll
start
again
now
.
And
remember
,
just
a
breath
in
and
out
to
bring
focus
to
it
.
I
see
the
remaining
clutter
in
my
mind
.
I
let
the
thoughts
float
away
.
Making
clear
and
open
space
.
Beautiful
,
cleansed
,
and
free
.
Letting
go
completely
.
Falling
away
like
a
waterfall
.
Then
calm
,
still
,
clear
.
A
focused
mind
,
a
free
mind
.
Okay
.
Remember
these
key
phrases
throughout
your
day
.
And
when
an
intrusive
and
non-helpful
thought
tries
to
force
its
way
into
your
thought
patterns
,
you
can
be
reminded
of
your
reassuring
breath
.
Just
as
you
have
a
clear
mind
now
,
you
can
let
that
thought
drop
away
.
At
any
point
in
your
day
,
you
can
return
to
a
calm
,
clear
,
focused
,
and
free
mind
.
Welcome
to
your
day
.
Embrace
it
.
Enjoy
it
.
Love
it
.

do
so
,
you
can
also
recognize
and
embrace
that
sense
of
positivity
.
A
feeling
of
forward
momentum
.
To
help
with
this
,
I
will
count
down
from
five
to
one
,
and
will
give
some
short
phrases
.
These
are
reminders
that
you
can
use
throughout
each
day
.
So
feel
free
to
repeat
after
me
either
out
loud
or
in
your
head
,
Starting
now
:
Five
:
''
Embracing
the
energy
of
life
.
''
Four
:
''
Enjoying
this
moment
.
''
Three
:
''
Finding
the
energy
within
me
.
''
Two
:
''
Being
a
positive
force
.
''
One
:
''
Out
into
the
world
.
''
And
just
once
more
,
I
will
repeat
''
Being
a
positive
force
out
into
the
world
.
''
Wonderful
.
Deeply
feel
this
simple
yet
powerful
message
within
you
.
Your
body
and
mind
acting
as
one
.
Right
now
,
take
just
a
minute
of
comfortable
silence
to
reflect
on
these
ideas
and
feel
them
everywhere
.
Not
in
just
your
mind
but
throughout
your
entire
body
,
and
even
in
the
aura
around
you
.
Peace
,
positivity
,
energy
,
love
.
Reflect
on
this
now
.
Great
.
And
now
,
if
you
like
,
just
allow
a
deep
rejuvenating
breath
or
two
.
Just
deeply
in
,
and
out
,
and
in
,
and
out
.
You
can
do
more
at
your
own
pace
if
you
like
.
And
when
you
like
,
return
once
again
to
that
calming
and
relaxing
state
of
presence
and
natural
breath
.
And
as
you
are
feeling
so
at
peace
yet
motivated
for
whatever
next
steps
are
ahead
of
you
,
we
will
embrace
that
energy
,
embrace
that
forward
momentum
,
and
we
'll
count
once
more
.
First
with
our
phrases
,
and
then
,
as
we
ready
ourselves
to
finish
this
session
,
just
with
numbers
.
Reflecting
and
feeling
this
again
,
deeply
within
and
around
us
.
Starting
now
.
Five
:
''
Embracing
the
energy
of
life
.
''
Four
:
''
Enjoying
this
moment
.
''
Three
:
''
Finding
the
energy
within
me
.
''
Two
:
''
Being
a
positive
force
.
''
One
:
''
Out
into
the
world
.
''
Keep
this
forward
momentum
,
spread
it
by
means
of
your
centeredness
,
your
calm
,
your
goodness
.
And
still
feel
the
fire
of
motivation
and
energy
within
you
.
You
can
remind
yourself
at
any
time
.
There
is
no
limit
to
your
positivity
and
goodness
.
There
's
no
limit
to
your
possibility
.
And
so
,
we
prepare
to
finish
our
session
today
with
this
last
countdown
.
And
we
'll
start
it
with
:
Five
.
Four
.
Three
.
Two
.
One.You
are
invited
to
take
this
time
to
center
yourself
,
improve
your
connection
with
yourself
,
and
,
if
necessary
,
forgive
yourself
.
You
are
worthy
.
To
get
us
started
,
find
a
position
that
is
comfortable
for
you
for
this
session
.
It
could
be
seated
in
a
chair
with
hands
resting
on
your
legs
,
or
cross-legged
on
a
pillow
or
bed
.
Begin
to
prepare
your
body
by
relaxing
your
muscles
,
yet
remembering
to
remain
focused
and
present
throughout
our
time
.
Relax
your
jaw
,
your
shoulders
,
your
arms
.
Bring
that
relaxing
energy
down
through
your
body
,
into
your
legs
.
All
the
way
down
out
the
tips
of
your
toes
.
Just
relaxing
every
muscle
a
bit
more
.
And
as
you
do
,
begin
to
focus
on
your
breath
.
Just
letting
it
move
in
and
out
.
Just
as
naturally
as
you
had
been
breathing
before
you
were
thinking
about
it
.
Notice
that
gentle
chest
movement
,
the
airflow
in
and
out
of
your
nostrils
.
Just
so
comfortable
and
present
.
Continuing
to
relax
,
bring
yourself
further
and
further
into
this
present
moment
,
and
become
ready
to
hear
the
words
of
today
's
session
.
Each
day
presents
us
with
many
challenges
,
and
through
all
of
it
,
we
are
often
the
harshest
critics
of
ourselves
.
Our
minds
can
lead
us
down
paths
of
unnecessary
stress
and
dissatisfaction
.
It
can
become
a
weight
and
a
burden
on
us
.
A
heaviness
pressing
us
slowly
down
.
But
the
wonderful
part
of
this
process
is
that
we
are
capable
of
reminding
ourselves
that
we
are
worthy
.
We
are
worthy
of
peace
.
Worthy
of
a
still
mind
.
Worthy
of
self-love
.
We
can
let
go
of
the
mental
baggage
so
that
we
can
freely
deal
with
the
challenges
that
are
truly
in
front
of
us
.
And
throughout
this
process
forgiving
ourselves
for
mistakes
and
recognizing
how
to
improve
as
we
move
forward
.
Always
looking
forward
.
So
as
you
continue
to
get
settled
in
,
take
one
or
two
deep
and
comfortable
breaths
,
if
you
like
.
Feeling
your
chest
fill
and
release
.
Relaxing
more
and
more
each
time
,
but
also
remembering
to
stay
present
.
Try
this
for
several
cycles
,
if
it
feels
comfortable
.
Those
deep
breaths
in
and
out
.
And
slowly
allow
your
breath
just
to
settle
into
a
natural
pattern
,
but
always
keeping
your
attention
on
that
continual
flow
:
in
and
out
.
You
can
use
this
time
to
remind
yourself
of
the
constant
cycle
of
life
.
Your
breath
,
your
heartbeat
,
your
blood
flow
.
All
the
tiny
miraculous
processes
that
make
it
possible
for
you
to
be
here
in
this
space
.
Feeling
the
sensations
of
the
room
.
You
are
focused
and
present
,
yet
still
relaxed
.
Just
enjoying
each
moment
here
and
now
.
So
now
,
I
invite
you
to
take
one
minute
to
silently
remind
yourself
to
remain
centered
and
enjoy
this
calm
and
peace
.
Remembering
that
this
,
right
now
,
is
your
time
.
Remembering
that
you
are
worthy
of
this
.
Recognizing
each
breath
in
and
out
,
we
start
now
.
Great
.
And
now
,
I
invite
you
to
bring
focus
to
this
idea
of
self-worth
by
repeating
a
few
of
these
short
affirmations
.
You
can
say
them
out
loud
or
in
your
head
.
Just
slowly
repeating
them
after
me
or
just
listening
to
them
.
Starting
now
:
''
I
am
worthy
.
''
``
I
am
worthy
of
love
.
''
``
I
am
worthy
of
being
forgiven
.
''
``
I
am
worthy
of
joy
.
''
``
I
am
worthy
of
peace
.
''
``
I
am
worthy
of
stillness
.
''
``
I
am
worthy
.
''
Excellent
.
And
so
,
now
,
as
you
are
here
in
this
calm
,
focused
,
and
present
space
,
we
can
remind
ourselves
that
negativity
,
doubt
,
belittling
self-thought
:
all
of
this
is
not
useful
or
beneficial
to
our
self-improvement
.
By
keeping
a
daily
awareness
of
our
thoughts
,
we
can
recognize
these
intrusive
thoughts
.
Catch
them
as
they
happen
.
And
then
,
with
the
next
gentle
breath
outward
,
can
just
allow
them
to
float
away
and
give
no
time
or
energy
to
them
.
Through
this
process
,
we
recognize
our
worth
and
then
become
free
to
pursue
our
real
challenges
.
Our
goals
and
our
aspirations
.
And
so
,
now
,
I
share
with
you
a
few
last
affirmations
that
I
once
again
invite
you
to
repeat
after
me
,
if
you
so
choose
.
Beginning
now
:
''
With
this
next
breath
,
I
release
negativity
.
''
``
With
this
next
breath
,
I
embrace
this
moment
.
''
``
With
this
next
breath
,
I
see
my
worth
.
''
``
With
this
next
breath
,
I
am
at
peace
.
''
Fantastic
job
.
You
are
capable
of
being
at
peace
.
You
are
capable
of
being
connected
to
each
and
every
moment
.
Remember
this
as
you
go
forth
into
each
day
,
each
hour
,
each
breath
.
So
now
,
if
you
like
,
spend
a
few
more
minutes
here
in
this
place
of
peace
and
presence
.
As
you
reflect
on
them
,
allow
yourself
to
feel
them
twice
as
deeply
,
twice
as
true
.
Let
these
ideas
comfort
you
twice
as
much
.
And
know
that
you
are
worthy
of
being
forgiven
.
You
are
worthy
of
joy
.
You
are
worthy
of
peace
.
You
are
worthy
of
stillness
of
the
mind
.
You
are
worthy
.

hi
and
welcome
to
the
Himalayas
we
're
in
the
Himalayas
we
are
just
at
the
road
from
the
monastery
where
I
ordained
as
a
Tibetan
Buddhist
monk
so
we
're
in
northern
India
we
're
in
the
de
Langella
mountain
range
and
we
're
a
little
bit
below
the
snow
line
and
we
know
an
incredibly
beautiful
forest
by
day
this
forest
is
magic
by
night
's
terrifying
it
's
leopards
as
monkeys
the
whole
thing
but
by
day
is
very
peaceful
and
the
Sun
sort
of
just
comes
in
through
the
trees
and
create
a
very
particular
atmosphere
and
there
's
a
very
particular
smell
in
the
forest
as
well
you
just
create
a
very
particular
atmosphere
and
the
sounds
as
if
you
can
hear
a
tea
right
now
there
's
today
actually
is
Tibet
a
new
year
it
's
it's
Losar
so
you
might
hear
some
some
music
and
some
celebrations
in
in
the
background
you
might
hear
the
stream
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottom
of
the
hillside
here
and
there
's
a
pretty
good
chance
of
during
the
meditation
today
you
're
gon
na
hear
a
lot
of
sounds
of
different
birds
as
well
so
it
's
a
really
magical
place
is
a
place
that
means
a
huge
amount
to
me
personally
and
a
place
where
I
really
wanted
to
bring
you
so
that
we
could
have
meditate
together
so
find
a
spot
get
comfortable
and
we
'll
begin
[
Applause
]
so
just
take
a
moment
to
settle
into
the
forest
here
I
'm
gon
na
start
with
our
eyes
open
looking
out
towards
the
mountainside
the
snow-capped
peaks
in
the
distance
and
the
trees
all
around
and
just
maintaining
that
very
soft
focus
has
taken
a
cup
a
nice
big
deep
breath
breathing
in
through
the
nose
and
out
through
me
[
Applause
]
there
's
your
breathing
just
imagining
your
breathing
in
that
fresh
mountain
air
as
you
breathe
out
just
letting
go
of
any
tension
in
the
body
well
them
all
just
one
more
time
breathing
in
through
the
nose
and
that's
for
the
man
and
throughout
this
meditation
you
can
either
have
your
eyes
open
eyes
closed
whatever
feels
most
comfortable
but
either
way
just
take
a
moment
just
to
enjoy
the
view
the
sounds
just
enjoying
that
feeling
of
having
taken
some
time
out
for
yourself
and
just
feel
the
weight
of
the
body
the
price
is
down
notice
how
the
body
feels
today
when
your
game
just
take
a
moment
mr.
SEF
into
the
sounds
whether
it
's
a
stream
the
birds
the
dogs
or
any
of
the
different
sounds
here
in
the
forest
today
[
Applause
]
I
'm
just
bringing
the
attention
back
to
the
body
again
starting
at
the
top
of
that
just
gently
scanning
down
I
'm
just
noticing
in
a
bit
more
detail
now
if
it
was
comfortable
or
feels
uncomfortable
[
Applause
]
stepping
out
with
a
thinking
mind
being
more
aware
that
physical
sensations
[
Applause
]
and
as
you
scan
down
through
the
body
is
slowly
becoming
more
we
're
at
the
breath
[
Applause
]
noticing
where
in
the
body
we
feel
that
movement
[
Applause
]
so
it
's
throughout
the
meditation
we
have
a
choice
we
can
come
back
to
the
breath
each
time
or
we
can
come
back
to
the
sounds
of
the
forest
[
Applause
]
so
knowing
the
minds
gon
na
get
distracted
in
that
moment
we
realize
the
distraction
just
bringing
the
attention
back
to
the
sounds
or
the
breath
[
Applause
]
we
're
choosing
now
rather
to
focus
on
the
breath
well
the
sound
was
just
resting
the
attention
there
nothing
to
do
[
Applause
]
allowing
any
tools
to
come
and
go
[
Applause
]
you
're
focused
on
the
breath
it's
beginning
to
notice
now
the
rhythm
of
breathing
starting
to
notice
how
each
breath
is
long
or
short
deep
or
shallow
he
focused
on
the
sounds
in
the
forest
[
Applause
]
yes
when
I
was
saying
now
a
different
sounds
coming
down
and
it
was
a
strange
but
pausing
with
this
things
[
Applause
]
who
's
chef
ringing
to
explain
[
Applause
]
whether
is
the
breath
will
the
sound
either
require
any
manifest
little
control
so
just
letting
go
when
he
need
to
control
resting
the
attention
very
lightly
[
Applause
]
even
just
for
a
moment
now
[
Applause
]
letting
go
of
any
focus
on
a
breath
for
any
specific
sound
I
'm
just
allowing
your
mind
do
whatever
it
wants
to
do
[
Applause
]
thanks
for
letting
the
mind
is
free
[
Applause
]
and
then
just
bring
the
attention
back
to
the
body
once
again
turn
back
to
that
way
of
contact
[
Applause
]
starting
to
notice
the
different
sounds
again
in
a
little
more
detail
and
whenever
you
feel
ready
just
gently
opening
the
eyes
and
as
you
open
the
eyes
just
maintain
a
position
for
a
few
moments
just
coming
back
to
where
we
started
with
that
very
soft
focus
taking
in
not
only
the
trees
around
us
in
the
forest
those
are
the
mountains
in
the
distance
the
sky
above
I
'm
just
carrying
with
you
that
sense
of
space
into
wherever
and
whatever
you're
doing
next
[
Applause
]
This
is
a
guided
meditation
on
being
fearless
.
As
you
begin
to
get
settled
in
,
find
a
comfortable
position
And
bring
your
attention
to
taking
comfortable
and
natural
breaths
.
Becoming
aware
of
the
air
movement
And
the
movement
in
your
chest
.
Allowing
your
body
to
be
relaxed
,
yet
alert
.
Bringing
awareness
to
every
part
of
it
.
Your
eyes
.
Hands
.
Feet
.
The
surface
you
are
sitting
or
laying
on
.
Every
detail
clear
and
present
.
And
as
you
find
this
place
of
presence
,
I
will
share
with
you
our
theme
of
being
fearless
.
In
such
a
complex
and
unpredictable
world
,
Fear
can
find
its
way
into
our
mind
in
many
ways
.
Fear
about
making
the
wrong
decision
.
Fear
about
the
future
.
Fear
of
the
unknown
.
Healthy
fear
,
or
caution
,
as
we
will
call
it
,
Allows
us
to
make
informed
decisions
To
protect
and
shield
against
harm
.
But
less
healthy
fears
could
be
those
that
Might
not
have
clear
resolutions
.
They
could
be
situations
or
unknowns
That
we
are
unable
to
change
.
They
are
the
kinds
of
fears
that
won
’
t
immediately
bring
about
proaction
But
instead
,
take
our
mind
away
from
presence
and
peace
.
Instead
of
pushing
away
those
less
healthy
fears
when
they
arise
,
It
is
good
and
right
for
us
to
acknowledge
them
,
But
then
we
allow
ourselves
to
set
them
aside
.
To
remind
ourselves
that
these
fears
do
not
have
control
over
us
Or
our
contentment
.
And
so
,
as
you
bring
your
attention
to
these
ideas
,
Recognizing
the
differences
between
Healthy
caution
and
less
healthy
fear…
Just
continue
to
focus
on
that
natural
breath
In…
and
out
.
Just
allowing
your
body
to
become
a
bit
more
relaxed
And
your
mind
to
be
a
bit
more
present
With
each
and
every
breath
in…
and
out
.
And
just
again
,
remembering
to
bring
focus
and
relaxation
To
every
part
of
your
body
.
Like
a
gentle
wave
You
can
feel
it
move
from
the
top
of
your
head
All
the
way
down
and
out
the
very
tips
of
your
toes
.
With
that
gentle
breath
and
air
movement
,
Recognizing
your
heartbeat
Allow
yourself
to
find
this
place
of
stillness
.
And
as
you
do
so
,
I
invite
you
to
join
in
on
some
short
phrases
That
will
serve
as
reminders
.
Whether
out
loud
or
in
your
head
,
You
can
just
repeat
after
me
After
each
phrase
Feeling
each
word
and
phrase
deeply
As
you
hear
them
Starting
now
:
In
every
moment
Aware
of
fearful
thoughts
.
Welcoming
this
fear
.
Recognizing
this
fear
.
Then
setting
my
fear
aside
.
Just
for
now
.
Setting
my
fear
aside
.
Great
job
.
It
is
our
instinct
to
run
from
our
fear
when
such
thoughts
arise
.
A
thought
of
a
fear
that
we
can
not
control…
Or
a
fear
of
something
of
much
greater
consequence
than
ourselves
But
what
are
running
from
?
We
run
from
a
thought
,
and
not
the
real
fear
.
And
therefore
,
we
become
stuck
in
a
loop
with
no
exit
.
We
let
it
linger
,
chase
us
,
cloud
our
vision
Build
our
anxiety
.
This
process
and
action
of
setting
our
fears
aside
,
Is
a
useful
tool
.
And
we
can
also
use
this
with
anxiety
that
can
arise
from
fear
.
Welcoming
it
,
recognizing
it
,
But
not
allowing
it
to
overcome
us
Or
eat
away
at
us
.
Only
allowing
ourselves
to
process
it
When
such
thoughts
will
cause
useful
action
in
the
present
time
Rather
than
useless
strain
on
our
mind
and
body
.
And
so
,
I
invite
you
to
repeat
these
phrases
,
once
again
.
But
this
time
,
focusing
on
the
anxiety
that
stems
from
fear
.
Breathing
gently
,
Continuing
to
sit
comfortably
.
Beginning
now
.
In
every
moment…
Aware
of
anxious
thoughts
.
Welcoming
this
anxiety
.
Recognizing
this
anxiety
.
Then
,
setting
my
anxiety
aside
.
Just
for
now
.
Setting
my
anxiety
aside
.
Excellent
again
.
Sometimes
,
setting
aside
our
fear
and
anxiety
Is
more
easily
said
than
done
.
You
an
use
these
techniques
to
serve
as
a
daily
,
Or
even
minute
by
minute
reminder
That
there
are
so
many
of
those
useless
and
unhelpful
thoughts
Floating
around
within
our
minds
.
We
can
practice
being
proactive
Rather
than
reactive
with
our
mind
.
We
can
find
such
peace
When
we
allow
ourselves
to
pull
our
mind
along
Rather
than
let
our
minds
unconsciously
pull
us
.
And
so
now
,
as
you
are
here
in
this
place
of
presence
,
Recognizing
your
fears
,
Recognizing
your
anxiety
,
If
you
like
,
stay
here
with
this
background
music
For
the
next
little
while
.
And
in
these
last
few
spoken
moments
of
this
session
.
I
encourage
you
to
just
continue
to
connect
deeply
With
your
mind
and
body
.
Continue
to
sense
yourself
in
this
place
,
Enjoy
becoming
the
watcher
of
your
thoughts
And
practice
that
relationship
with
your
fear
and
anxiety
.
And
again
,
not
pushing
away
or
running
away
,
But
welcoming
,
recognizing
,
And
then
just
setting
aside
.
Know
that
you
CAN
make
this
better
for
yourself
.
You
can
be
strong
.
You
can
be
present
and
aware
.
You
practice
and
know
that
you
can
do
this
.
And
so
,
you
WILL
do
this
Fearless.foreign

foreign
practice
let
us
begin
today
by
finding
a
comfortable
seated
position
at
the
center
of
your
mat
feeling
yourself
balanced
and
grounded
as
we
take
a
deep
breath
in
and
reach
both
of
our
arms
up
to
the
sky
starting
our
practice
with
this
beautiful
welcoming
breath
in
and
as
you
exhale
bring
your
hands
down
together
towards
your
heart
feeling
the
energy
between
your
hands
close
your
eyes
let
's
go
inward
for
a
moment
before
we
begin
to
move
breathe
and
Flow
let
us
connect
to
today
's
intention
the
intention
of
rooting
ourselves
in
the
idea
of
creating
a
strong
Foundation
not
just
for
the
seven
day
Journey
or
your
personal
yoga
practice
but
through
awareness
opening
ourselves
up
to
the
idea
that
once
we
begin
to
build
a
strong
daily
foundation
in
our
life
we
give
ourselves
the
opportunity
to
ascend
upward
from
that
point
forward
the
first
step
in
setting
up
a
strong
foundation
in
our
practice
and
in
our
life
begins
with
coming
to
terms
with
the
realization
that
where
you
are
right
now
in
your
practice
in
your
life
circumstance
and
In
This
Moment
is
exactly
where
you
need
to
be
so
whether
you
're
in
a
good
place
in
your
life
or
in
a
place
where
you
seek
Improvement
let
's
for
this
moment
right
now
find
true
peace
with
wherever
you
are
in
your
personal
Journey
do
n't
fight
it
or
resist
it
but
simply
with
a
deep
breath
completely
and
wholeheartedly
accept
yourself
as
you
are
so
breathe
in
and
exhale
out
for
the
next
seven
days
of
this
journey
each
day
we
'll
be
focusing
on
a
different
chakra
in
our
body
a
chakra
is
an
energetic
center
that
is
responsible
for
the
free-flowing
movement
of
a
chronic
energy
and
life
force
throughout
our
entire
being
when
a
chakra
is
balanced
and
vibrant
we
thrive
and
when
there
are
blockages
we
experience
their
energetic
restrictions
in
our
life
there
are
seven
chakras
and
each
stacked
in
a
perfect
Divine
ladder
along
the
column
of
our
own
spines
and
each
day
we
will
Ascend
up
this
energetic
ladder
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
in
order
to
balance
and
recharge
each
one
in
order
that
they
are
located
today
we
'll
begin
with
the
first
one
the
root
chakra
which
is
located
at
the
base
of
our
spine
and
is
responsible
for
your
sense
of
Safety
and
Security
on
this
journey
on
Earth
it
consists
of
everything
that
grounds
us
to
stability
in
our
life
by
working
on
opening
and
balancing
a
root
chakra
would
give
ourselves
the
opportunity
to
feel
more
connected
to
ourselves
to
our
mind
and
body
and
to
the
Earth
so
let
's
take
this
moment
again
and
just
connect
to
our
breath
and
let
it
Let
It
Go
Mother
Earth
is
our
first
mother
our
bodies
formed
from
her
elements
she
creates
the
ultimate
foundation
for
our
existence
on
this
planet
so
let
's
take
another
deep
breath
in
and
as
you
exhale
feel
yourself
become
grounded

perfection
and
with

feeling
in
your

dog
on
one
spot
giving
yourself
whatever
you

in
this

to
just

then
up
towards
the

just
like
we
did
in
the
beginning
of
our
practice
we're
really
trying
to
connect
the
fluidity
and
movement
of
your

inhaling
lowering
down
bowing
to
the
Earth
exhale
opening
up
lowering
down
bowing
to
the
Earth
and
exhale
lifting
up
if
you
like
to
go
even
deeper
you
can
keep
one
hand
on
the
mat
and
reach
that

arm
that
the
leg
is
extended
up
to
the

down

protect
the
knees
as

keep
your
hands
grounded
on
the

or
maybe
it
feels
better
to
grab
your
ankles
wherever
you
are
just
really
focus
on
allowing
that
head
to
come
as
close
to
the
Earth
as
possible
a
gentle
inversion
here
to
decompress
the
spine

also
allow

you
want
to
go
down

lower
again
my
friends
I
just
always
want
to
remind
you

're
down
low
and
like
to

inhale
and
exhale
inhale
lower
exhale
up
hold
it
here
if
you
like
to

deeper
you
can
extend
that
left
arm
up
to
the

and
hold
however
you
can
just
keep
your
hands
grounded
as
well
thank
you

adjust
this
Asana
so
that

mat
lift
your
hips
up

then
from
here
coming
back

fold
but
then
this
time
see
if
you
can
go
further
and
bring
your
hands
through
your
legs
if
that
's
too
much
you
can
grab
your
ankles
and
hold
it
here
remembering
to
slightly
keep
your
feet
pigeon
toe
towards
each
other
and
that's
only
to
protect
your
knees
then
breathe
close
your
eyes
and
with
each
exhalation
allow
yourself
to
relax
deeper
and
deeper
into
this
posture
you
can
bring
your
forehead
to
the
Earth
that
's
great
if
that
's
not
possible
for
you
today
that
's
fine
too

the
most
advanced
variation
is

place
it
underneath
your

just
like
you
're

then
if
it
makes
sense
bring
the
palms
of
your

of
your

into

in
the
present
moment
,
we
focus
and
reflect
on
our
emotions
.
What
may
seem
simple
on
the
surface
,
such
as
a
feeling
of
``
happy
''
or
``
sad
''
,
is
so
often
much
more
complex
.
Feelings
can
arise
seemingly
out
of
our
control
,
and
come
from
places
that
we
may
not
immediately
understand
.
Continue
just
to
relax
,
breathe
comfortably
,
have
awareness
in
the
present
.
Negative
emotions
can
sneak
up
on
us
,
causing
us
not
to
recognize
them
until
they
have
already
deeply
affected
us
.
Feelings
of
contentment
sometimes
pass
us
by
without
us
even
realizing
it
.
What
is
important
is
to
recognize
when
both
positive
or
negative
emotions
arise
within
us
.
Once
we
have
that
recognition
,
we
can
choose
to
act
on
those
feelings
,
but
we
do
n't
necessarily
need
to
.
Simply
being
aware
is
a
form
of
process
;
of
self-improvement
.
It
is
not
wrong
or
bad
to
feel
negative
emotions
.
These
can
happen
naturally
and
could
be
an
important
part
of
working
through
difficulty
or
grieving
.
But
it
is
important
to
recognize
where
these
negative
emotions
come
from
and
when
they
start
to
overtake
us
.
Anger
,
fear
,
guilt
,
whatever
difficult
feeling
arises
,
we
must
continuously
listen
to
our
minds
.
Sometimes
it
may
feel
like
a
constant
storm
brewing
within
us
.
Watching
and
understanding
can
be
our
key
to
feeling
more
in
control
,
more
present
,
more
at
peace
.
And
so
,
following
this
spoken
portion
of
the
meditation
,
feel
free
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
silently
meditate
on
your
emotions
.
Remembering
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
your
emotions
.
Work
to
understand
them
and
how
they
are
affecting
each
of
us
.
Decide
if
the
emotion
necessitates
action
.
Relax
and
stay
in
the
presence
of
your
emotions
.
And
if
the
feeling
is
right
,
just
let
it
go
.
Let
it
go
.
Let
it
go
.
Recognizing
our
emotions.foreign
you
are
stronger
than
you
even
know
this
guided
mindfulness
meditation
will
help
you
to
understand
yourself
more
deeply

that
place
of

nowthere
will
be
times
in
all
of
our
lives
when
we
will
inevitably
experience
suffering
and
loss
you
may
be
going
through
this
right
now
or
you
may
have
gone
through
it
in
the
past
in
these
situations
you
may
feel
overwhelmed
detached
fearful
or
full
of
anxiety
confusion
helplessness
or
profound
sadness
to
a
certain
extent
these
feelings
are
human
and
normal
however
they
can
be
magnified
even
more
if
a
tragic
event
strikes
whether
as
a
close
personal
situation
[
Music

or
as
a
difficult
event
on
a
larger
scale
many
we
are
seeing
on
a
daily
basis
this
meditation
session
is
intended
to
help
us
understand
our
feelings
and
connect
more
deeply
with
the
present
moment
it
will
help
us
to
see
the
underlying
beauty
despite
the
challenging
circumstances
to
begin
as
i
so
often
suggest
find
a
comfortable
position
either
seated
in
a
chair
or
cross-legged
on
the
ground
sitting
on
carpet
or
having
a
pillow
beneath
you
can
help
aim
to
have
your
body
in
a
position
that
keeps
you
at
ease
but
does
not
cause
you
to
drift
off
to
sleep
be
relaxed
yet
alert
take
a
few
deep
and
gentle
breaths
in
and
out
begin
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
movement
of
your
chest
into
the
airflow
of
your
breath
in
and
out
[

raise
your
awareness
of
your
own
body
arms
legs
head
that
gentle
movement
of
the
chest
finding
presence
and
awareness
and
as
you
settle
in
now
we
bring
ourselves
to
a
point
of
focus
what
is
it
that
is
weighing
heaviest
on
your
mind
suffering
and
grief
can
be
overwhelming
and
you
may
struggle
to
know
exactly
how
you
should
be
feeling
think
about
this
question
and
take
a
moment
to
recognize
those
scenarios
and
those
specific
feelings
that
are
taking
over
your
thoughts
in
the
next
minute
or
so
try
to
mentally
narrow
down
your
biggest
points
of
trouble
or
struggle
to
the
top
three
some
may
be
obvious
or
others
less
so
so
take
a
minute

three
now

as
you
continue
to
breathe
so
gently
and
be
aware
of
your
body
in
the
space
that
you
are
in
we
will
attempt
to
dissect
these
thoughts
and
dissolve
unnecessary
pain
and
suffering
something
that
can
help
us
is
to
recognize
what
we
can
and
can
not
do
about
it
when
you
think
of
these
top
three
items
weighing
on
your
mind
consider
what
are
the
things
that
you
can
personally
control
for
example
you
ca
n't
take
away
someone
's
sickness
but
you
can
be
compassionate
toward
them
and
toward
their
friends
and
family
or
although
you
can
not
bring
a
loved
one
back
that
has
passed
away
you
can
honor
their
memory
and
continue
to
spread
love
on
their
behalf

sit
and
breathe
in
comfortable
awareness
and
take
a
few
moments
to
consider
this
for
each
thought
which
part
is
out
of
your
control
and
which
part
can
you
control
think
about
this
now
[
Music
]
[
Music

as
you
keep
these
thoughts
in
mind
think
about
what
these
actions
would
mean
to
you
if
you
were
the
one
who
suffered
or
was
feeling
lost
this
practice
helps
us
to
realize
that
there
is
a
lot
we
often
can
not
control
if
we
allow
those
things
to
weigh
heaviest
on
our
minds
it
can
take
away
from
our
positive
energy
we
can
make
a
large
impact
by
transferring
that
energy
into
an
area
of
action
that
can
make
a
difference
now
it
is
time
to
let
go
continue
to
breathe
ever
so
calmly
and
gently
feeling
that
awareness
of
your
breath
and
of
your
body
allow
yourself
to
feel
this
present
moment
and
realize
that
you
are
here
sitting
with
your
thoughts
just
you
right
now
and
as
we
start
to
let
go
think
again
of
those
things
that
you
can
not
change
and
realize
how
those
intrusive
thoughts
will
only
weigh
you
down
take
another
calm
and
gentle
breath
and
say
to
yourself
i
let
them
go
imagine
those
intrusive
thoughts
as
a
light
balloon
floating
away
rather
than
a
heavy
anvil
on
your
mind
say
to
yourself
again
i
let
them
go
each
time
imagine
a
small
weight
being
lifted
off
your
chest
like
these
ocean
waves
drifting
away
each
breath
allowing
you
to
feel
lighter
and
free
allow
your
mind
to
become
open
accepting
of
thought
but
aware
of
each
thought
that
comes
about
if
a
negative
thought
arises
catch
that
thought
and
imagine
a
positive
thought
or
action
to
counteract
and
let
go
of
the
bad
for
just
a
bit
longer
as
you
continue
to
breathe
gently
and
draw
focus
to
your
breath
body
and
mind
spend
these
last
few
minutes
catching
your
thoughts
as
they
arise
and
imagining
positivity
and
strength

with
a
tall
straight
back

your
breath
in
any

just
let

happen
on
their
own
spontaneously
we

now
scan
the
body

to
bottom
paying
close
attention
to
each
area
start
by
focusing
on
the
crown
of
your
head
and
the
scalp
and
sensing
what
is
going
on
there
you
could
experience
throbbing
Heat
tingling
or
gentle
vibrations
you
might
feel
nothing
whatsoever
or
the
sensation
might
be
very
powerful
now
shift
your
focus
to
your
jaw
face
and
forehead
relax
the
muscles
in
this
area
let
these
Sensations
vanish
if
you
're
subsequent
breath

letting
the
sides
back
and
throat
of
your
neck
become
softer
take
note
of
any
Sensations
that

either
on
the
Skin
's
surface
or
deeper

any
stress
or
stiffness
lying
there
inhale
deeply
into
your
shoulders

any
areas
that
feel
tight

your
attention
on
your
fingers
Palms
and
wrists
As
you
move
down
your
arms
allow
them
to
relax
on
your
next
breath
come
now
to
the
chest
and
watch
each
breath
as
it
rises
and
falls
observe
your
lungs
expansion
and
contraction
give
your
upper
and
lower
back
special
attention
given
that
we
frequently
hold
stress
in
this
region
there
may
be
considerable
intensity
here
simply
pay
attention
to
what
's
there
if
you
feel
any
discomfort
one
more
attention
soften
a
tiny
bit
more
with
each
breath
circling
your
abdomen
with
pay
attention
to
your
pelvis
as
it
expands
fills
with
air
and
then
slowly
empties
as
you
exhale
direct
your
breath
into
this
spot
relaxing
into
Stillness
where
your
body
meets
the
ground
or
your
chair
consider
your
thighs
as
you
scan
your
legs
paying
attention
to
where
they
make
contact
with
the
cushion
or
chair

can
soften
and

can
be
released
by
focusing
Less
on
your

more
on
your

Shins
calves
breathe
in
through
your
toes
feet
and
ankles
when
you
're
ready
let
them
sink
into
state
of
at
ease
awareness
allowing
them
soften
consider
your
feelings
for
a
moment
as
our
session
draws
to
a
close
since
meditation
frequently
has
this
effect
on
people
you
might
discover
that
you
're
more
at
ease
this
is
only
one
of
the
many
benefits
of
meditation
during
stressful
situations
when
we
are
under
stress
our
amygdala
lights
up
making
it
challenging
for
us
to
make
deliberate
decisions
therefore
meditation
can
be
used
as
a
strategy
to
quiet
the
Mind
down
if
we
discover
that
it
is
clouded
as
a
result
of
overwhelm
in
an
Ideal
World
we
would
meditate
as
a
preventative
measure
to

back
to
your

come
back
to
your

come
back
to
this

allowing

to
stir
once
again

moments

n't
seem
to
let
its
Grip
Go
from

simply
when
you
feel

just
need
a
reminder
because
we
all
forget
from
time
to
time
more
often
than
not
that
we
each
of
us
have
the
power
to
just
exhale
deeply
slowly
and
come
back
to
this
moment
to
this
state
of
being

this
thought
I
am
in

this
is
a
meditation
on
love
peace
and
happiness
for
the
next
little
while
find
a
comfortable
position
you
can
be
sitting
cross-legged
on
the
floor
seized
in
a
chair
or
lying
down
whatever
is
best
for
you
so
long
as
you
can
allow
yourself
to
remain
focused
and
present
in
just
a
moment
we
will
start
by
taking
three
deep
rejuvenating
breaths
in
and
out
as
we
do
feel
the
air
flow
through
your
nostrils
see
your
chest
open
up
and
then
gently
release
breathing
normally
in
between
take
the
first
breath
in
now
and
slowly
relays
allow
your
mind
and
body
to
feel
free
it
's
beginning
to
release
any
unwanted
stress
and
tension
[
Music
]
now
take
another
deep
breath
feeling
that
same
release
stress
in
tension
[
Music
]
and
then
once
more
deep
breath
feeling
it
to
your
nostrils
filling
your
chest
and
then
let
the
air
release
and
then
just
continue
to
maintain
calm
relaxed
the
normal
pattern
of
breathing
as
you
settle
in
we
recognize
the
present
moment
and
gain
focus
on
the
here
and
now
we
realize
that
the
past
is
only
our
memory
in
the
future
is
just
our
projected
thoughts
but
the
ever
passing
present
moment
to
moment
it
's
where
we
are
and
where
we
want
to
be
right
now
[
Music
]
and
as
you
continue
to
maintain
that
relaxed
and
natural
breathing
pattern
just
allow
your
mind
to
gently
focus
on
either
that
gentle
airflow
in
and
out
of
your
nose
or
that
gentle
movement
of
your
chest
up
and
down
our
breath
into
heartbeat
are
ever-present
reminders
of
the
methodical
continuation
of
time
not
in
a
way
that
should
make
you
anxious
but
just
in
realizing
that
we
are
a
small
piece
of
a
vast
universe
we
recognize
ourselves
as
our
own
separate
being
and
yet
are
one
in
the
same
as
all
other
living
things
in
all
of
nature
and
amongst
the
stars
and
planets
and
galaxies
[
Music
]
realize
that
beauty
and
the
beauty
around
you
and
continuing
to
breathe
comfortably
begin
to
feel
the
entirety
of
yourself
within
your
space
you
may
notice
certain
slight
tingling
sensations
throughout
your
body
every
nerve
ending
may
become
especially
sensitive
to
your
surroundings
each
detail
such
as
a
small
extraneous
noise
with
a
light
within
the
room
the
surfaces
you
're
touching
or
the
position
of
your
body
will
all
be
a
part
of
your
awareness
but
you
have
no
need
to
become
attached
to
them
simply
remain
aware
of
each
detail
and
then
continue
to
embrace
the
presence
of
this
moment
and
down
breathing
gently
and
calmly
ever
present
ever
aware
[
Music
]
No
we
will
draw
our
focus
onto
this
feeling
of
love
and
peace
by
taking
a
few
moments
just
allowing
you
to
mentally
recite
few
simple
words
and
we
will
count
down
from
five
to
one
just
slowly
repeat
these
words
in
your
mind
you
retain
that
awareness
that
complete
and
full
awareness
your
surroundings
without
any
attachment
five
love
and
peace
[

mentally
repeating
after
me
for
presence
and
contentment
and
again
three
love
and
peace
[

to
presence
and
contentment
and
finally
what
love
and
peace
great
now
you
may
feel
twice
as
calm
twice
as
comfortable
twice
as
aware
and
you'll
feel
that
love
for
all
things
deep
within
you
almost
like
a
fire
burning
in
the
center
of
your
being
now
we
will
do
the
same
thing
once
more
and
this
time
with
each
number
just
allow
yourself
to
become
twice
as
focused
twice
as
realized
with
every
single
number
five
I

tor
I

3
I
feel
love
and
peace
-
I
feel
presence
and
contentment
choices
relaxed
with
each
number
and
finally
one
I
feel
love
and
peace
although
we
often
use
the
word
happiness
as
a
state
of
mind
for
which
we
ultimately
wish
to
strive
you
may
instead
wish
to
think
of
the
word
contentment
of
the
definition
behind
the
word
happiness
a
feeling
of
what
we
often
consider
overwhelming
happiness's
so
very
often
fleeting
unexpected
this
is
an
emotion
for
which
we
may
strive
for
in
vain
and
thus
only
end
up
with
greater
frustration
yet
a
constant
awareness
can
bring
a
lasting
contentment
a
deep
and
profound
yet
subtle
inner
joy
that
persists
through
all
of
life
's
experiences
it
can
keep
us
grounded
through
the
times
of
great
success
or
fortunate
and
also
keep
us
afloat
through
tragedy
and
pain
this
deep
awareness
and
ultimately
love
can
be
had
for
not
only
other
people
but
for
yourself
and
for
all
of
existence
we
as
human
beings
are
uniquely
capable
of
love
and
what
an
incredible
gift
to
be
aware
of
and
express
to
others
even
an
expression
of
love
within
ourselves
is
a
positive
step
toward
peace
within
such
a
constantly
disruptive
world
and
as
you
continue
to
listen
to
these
thoughts
and
ideas
with
this
full
awareness
of
the
present
moment
an
awareness
of
a
halt
that
is
around
you
in
the
here
and
now
embrace
this
now
and
mentally
repeat
after
me
once
more
this
time
with
several
shortening
phrases
to
take
with
you
once
you
finish
I
embrace
love
I
embrace
love
I
embrace
peace
[

I
embrace

I
embrace

I
embrace

I
grace
joy
I
embrace
joy
I
embrace
the
here
and
now
I
embrace
the
here
and
now
very
good
this
will
soon
conclude
the
spoken
portion
of
this
session
and
so
now
you
may
choose
to
continue
to
meditate
for
several
more
minutes
as
the
background
music
continues
or
prepare
to
come
back
and
continue
on
throughout
your
day
or
perhaps
fall
asleep
if
you
're
at
that
point
but
now
just
hear
these
words
one
last
time
as
we
conclude
love
peace

and

voice
that
we
carry
with
us
.
The
one
that
creates
a
narrative
in
our
mind
.
We
might
feel
as
though
we
are
in
full
control
of
these
thoughts
in
our
head
,
yet
,
if
we
reflect
on
the
times
when
we
become
lost
in
thought
,
allowing
our
mind
to
follow
all
of
its
various
pathways
,
we
might
realize
that
many
of
these
thoughts
happen
outside
of
our
control
and
you
may
notice
that
you
have
these
thoughts
each
and
every
day
.
Every
hour
or
even
every
minute
.
It
might
feel
exhausting
to
have
this
continual
narrative
happening
in
your
mind
,
particularly
if
it
brings
you
anxious
or
worrisome
thoughts
.
In
this
meditation
and
mindfulness
session
,
we
can
send
you
down
the
road
of
separating
the
anxiety-inducing
and
harmful
thoughts
and
allow
you
to
catch
them
before
they
take
hold
.
It
helps
us
to
become
the
constant
watcher
of
our
thoughts
.
In
control
and
comfortably
aware
.
Continuing
now
to
focus
on
that
natural
and
gentle
breath
,
body
feeling
oh
so
comfortable
and
calm
,
feeling
these
ideas
deeply
and
on
the
next
breath
allow
yourself
to
feel
the
presence
of
your
body
twice
as
deeply
.
You
may
feel
some
tingles
in
your
arms
or
legs
.
Enjoy
being
here
and
now
,
present
and
aware
.
Take
a
few
moments
to
continue
to
center
yourself
and
deepen
your
understanding
of
this
relationship
with
your
thoughts
.
And
in
this
moment
,
I
invite
you
to
share
five
short
phrases
.
You
can
repeat
them
after
me
either
out
loud
or
in
your
head
.
And
as
you
do
so
,
just
continue
to
enjoy
this
time
.
Starting
now
.
Five
:
''
Here
in
this
moment
.
''
Four
:
''
The
watcher
of
my
thoughts
.
''
Three
:
''
Present
and
peaceful
.
''
Two
:
''
Awareness
in
every
breath
.
''
One
:
''
Learning
to
know
myself
deeply
.
''
Great
...
Now
,
we
will
do
a
different
count
.
And
this
time
remembering
the
kinds
of
unconscious
thoughts
we
want
to
make
ourselves
aware
of
.
And
so
continuing
that
comfortable
breath
,
that
present
body
,
we
start
again
.
Five
:
''
Aware
of
anxious
thoughts
.
''
Four
:
''
Aware
of
fearful
thoughts
.
''
Three
:
''
Aware
of
thoughts
of
painful
memories
.
''
Two
:
''
Aware
of
thoughts
about
the
future
.
''
One
:
''
Aware
of
myself
here
and
now
.
''
And
just
once
more
.
``
Aware
of
myself
here
and
now
.
''
You
can
use
these
phrases
at
any
time
throughout
the
day
when
you
find
those
unconscious
thoughts
creeping
in
.
You
will
begin
to
notice
them
more
and
will
mentally
praise
yourself
when
you
let
those
thoughts
melt
away
.
Freeing
yourself
from
the
burden
of
constant
anxiety
or
fear
.
Lifting
the
weight
that
you
have
carried
in
your
mind
for
so
long
.
So
freeing
like
balloons
floating
up
into
the
air
.
Allow
yourself
to
let
go
and
become
aware
in
a
way
that
you
never
imagined
or
even
considered
before
.
And
so
,
as
you
're
enjoying
this
time
,
we
'll
revisit
our
first
countdown
once
more
,
feeling
each
word
with
weight
and
importance
and
knowing
that
you
have
a
healthier
mindset
ready
for
you
that
you
can
carry
forward
into
each
moment
of
every
day
.
And
we
'll
start
once
more
,
now
.
Five
:
''
Here
in
this
moment
.
''
Four
:
''
The
watcher
of
my
thoughts
.
''
Three
:
''
Present
and

''
Two
:
''
Awareness

every
breath
.
''
And
one
:
''
I
will
know
myself
deeply
.
''
Great
job
.
If
you
like
,
take
a
few
moments
in
this
place
of
peace
and
presence
,
then
the
session
will
conclude
.
Remembering
that
awareness
in
each
moment
,
calming
that
voice
in
your
head
day
by
day
,
hour
by
hour
,
moment
by
moment
.
Freeing
yourself
of
that
burden
.
A
weight
you
no
longer
need
to
carry
.
You
have
a
beautiful
future
that
awaits
.
My
speaking
portion
concludes
now

it
is
so
easy
to
allow
our
mind
to
let
us
get
lost
in
thought
this
can
lead
to
fear
negativity
or
unnecessary
pain
imagine
if
all
of
our
thoughts
would
stay
focused
on
either
what
is
happening
in
the
present
moment
or
on
those
thoughts
that
are
truly
helpful
and
beneficial
to
what
is
real
imagine
if
all
of
our
thoughts
would
stay
positive
and
helpful
in
nature
and
we
'd
have
the
ability
to
separate
out
all
of
that
useless
baggage
that
our
mind
carries
like
a
heavy
weight
[
Music

imagine
stepping
back
and
watching
your
thoughts
arise
but
staying
disconnected
almost
laughing
at
them
as
you
let
them
float
away
recognizing
that
they
are
just
distractions
and
burdens
or
better
yet
imagine
that
you
become
fully
present
if
unwanted
thoughts
or
unhelpful
thoughts
do
arise
you
are
able
to
just
let
them
float
away
before
you
can
even
process
them
maybe
even
subconsciously
without
even
doing
any
work
would
n't
that
be
freeing
would
n't
that
make
for
a
better
life
every
single
day
when
you
allow
yourself
to
see
this
you
can
deal
with
any
real
challenges
head
on
with
greater
clarity
and
you
can
appreciate
those
moments
of
presence
more
often
more
fully
let
's
focus
on
that
as
we
do
our
positive
affirmation
meditation
so
now
as
i
always
do
i
ask
you
to
sit
comfortably
[

stretch
a
bit
if
you

loosening
up
your
neck
and

and
gently
bring
your
attention

your

focus
on
the
air
movement
in
and
out
of
your
nostrils
or
you
may
choose
to
direct
your
attention
to
your
chest
gently
rising
and
falling
and
if
you
like
take
a
few
deep
and
rejuvenating
breaths
as
you
settle
in
[

you
may
choose
to
leave
your

open
yet
relaxed
allowing
your
gaze
to
settle
on
an
object
across
the
room
or
in
the
distance
[

or
you
may
instead
allow
your
eyes
to
gently
close
yet
keeping
yourself
alert
and
focused
[

and
now
keeping
that
attention
on
your

body
allow
yourself
to
feel
a
deep
sense
of
the
present
moment
your

your

allow

to
be
here
now
and
finally
as
you
breathe
so
gently

your
afternoon
break
you
decide
to
take
a
walk
in
the
park
close
by
to
the
office
[

visualize
that
last
task
that
last
check
being
made
that
one
thing
that
you
find
on
your
list
for
weeks
has
been
finished
as
luck
would
have
it
as
soon
as
your
hand
leaves
the
page
your
day
is
done
you
end
your
day
in
the
most
idyllic
way
spending
time
with
loved
ones
and
reading
before
bed
your
day
has
been
productive
with
little
spots
of
wander
and
joy
[

your
Monday
can
go
something
like
this
not
exactly
focus
on
the
parts
of
your
work
days
that
you
enjoy
and
I
want
you
to
take
one
final
breath
in
with
a
cleansing
breath
out
[
Music
]
so
it
is
you
can
open
your
eyes
and
if
you
feel
called
grab
your
journal
and
write
about
this
experience
thank
you
hope
you
have
a
wonderful
day
[
Music

this
is
a
guided
mindfulness
meditation
and
finding
contentment
and
inner
peace
as
I
so
often
ask
you
to
do
if
you
have
been
a
part
of
my
other
sessions
find
a
comfortable
position
either
seated
in
a
chair
cross-legged
on
the
ground
or
even
lying
in
bed
if
you
can
remain
focused
and
present
you
can
choose
to
close
your
eyes
or
allow
them
to
remain
open
until
you
find
it
helpful
to
close
them
throughout
this
session
all
that
you
need
to
worry
about
is
hearing
the
sound
of
my
voice
if
a
distraction
arises
just
acknowledge
it
briefly
then
return
back
to
my
voice
remain
in
Pleasant
stillness
and
hearing
the
sound
of
my
voice
as
we
begin
just
continue
to
take
natural
no
comfortable
breaths
through
your
nostrils
but
drawing
your
attention
to
that
air
movement
and
the
gentle
movement
of
your
chest
notice
how
beautiful
it
is
that
we
are
constantly
in
the
cycle
of
breathing
and
yet
rarely
take
notice
of
it
just
as
we
breathe
subconsciously
so
too
can
we
find
ourselves
bringing
about
unnecessary
worry
and
suffering
in
yet
conversely
can
train
ourselves
to
recognize
the
moments
that
our
mind
tries
to
create
a
struggle
and
subsequently
realize
the
beauty
of
a
still
mind
and
body
throughout
our
lives
we
know
that
change
is
inevitable
and
constant
and
yet
we
often
try
to
fight
this
tide
of
change
rejecting
something
that
forces
us
into
the
unknown
or
brings
about
a
circumstance
that
causes
us
suffering
although
change
especially
that
which
causes
us
pain
can
be
difficult
or
unwelcome
there
is
a
means
of
finding
beauty
in
our
ever
present
state
of
change
and
retain
an
inner
stillness
even
when
the
world
around
us
is
less
than
ideal
[
Music

continue
to
allow
your
mind
to
focus
on
this
breathing
exercise
retaining
that
focus
on
the
breath
and
the
sound
of
my
voice
peace
and
stillness
breath
and
voice
there
is
a
mantra
that
I
will
ask
you
to
focus
on
throughout
this
session
the
mantra
is
this
too
shall
pass
why
are
these
four
words
so
important
the
phrase
is
so
simple
it
can
be
intensely
profound
in
your
understanding
of
it
perhaps
there
is
a
time
in
your
life
when
a
circumstance
caused
you
great
struggle
you
may
have
said
to
yourself
this
is
terrible
I
do
n't
want
this
I
wanted
to
go
away
in
those
situations
it
can
be
so
important
and
beneficial
to
recognize
the
beauty
of
the
passage
of
time
in
the
healing
the
time
can
bring
this
too
shall
pass
at
other
times
in
life
we
may
have
moments
that
bring
us
profound
joy
and
happiness
in
these
situations
we
must
also
tell
ourselves
this
too
shall
pass
you
may
wonder
why
we
should
think
this
in
the
happiest
times
as
well
as
sad
wo
n't
that
make
me
sad
to
know
that
the
happy
times
will
inevitably
end
you
might
ask
but
this
recognition
is
not
about
being
happy
or
sad
it
is
about
a
deep
and
powerful
understanding
of
the
nature
of
our
reality
imagine
the
possibility
that
instead
of
struggling
to
achieve
those
fleeting
moments
of
joy
through
the
perfect
convergence
of
circumstances
that
we
have
a
means
of
finding
an
underlying
contentment
throughout
all
changes
suddenly
the
labels
of
good
or
bad
have
less
power
over
us
we
find
ourselves
afloat
in
a
still
and
clear
lake
instead
of
fighting
against
of
rough
and
inevitable
tide
you
see
this
too
shall
pass
means
that
we
find
true
contentment
in
the
ever-changing
present
and
so
with
this
in
mind
let
's
now
allow
ourselves
to
deeply
focus
on
this
concept
continue
to
comfortably
breathe
and
also
recognize
you
're
just
moving
gently
in
and
out
very
naturally
very
calmly
remember
that
stray
thoughts
or
distractions
are
perfectly
normal
and
all
apart
of
this
constant
change
therefore
we
do
not
fight
against
it
but
recognize
it
and
brush
it
away
and
as
we
settle
deeper
into
the
state
of
contentment
an
acceptance
of
ever-present
change
let
's
retain
those
thoughts
as
we
count
slowly
down
starting
at
the
number
5
by
this
too
shall
pass
[
Music

for
clarity
presence
and
stillness
three
this
too
shall
pass
to
clarity
peace
and
stillness
[
Music

one
this
too
shall
pass
allow
yourself
to
sit
in
this
stillness
for
as
long
as
you
wish
to
continue
taking
a
few
moments
just
for
you
gentle
relaxing
breath
the
movement
of
the
chest
remembering
the
ever-present
change
of
all
things

this
is
a
meditation
session
on
coping
with
physical
pain
our
pain
comes
in
many
forms
whether
a
temporary
injury
or
a
chronic
condition
it
may
be
something
that
comes
and
goes
or
may
be
virtually
continuous
it
also
may
be
spread
throughout
a
large
area
of
our
bodies
or
may
be
very
focused
and
acute
whatever
the
situation
you
can
use
this
meditation
to
shape
the
experience
to
fit
the
kind
of
pain
that
you
are
experiencing
also
keep
in
mind
that
meditation
should
serve
as
just
one
of
a
number
of
approaches
to
dealing
with
pain
including
the
possibility
of
physical
therapy
and
natural
remedies
and
dr.
approved
medication
as
we
begin
find
as
comfortable
of
a
position
as
you
can
while
also
remaining
alert
and
present
in
both
body
and
mind
you
may
choose
to
sit
cross-legged
on
the
floor
and
if
that
is
a
bit
uncomfortable
you
can
lean
back
on
a
wall
or
sit
in
a
chair
or
even
lie
down
if
you
are
able
to
retain
your
focus
and
to
begin
just
start
to
bring
focus
to
your
breathing
and
to
your
body
start
to
take
gentle
and
comfortable
breaths
inward
and
outward
not
forcing
anything
but
just
breathing
naturally
focusing
on
that
breath
calmly
speaking
to
yourself
each
time
in
and
end
out
bring
awareness
to
the
flow
of
the
energy
throughout
your
body
[
Music
]
realize
just
how
rare
it
is
that
we
focus
on
certain
parts
of
ourselves
unless
we
're
feeling
some
kind
of
pain
in
that
area
yet
we
can
bring
attention
to
ourselves
and
our
bodies
at
any
time
try
bringing
focus
to
the
nerve
endings
of
your
toes
and
now
feel
that
move
up
down
your
arms
and
into
your
fingertips
may
just
feel
that
slight
tingling
sensation
as
you
bring
your
focus
there
you
can
feel
the
surface
of
where
you
're
sitting
or
leaning
[
Music
]
and
since
the
feeling
of
the
clothes
that
you
're
wearing
can
notice
whether
there
's
a
presence
of
light
in
the
room
and
where
that
's
coming
from
and
what
it
feels
like
you
can
feel
your
eyes
or
eyelids
whether
they
're
open
or
closed
just
becoming
aware
of
yourself
and
everything
around
you
[
Music
]
and
if
you
begin
to
focus
enough
you
might
even
get
the
sense
that
you
are
not
yourself
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
the
universe
but
you
're
just
merging
with
it
becoming
one
becoming
one
with
it
just
being
able
to
observe
it
and
right
now
if
your
eyes
remain
open
as
you
continue
a
calm
pattern
of
breathing
in
and
out
you
may
wish
to
find
a
point
of
focus
in
the
room
again
if
your
eyes
are
still
open
do
n't
do
n't
let
them
strain
just
softly
focus
and
allow
yourself
to
feel
the
weight
of
your
eyelids
start
to
grow
not
a
weight
like
you
're
falling
asleep
but
just
a
weight
of
heaviness
of
focus
of
being
present
in
this
moment
feel
that
weight
grow
as
you
become
more
and
more
focused
more
and
more
aware
and
as
you
continue
settling
in
you
may
be
feeling
your
pain
condition
right
now
or
be
able
to
imagine
how
it
feels
when
it
happens
your
pain
may
cause
you
to
become
frustrated
or
angry
or
sad
her
pain
for
many
people
and
many
different
ways
a
part
of
our
life
and
it
's
in
our
nature
to
want
nothing
more
than
to
avoid
that
pain
and
run
away
from
it
make
it
go
away
right
now
but
for
now
let
's
just
try
something
a
bit
different
[
Music
]
let
's
dive
further
into
focus
by
having
you
repeat
these
short
phrases
after
me
whether
out
louder
in
your
head
just
repeating
slow
breath
so
breath
[

calm

so
breath

[

calm
focused
aware
now
continue
to
allow
yourself
to
sink
in
to
that
deep
state
of
comfort
yes
we
can
maintain
that
until
comfort
even
through
the
physical
pain
and
retain
that
strong
and
welcoming
focusing
energy
[
Music
]
and
now
at
this
time
I
want
you
to
bring
your
focus
again
to
your
pain
if
you're
feeling
it
now
or
the
feeling
that
arises
when
the
pain
becomes
strong
think
of
the
part
or
parts
of
your
body
that
feel
that
pain
most
intensely
imagine
the
emotional
feelings
that
it
brings
up
in
you
when
the
pain
is
happening
keep
this
in
mind
our
goal
is
not
to
eliminate
the
pain
completely
but
to
bring
ourselves
to
a
better
understanding
of
our
pain
to
find
a
relationship
with
that
vein
[
Music

and
as
we
do
so
now
allow
for
one
number
for
each
breath
and
count
down
count
down
with
me
just
repeat
there
in
your
head
or
out

[

breathing
and
on
your
next
breath

recognize

great
job
now
as
you
continue
to
find
even
stronger
focus
and
awareness
than
before
you
have
not
done
so
already
I
just
want
you
to
gently
close
your
eyes
you
might
have
a
long
time
ago
now
in
the
center
of
where
you
would
be
looking
if
your
eyes
were
open
imagine
your
pain
in
front
of
you
see
it
and
visualize
it
in
any
way
that
comes
to
mind
for
some
it
might
be
a
fiery
glowing
orb
or
maybe
a
mass
of
thorns
it
might
look
angry
or
bright
intimidating
uninviting
whatever
you
see
bring
all
your
focus
and
attention
to
that
object
[
Music
]
bring
that
attention
[
Music
]
get
very
clear
right
in
front
of
you
and
now
again
their
attention
focused
repeat
after
me
continuing
to
acutely
see
that
ball
of
pain
before
you
and
follow
the
suggestions
slowly
breathing
and
counting
and
focusing
five
I
see
my
pain
[
Music

or
I
see
my
pain
shrinking
away

I
observe
myself
controlling
my
pain
too
I
see
my
pain
and
one
I
see
my
pain
shrinking
away
[
Music

and
let
it
shrink
way
away

[
Music

excellent
job
right
now
your
pain
if
you
are
presently
feeling
it
maybe
slightly
better
or
it
may
be
just
the
same
either
way
it
's
fine
what
you
are
accomplishing
is
very
important
which
is
raising
your
awareness
of
your
pain
rather
than
letting
your
frustration
sadness
or
anger
take
over
in
times
that
your
pain
worsens
even
might
feel
unbearable
just
return
yourself
to
these
thoughts
I
see
my
pain
[
Music

I
see
my
pain
I
recognize
my
pain
I
recognize
my
pain
I
understand

now
if
you
like
just
take
another
few
moments

focusing
on
your
breathing

out

constant
gently
in
and
out
[
Music
]
bring
your
presence
into
this
moment
arms
relaxed
gaze
focused
in
the
distance
or
eyes
closed
just
allowing
your
body
to
be
comfortable
yet
alert
wherever
you
may
be
[
Music
]
again
focusing
on
natural
gentle
breaths
in
and
out
feeling
the
movement
of
air
through
your
nostrils
or
your
chest
moving
gently
up
and
down
[
Music
]
if
we
open
ourselves
to
being
available
for
each
passing
moment
and
maximizing
contentment
in
what
we
call
the
here
and
now
we
also
open
ourselves
to
the
acceptance
of
happiness
and
contentment
through
this
practice
of
being
present
being
mindful
and
understanding
the
way
that
our
mind
works
we
recognize
how
often
our
thoughts
and
stresses
can
lead
the
mind
astray
digging
into
the
depths
of
our
subconscious
[
Music
]
and
possibly
with
fear
and
angst
the
lingering
on
what
is
wrong
rather
than
what
is
right
and
beautiful
a
place
we
can
look
is
to
what
we
can
control
within
ourselves
realizing
that
happiness
itself
can
not
necessarily
be
forced
or
planned
but
if
we
orient
ourselves
toward
contentment
and
presence
we
can
find
peace
in
the
present
moment
and
awaken
to
the
renewed
possibilities
of
each
new
day
[
Music
]
and
so
take
this
brief
journey
with
me
[
Music
]
and
in
bringing
ourselves
into
this
place
of
energy
focus
continuing
to
recognize
your
breathing
and
your
body
here
in
this
space
just
count
along
with
me
whether
out
loud
or
in
your
head
[
Music

reminding
ourselves
of
breath
and
body
each
time
going

[

as
you
are
here
in
this
peaceful
state
of
awareness
i
ask
you
to
think
of
a
location
that
brings
you
great
joy
[
Music

this
could
be
a
vacation
destination
or
a
childhood
home
it
could
be
real
or
imagined
very
close
by
or
very
far
away
it
could
be
associated
with
a
joyful
memory
or
simply
have
a
wonderful
and
positive
feeling
[
Music
]
take
a
moment
to
think
about
this
place
what
emotions
and
feelings
arise
when
you
bring
your
focus
to
this
place
joy
comfort
a
warm
presence
a
longing
perhaps
a
desire
whatever
you
feel
is
okay
embrace
these
feelings
welcome
them
and
observe
them
to
understand
what
it
might
mean
to
have
these
thoughts
about
this
place
and
ponder
why
those
thoughts
arose
and
as
you
embrace
this
focus
we
will
repeat
some
affirmations
you
can
repeat
these
again
either
out

awesome
now
in
our
next
exercise
we
will
now
focus
on
thoughts
of
a
loved
companion
it
could
be
a
family
member
or
friend
it
could
also
be
a
favorite
pet
[
Music

it
could
be
someone
who
you
see
every
day
there
's
someone
or
something
who
is
very
far
away
[
Music
]
just
think
of
that
meaningful
presence
in
your
life
realize
what
thoughts
of
them
come
into
your
emotions
just
as
with
the
place
that
you
focused
on
it
may
bring
joy
comfort
into
warm
presence
and
may
even
bring
up
other
feelings
such
as
melancholy
nostalgia
or
even
sadness
[
Music
]
if
what
you
're
thinking
of
happens
to
be
far
away
or
not
here
anymore
these
or
any
other
emotions
they
are
all
okay
because
you
are
recognizing
them
you
are
aware
of
them
so
remember
to
embrace
them
welcome
them
observe
them
coming
to
an
understanding
of
what
it
means
to
have
these
thoughts
as
you
think
about
this
companion
[
Music
]
and
as
you
do
so
bring
them
into
your
focus
and
let's
repeat
these
same
affirmations
once
again
again
bringing
that
focus
to
the
companion
in
your
mind
repeating
after

great

this

and
this

you
embrace
and
allow
them
to
help
bring
you
into
the
present
moment
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
at
the
end
of
this
session
just
allow
yourself
a
few
minutes
[
Music

to
continue
to
stay
in
this
presence
and
[
Music
]
give
yourself
a
bit
of
time
to
continue
practicing
presence
and
mindfulness
remember
that
our
lives
are
full
of
forces
ups
and
downs
high
expectations
uncertainty
yet
if
we
remain
aware
of
what
we
most
desire
to
embrace
our
favorite
places
our
best
companions
surround
yourself
with
this
presence
of
feeling
and
you
will
solely
but
surely
[
Music
]
discover
a
deep
and
beautiful
subconscious
contentment
which
can
lead
to
the
to
moment-to-moment
happiness
that
we
so
desperately
crave
[
Music
]
that
sometimes
feels
so
fleeting
[
Music
]
remember
this
and
take
it
with
you
into
the
days
and
weeks
ahead
[
Music

so
again
taking
these
last
few
moments
to
deeply
understand

morning
this
is
a
meditation
session
that
will
help
you
start
off
your
day
feeling
positive
and
uplifted
and
to
have
a
sense
of
calm
and
centeredness
all
throughout
your
entire
day
you
will
be
able
to
better
connect
with
yourself
and
your
surroundings
and
be
able
to
deal
with
any
situation
that
comes
your
way
aware
and
present
as
you
begin
you
may
be
lying
in
bed
or
sitting
in
a
familiar
chair
or
on
a
couch
just
find
a
comfortable
position
that
suits
you
allow
your
attention
to
slowly
direct
itself
to
your
breathing
make
sure
to
take
slow
natural
breaths
and
gently
focus
on
each
time
the
airflow
changes
from
in
to
out
in
tow
when
you
first
woke
up
you
may
have
been
contemplating
all
of
the
tasks
that
you
needed
to
do
today
maybe
you
were
worried
about
something
in
particular
or
trying
to
walk
your
mind
through
the
jobs
that
have
n't
been
done
yet
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
all
of
that
but
for
now
this
is
a
few
minutes
of
your
time
simply
to
set
aside
the
rest
of
the
world
and
become
focused
within
yourself
your
mind
may
try
to
tell
you
how
important
it
is
to
get
back
to
worrying
and
stress
because
that
's
just
what
our
minds
do
but
each
time
it
makes
an
attempt
you
will
be
reminded
that
this
few
minutes
this
few
minutes
is
your
time
keep
that
gentle
focus
on
your
breath
in
and
out
in
and
out
begin
to
embrace
this
morning
and
this
day
by
feeling
the
energy
move
throughout
your
body
feel
the
stillness
around
you
even
if
there
are
noises
or
distractions
they
are
all
ok
just
focusing
now
on
you
in
this
space
your
arms
your
legs
the
energy
and
your
hands
all
throughout
you
and
on
the
next
breath
bring
your
attention
to
that
space
in
your
head
right
in
the
center
feeling
moving
just
behind
your
eyelids
you
might
feel
some
heaviness
to
your
eyes
which
may
remain
open
or
have
gone
closed
let
's
find
either
way
remember
this
is
n't
a
heaviness
like
sleep
but
rather
it
's
the
weight
and
in
a
way
the
lightness
of
your
focus
and
your
awareness
it
can
be
easy
to
associate
meditation
with
sleep
because
of
how
we
are
still
and
sometimes
have
our
eyes
closed
but
it
really
is
just
the
opposite
you
have
a
keen
awareness
of
everything
around
you
and
just
observing
and
letting
everything
go
and
just
for
the
moment
just
for
this
moment
now
as
we
bring
this
day
and
your
surroundings
into
focus
I
'll
just
ask
that
you
slowly
repeat
a
short
phrase
after
me
you
can
do
this
in
your
mind
or
out
loud
whatever
you
prefer
or
if
you
wish
you
can
simply
listen
without
forcing
anything
continue
to
feel
the
energy
around
your
body
like
a
warm
ray
of
glowing
light
and
your
head
neck
arms
legs
and
even
out
the
very
tips
of
your
toes
and
then
slowly
all
the
way
back
back
from
the
ground
all
the
way
up
through
you
and
out
the
very
top
of
your
head
and
into
that
point
of
focus
just
behind
your
eyes
feeling
light
present
and
aware
and
now
if
you
wish
repeat
after
me
it
's
five
phrases
and
we
'll
start
by
doing
each
one
twice
in
a
row
five
I
embrace
today
and
again

embrace

I
'm
good
continuing
that
natural
relaxing
breath
we
'll
do
this
once
again
just
one
time
through
this
time
and
keep
in
mind
if
you
ever
have
a
moment
of
stress
during
your
day
today
step
aside
for
just
a
couple
of
minutes
and
give
yourself
a
five-second
countdown
maybe
you
will
pick
one
of
these
as
your
favorite
phrases
and
create
your
own
or
simply
countdown
it
's
all
good
it
is
all
okay
once
again
with

And
as
you
bring
yourself
into
this
present
moment
,
I
invite
you
to
set
aside
the
past
and
not
think
about
the
future
.
Right
now
,
the
only
goal
is
to
be
right
here
,
right
now
.
The
movement
of
your
breath
and
the
sound
of
my
voice
.
Just
repeat
these
words
after
me
''
''
Here
in
this
moment
.
''
``
Peaceful
and
present
.
''
And
once
more
:
''
Here
in
this
moment
.
''
``
Peaceful
and
present
.
''
Great
.
And
now
we
are
ready
to
begin
the
body
scan
.
As
we
do
this
,
you
may
feel
various
sensations
throughout
your
body
.
This
shows
just
the
kind
of
powerful
connection
your
mind
has
with
your
body
.
Welcome
these
and
continue
to
follow
along
.
Begin
with
a
focus
at
the
very
top
of
your
head
.
Bring
your
attention
there
and
relax
the
muscles
in
your
eyes
.
Using
each
time
you
breathe
out
to
bring
an
added
release
of
tension
.
And
as
you
relax
those
muscles
in
your
eyes
,
feel
that
relaxing
energy
moves
slowly
down
into
your
jaw
.
Notice
if
you
are
clenching
or
tight
.
And
as
that
energy
moves
,
I
like
to
imagine
this
flow
as
a
glowing
light
,
or
the
flow
of
water
as
it
moves
down
.
Notice
any
places
that
you
are
possibly
creating
tension0
even
where
you
did
n't
notice
it
before
.
Now
feel
that
slow
energy
move
down
through
your
neck
and
shoulders
.
Just
releasing
all
of
that
tension
.
Letting
go
of
any
remaining
tightness
.
And
then
it
slowly
moves
down
into
your
arms
.
Imagine
that
relaxing
energy
slowly
moving
up
your
arms
.
And
then
continuing
down
through
your
chest
and
torso
.
And
with
your
next
breath
,
just
allow
all
of
that
tension
in
your
upper
body
to
release
even
further
.
Letting
go
of
any
of
that
remaining
tightness
.
Just
full
focus
on
your
relaxed
body
and
muscles
.
Let
that
imagined
glow
or
flow
of
water
feel
and
remain
ever-present
.
And
now
we
'll
continue
on
down
into
your
legs
,
,
just
the
same
allowing
those
muscles
to
relax
,
and
then
relax
even
further
.
You
are
remaining
alert
,
but
your
body
is
feeling
so
free
of
that
remaining
tension
.
And
as
this
happens
,
finally
,
let
it
move
into
your
feet
and
all
the
way
out
the
tips
of
your
toes
.
Now
imagining
your
body
bathed
in
that
warm
glow
,
here
in
the
present
moment
.
Just
spend
a
few
more
moments
enjoying
this
.
Remember
,
this
is
your
time
to
be
here
in
the
present
moment
.
Focused
and
relaxed
here
and
now
.
And
now
,
you
will
prepare
to
come
out
of
this
meditation
and
back
to
your
day
.
But
you
will
retain
those
relaxed
muscles
and
that
sense
of
peace
and
presence
throughout
the
rest
of
your
day
.
And
this
concludes
today
's
session
.

we
will
be
doing
a
guided
body
scan
.
This
is
one
of
my
favorite
techniques
for
bringing
a
sense
of
harmony
between
your
mind
and
body
.
And
also
bringing
you
further
into
the
present
moment
.
Go
ahead
and
find
your
favorite
position
in
order
for
us
to
get
started
.
Just
settle
in
,
and
maybe
even
give
your
arms
a
quick
shake
,
or
gently
rotate
your
neck
a
few
times
just
to
get
yourself
comfortable
.
And
as
we
always
do
,
begin
to
bring
your
attention
to
your
breathing
.
Remember
:
naturally
in
and
out
,
feeling
that
gentle
movement
of
your
chest
.
Also
remembering
to
keep
your
back
straight
and
shoulders
just
slightly
pulled
back
.
And
as
you
bring
yourself
into
this
present
moment
,
I
invite
you
to
set
aside
the
past
and
not
think
about
the
future
.
Right
now
,
the
only
goal
is
to
be
right
here
,
right
now
.
The
movement
of
your
breath
and
the
sound
of
my
voice
.
Just
repeat
these
words
after
me

Here

And
once
more
:

``
Peaceful

present
.
''
Great
.
And
now
we
are
ready
to
begin
the
body
scan
.
As
we
do
this
,
you
may
feel
various
sensations
throughout
your
body
.
This
shows
just
the
kind
of
powerful
connection
your
mind
has
with
your
body
.
Welcome
these
and
continue
to
follow
along
.
Begin
with
a
focus
at
the
very
top
of
your
head
.
Bring
your
attention
there
and
relax
the
muscles
in
your
eyes
.
Using
each
time
you
breathe
out
to
bring
an
added
release
of
tension
.
And
as
you
relax
those
muscles
in
your
eyes
,
feel
that
relaxing
energy
moves
slowly
down
into
your
jaw
.
Notice
if
you
are
clenching
or
tight
.
And
as
that
energy
moves
,
I
like
to
imagine
this
flow
as
a
glowing
light
,
or
the
flow
of
water
as
it
moves
down
.
Notice
any
places
that
you
are
possibly
creating
tension0
even
where
you
did
n't
notice
it
before
.
Now
feel
that
slow
energy
move
down
through
your
neck
and
shoulders
.
Just
releasing
all
of
that
tension
.
Letting
go
of
any
remaining
tightness
.
And
then
it
slowly
moves
down
into
your
arms
.
Imagine
that
relaxing
energy
slowly
moving
up
your
arms
.
And
then
continuing
down
through
your
chest
and
torso
.
And
with
your
next
breath
,
just
allow
all
of
that
tension
in
your
upper
body
to
release
even
further
.
Letting
go
of
any
of
that
remaining
tightness
.
Just
full
focus
on
your
relaxed
body
and
muscles
.
Let
that
imagined
glow
or
flow
of
water
feel
and
remain
ever-present
.
And
now
we
'll
continue
on
down
into
your
legs
,
,
just
the
same
allowing
those
muscles
to
relax
,
and
then
relax
even
further
.
You
are
remaining
alert
,
but
your
body
is
feeling
so
free
of
that
remaining
tension
.
And
as
this
happens
,
finally
,
let
it
move
into
your
feet
and
all
the
way
out
the
tips
of
your
toes
.
Now
imagining
your
body
bathed
in
that
warm
glow
,
here
in
the
present
moment
.
Just
spend
a
few
more
moments
enjoying
this
.
Remember
,
this
is
your
time
to
be
here
in
the
present
moment
.
Focused
and
relaxed
here
and
now
.
And
now
,
as
I
count
down
slowly
from
five
to
one
,
you
will
prepare
to
come
out
of
this
meditation
and
back
to
your
day
.
But
you
will
retain
those
relaxed
muscles
and
that
sense
of
peace
and
presence
throughout
the
rest
of
your
day
.
Counting
down
now
:
Five
.
Four
Three
.
Two
.
One
.
And
now
,
if
you
like
,
spend
just
a
few
more
minutes
in
this
place
of
peace
and
comfort
listening
to
the
ambient
sound
.
And
this
concludes
today
's
session
.
Have
a
wonderful
day
and

Hi
,
I
'm
John
and
I
'm
so
glad
you
're
joining
me
for
this
meditation
to
help
you
start
your
day
.
(
gentle
relaxed
music
)
Our
subconscious
mind
is
most
active
and
,
some
say
,
most
impressionable
right
after
we
wake
up
.
This
gives
us
a
tremendous
opportunity
to
impact
how
the
rest
of
our
day
plays
out
.
We
can
set
a
positively
focused
intention
that
's
in
alignment
with
and
supports
the
type
of
day
we
'd
like
to
have
.
So
to
get
started
,
get
into
a
position
you
can
comfortably
hold
for
a
bit
.
If
you
are
doing
this
meditation
shortly
after
waking
up
be
sure
you
're
not
in
a
position
you
'd
otherwise
fall
back
to
sleep
in
.
Gently
close
your
eyes
.
Begin
to
take
deep
,
refreshing
breaths
.
Allowing
each
breath
to
ease
you
into
a
still
,
focused
state
.
Turning
all
of
your
attention
inward
.
Making
yourself
your
first
priority
in
this
moment
.
Your
only
focus
is
your
wellbeing
.
As
you
continue
to
breathe
this
way
,
notice
the
journey
of
your
breath
through
your
body
,
how
it
feels
as
it
weaves
in
and
out
of
your
cells
,
muscles
and
joints
.
Feeling
the
groundedness
and
connectedness
in
these
areas
.
(
soft
relaxing
music
)
Allowing
the
breath
to
ease
and
release
any
tightness
or
tension
you
may
be
feeling
.
Be
aware
of
any
judgments
that
might
come
up
as
you
do
this
.
It
's
natural
for
this
to
happen
,
so
instead
of
judging
the
judgment
,
simply
acknowledge
that
it
's
there
and
then
let
it
drift
away
.
Replacing
it
with
loving
thoughts
for
how
your
body
will
support
you
through
this
day
too
.
(
gentle
relaxed
music
continues
)
Now
that
we
've
grounded
physically
,
let
's
focus
on
our
internal
intention
for
the
day
.
Most
of
the
time
when
we
think
of
intention
,
we
think
about
the
thing
we
want
to
get
or
experience
.
But
what
's
fascinating
is
that
most
often
we
do
n't
actually
want
the
thing
,
we
want
the
way
to
think
makes
us
feel
.
So
begin
to
focus
now
on
how
you
'd
like
to
feel
today
.
It
can
be
tempting
in
this
process
to
focus
on
what
you
do
n't
want
.
So
if
you
notice
yourself
doing
that
,
it
's
okay
.
Simply
let
that
pass
and
then
refocus
on
what
you
do
want
.
Perhaps
you
want
a
day
filled
with
ease
,
peace
,
joy
,
and
flow
.
Tap
into
the
feelings
you
want
to
experience
today
.
And
as
you
do
,
allow
yourself
time
with
each
one
,
sitting
in
that
feeling
,
allow
it
to
fill
up
your
entire
body
and
heart
.
(
gentle
relaxed
music
continues
)
#
(
calm
music
)
Now
,
how
do
you
want
to
feel
when
the
day
is
done
?
Perhaps
you
want
to
feel
accomplished
,
productive
,
energized
,
or
satisfied
.
Again
,
focus
on
what
you
do
want
.
And
as
you
do
,
allow
yourself
time
with
each
one
,
sitting
in
each
feeling
,
allowing
it
to
fill
your
entire
body
and
heart
.
Now
open
yourself
up
to
allowing
this
intention
to
settle
into
your
unconscious
so
that
your
thoughts
and
actions
for
the
rest
of
the
day
today
can
be
in
alignment
.
(
relaxed
music
)
Continue
breathing
with
your
eyes
closed
.
Just
let
your
attention
start
to
focus
back
on
my
voice
.
Allow
yourself
to
be
guided
by
this
intention
today
.
Allow
it
to
show
you
new
possibilities
you
may
not
have
seen
before
and
guide
your
actions
.
Allow
it
to
inspire
the
journey
of
your
day
with
curiosity
and
maybe
even
a
bit
of
playfulness
.
Now
let
's
take
three
more
deep
breaths
together
.
Take
a
deep
inhale
in
,
holding
it
for
a
beat
and
exhale
it
out
.
Again
,
an
even
deeper
breath
than
the
one
before
.
Feeling
it
weave
in
and
out
of
your
muscles
and
cells
.
And
exhale
it
out
.
Last
time
,
your
deepest
breath
yet
.
Sending
that
oxygen
through
your
entire
body
and
solidifying
once
again
,
your
intention
for
the
day
.
And
when
that
breath
reaches
the
top
of
your
head
and
you
're
ready
,
you
can
open
your
eyes
.
Thanks
so
much
for
joining
me
for
this
meditation
.
I
'm
excited
for
the
day
you
're
about
to
have
.

Today
's
meditation
,
is
going
to
be
all
about
learning
how
to
be
still
and
mindful
of
each
breath
The
goal
of
our
meditation
is
to
allow
ourselves
to
connect
deeper
with
our
inner
selves
By
taking
this
time
to
slow
,
down
and
allow
ourselves
to
connect
to
each
moment
We
realize
that
,
we
are
much
greater
than
this
physical
form
we
embody
?
We
are
souls
with
,
bodies
Not
bodies
with
souls
Take
a
deep
breath
let

begin
with
our
meditation
find

comfortable
position
You
,
can
,
be
seated
on
a
pillow
on
the
floor
or
on
your
bed
or
anywhere
leaning
against
the
wall
Just
find
a
place
for
yourself
Or
there
's
peace
and
quiet
and
where
you
can
,
allow
.
Yourself
to
go
,
deep
within
Close
your
eyes
begin
to
bring
all
of
your
awareness
to
your
breath
inhaling
slowly
and
deeply
through
your
nose
And
exhaling
gently
through
your
nose
or
mouth
inhale
and
exhale
Allow
,
your
hands
to
be
rested
on
your
knees
?
You
can
,
either
keep
your
palms
up
or
you
can
,
keep
them
facing
downward
whatever
is
most
comfortable
Feel
the
surface
underneath
your
sit
bones
Whether
that
is
a
pillow
or
the
floor
?
Allow
,
yourself
to
slowly
begin
to
sink
and
melt
into
the
ground
let
go
allow
,
your
eyes
to
feel
heavy
Letting
them
rest
as
you
continue
to
breathe
,
deeply
relax
,
your
entire
face
Let

any
motions
or
thoughts
Simply

Your
mind
to
take

.
Pause
from
analyzing
judging
or
thinking
give
yourself
permission
to
rest
inhale
and
exhale
Begin
to
feel
your
spine
become
elongated
from
the
very
base
to
the
very
crown
of
your
head
Noticing
that
powerful
energy
running
through
you
Allow
,
your
hands
to
be
relaxed
your
shoulders
to
be
relaxed
Just
feeling
the
belly
rise
and
fall
as
you
gently
breathe

and
exhale
Let

of
your
body
Let

of
everything
that
you
know
Simply

allow
,
yourself
to
enjoy
,

present
moment
Enjoying
,
each
inhalation
and
exhalation
If
you

any
thoughts
and
to
your
mind
Do
not
let
that
be
discouraging
it
's
very
normal
to
notice
different
mind
chatter
and
to
your
mind
especially
when
you
're
first
understanding
the
process
of
meditation
Simply
,
acknowledge
that
the
thoughts
are
there
and
then
come
back
to
the
breath
Visualize
,
these
thoughts
as
clouds
drifting
through
a
,
beautiful
blue
sky
Notice
that
they
're
there
but
,
do
n't
pay
any
attention
to
what
they
mean
Just
let
them
drift
on
by
as
you
let
,
go
inhale
and
exhale
as
You

into

meditative
state

your
inner
self
,

time

mind
distractions

too
much
Repeat

belief
and

With
the
understanding

comfortable
position
sitting

legged
or
against
wall
placing
hands
on
our
knees
the
palms
of
your
hands
pointed
upward
or
downward
closing
your
eyes
and
simply
begin
to
witness
your
breath
feeling
the
inhale
coming
through
the
nostrils
and
exhale
out
letting
go
of
all
the
tension
beging
to
observe
the
movement
of
your
breath
without
trying
to
control
it
if
your
breathe
begins
to
change
becoming
slower
of
faster

changes
to
happen

completely
letting
go
as
you
're
sitting
here
in
your
comfortable
position
its
very
normal
for
our
minds
to
wonder
if
your
attention
drifts

particular
thought
in

a
sound
in
the

Hi
,
everyone
welcome
to
our
medication
for
accepting
the
present
moment
Our
medication
today
is
going
to
focus
on
truly
finding
acceptance
of
what
you
have
and
where
you
are
in
your
life
each
of
Us
[
testicles
]
are
working
towards
an
achievement
a
Lifestyle
or
Perhaps
simply
some
of
our
television
aware
,
how
we
see
your
life
becoming
And
even
though
all
these
goals
and
dreams
are
wonderful
,
and
they
are
a
great
way
to
start
ambitions
for
ourselves
Sometimes
life
throws
things
that
has
better
Beyond
our
control
Sometimes
[
you
]
can
have
like
a
lot
of
breaks
Stopping
definite
tracks
forcing
us
to
overthink
and
review
your
progress
achievements
that
far
The
beautiful
thing
about
life
in
this
existence
Is
that
sometimes
it
's
best
to
people
[
in
]
the
passenger
seat
and
[
he
]
could
be
breath
and
allow
things
to
unfold
how
they
will
And
it
does
n't
mean
that
we
should
be
working
hard
and
trying
[
our
]
best
[
but
]
when
all
is
said
and
done
There
's
nothing
else
you
could
do
The
best
thing
you
can
do
is
let
go
and
go
with
the
flow
This
game
sometimes
only
does
more
harm
to
create
more
struggle
[
or
]
frustration
with
the
inability
to
accept
what
is
to
accept
this
present
moment
You
are
alive
You
're
here
Worrying
about
something
you
can
not
change
or
do
will
only
attract
more
negativity
into
your
life
And
[
that
's
]
faces
who
wants
that
?
So
with
that
said
let
's
begin
our
medication
together
First
let
's
find
a
comfortable
spot
perhaps
on
the
bed
or
on
the
floor
Go
ahead
in
a
cross-legged
position
feeling
your
spine
along
getting
yourself
sinking
into
the
ground
begin
by
closing
your
eyes
and
Just
bring
all
of
your
awareness
to
your
breath
[
maybe
]
breath
into
your
nose
,
and
then
slowly
exhaling
all
the
iraq
the
breath
And
exhale
let
it
go
1yd
backing
And
as
you
exhale
visualizing
all
that
negative
energy
Releasing
out
of
your
body
Mounting
away
out
of
your
body
Allow
yourself
to
be
coming
soon
with
your
body
feeling
the
chest
expand
and
contract
the
Bat-Beam
Hey
left
Letting
go
of
any
tension
in
the
shoulders
Allowing
them
to
drop
and
release
away
from
the
ears
Begin
to
feel
the
sensations
of
peace
and
relaxation
overcome
your
body
breathing
[
in
]
And
picking
a
long
deep
exhale
Your
time
your
time
out
[
to
]
be
with
yourself
[
be
]
wrapping
exhale
Feel
the
heart
beating
in
your
chest
[
you
]
are
pete
Beautiful
organ
bringing
your
life
giving
you
energy
Allow
you
to
have
the
life
that
you
have
the
tracking
and
exhale
out
If
you
start
to
feel
your
body
become
more
and
more
relaxed
Like
you
slowly
introduce
[
our
]
Mantra
Repeating
the
silently
in
your
mind
Simply
using
it
to
come
back
to
whenever
your
mind
starts
to
[
wander
]
[
I
]
release
control
I
surrender
to
the
[
flow
]
[
I
]
release
control
I
surrendered
to
the
flow
[
I
]
release
control
I
surrender
to
the

to
our

for
strength
and
grounding
Today
's
practice
is
going
to
be
about
finding
stillness
and
internal
power
To
remind
ourselves
that
no
matter
what
life
may
throw
our
way
The
strength
that
is
within
us
is
always
powerful
enough
to
help
us
get
through
any
uncertainty
and
challenge
so
as
we
begin
to
reconnect
with
our
inner
selves
,
let
us
come
to
a
comfortable
seated
position
with
the
spine
straight
your
eyes
closed
Take
a
deep
breath
in
Inhale
And
exhale
Allow
the
exhalation
to
release
any
anxious
,
fearful
energy
that
may
be
weighing
you
down
in
this
moment
Allow
the
inhalation
to
give
you
a
moment
to
deepen
your
connection
with
That
peaceful
,
loving
energy
that
resides
within
you
Inhale
Exhale
Keeping
your
eyes
closed
allow
the
body
to
let
go
of
any
physical
tension
Relax
your
forehead
Let
go
of
any
unconscious
facial
tension
Allow
your
eyes
to
become
heavier
Relax
your
jaw
Allow
the
shoulders
to
drop
away
from
the
ears
Just
let
it
go
Inhale
and
exhale
Let
go
of
any
thoughts
,
fears
or
judgments
that
may
enter
your
mind
or
at
any
point
through
this
meditation
This
is
a
moment
for
you
to
be
the
complete
witness
of
everything
that
is
going
on
around
you
internally
and
externally
.
Witnessing
your
body
letting
go
Noticing
any
sounds
of
the
outside
world
as
you
allow
yourself
to
go
deeper
and
deeper
into
this
beautiful
state
of
blissful
awareness
Inhale
And
exhale
Notice
your
breath
Is
it
shallow
?
Or
is
it
deep
?
Can
you
inhale
even
deeper
into
the
lungs
?
Can
you
allow
more
oxygen
to
enter
your
body
?
To
bring
you
new
energy
healing
and
love
into
every
cell
of
your
being
Inhale
Exhale
Notice
the
beat
of
your
heart
the
rythm
of
life
all
sing
and
vibrating
through
you
Inhale
And
exhale
Begin
to
notice
if
you
start
to
see
any
colors
within
the
darkness
of
your
eyes
What
do
you
see
?
What
do
you
feel
?
Open
yourself
to
the
truth
of
what
's
within
you
Do
n't
hold
back
You
are
safe
You
are
sacred
You
are
protected
Do
n't
be
afraid
Inhale
Exhale
Life
will
always
bring
challenges
and
experiences
for
us
to
evolve
through
No
matter
how
difficult
these
experiences
will
get
remember
That
the
power
that
you
seek
is
always
within
you
It
's
within
that
heart
that
beats
with
each
breath
It
has
always
been
within
you
and
once
you
recognize
that
You
realize
that
nothing
in
this
world
is
too
big
for
you
to
overcome
or
grow
from
Each
experience
is
here
to
take
us
to
that
next
level
of
strength
power
and
growth
So
take
a
deep
breath
in
Feel
the
strength
of
vibrating
through
your
body
Reminding
you
that
it
is
here
for
you
to
use
to
overcome
anything
that
challenges
you
in
this
human
experience
Feel
it
Visualize
this
energy
running
through
your
body
as
You
welcome
a
powerful
mantra
into
your
mind
Repeating
this
mantra
as
much
as
you
need
Or
if
you
begin
to
notice
yourself
get
pulled
away
by
the
mind
or
thoughts
of
the
ego
Everything
I
need
is
within
me
Everything
I
need
is
within
me
Everything
I
need
is
within
me
Feel
free
to
continue
to
repeat
this
mantra
if
you
wish
giving
yourself
this
moment
and
silence
to
feel
to
heal
to
breathe
And

to
the
internal
power
of
your
heart
Everything
I
need
is
within
me
Everything
I
need
is
within
me
Everything

and
external
sensations

energy

youWelcome
to
mediation
for
peace
and
positivity
The
focus
of
our
mediation
today
will
be
on
letting
go
of
all
that
no
longer
serves
purpose
any
worries
or
stress
you
might
be
feeling
within
you
and
making
room
to
welcome
positive
loving
energy
Bringing
your
awareness
to
this
negative
energy
and
then
consciously
making
a
choice
to
let
it
go
once
negative
energy
or
thoughts
enter
our
mind
the
ego
lusts
to
swim
in
it
dissect
it
or
dwell
upon
it
the
reality
is
whatever
happens
,
happened
and
it
is
now
in
the
past
once
a
particular
situation
or
moment
has
occurred
in
our
lives
and
we
feel
like
we
've
done
everything
we
could
possibly
do
to
fix
it
or
deal
with
it
,
we
must
find
the
strength
within
us
to
shake
it
out
and
mentally
walk
away
.
to
not
allow
the
negativity
to
continue
to
effect
us
mentally
and
physically
instead
consciously
change
our
thought
patterns
with
awareness
by
welcoming
positive
thoughts
we
will
slowly
start
to
diffuse
the
negativity
and
it
is
truly
incredible
to
witness
this
shift
which
can
almost
happen
instantly
at
times
bringing
love
,
gratitude
and
positivity
will
heal
your
mind
of
negative
thought
patterns
we
are
in
control
of
our
thoughts
and
we
can
obtain
the
power
to
be
able
to
decide
how
much
you
're
willing
to
allow
them
to
affect
us
so
in
this
moment
right
now

decide
to
let
go
of
anything
that
may
be
bothering
us
or
not
allowing
us
to
find
peace
in
our
minds
making
a
conscious
decision
to
release
it

a
rock

the
ocean

it
slowly
sink

and

until
it
is
completely
out

sight

for
more
money
material
abundance
a
better
career
position
that
we
forget
to
appreciate
our
present
moment
and
the
achievement
we
have
gained
this
far
its
all
about
shifting
our
mind
from
seeking
more
of
this
or
more
of
that
and
truly
accepting
the
fact
that
everything
is
exactly
where
it
needs
to
be
that
you
have
everything
you
need
in
this
very
moment
of

this
very
moment

to
your

to
sink
a
little
bit
deeper
into
your
meditative
state

go
surrender
to
the
ground
beneath

towards
the
sky

lengthening
sensation

in
and
a
long
exhale
out
deep
breath
in
and
long
exhale
out

all
the
air

to
become
present
with
your
breath

the
movement
feeling
the
temperature
of
the
air
coming
in
and
out
of
your
body
remember
to
be
the
watcher
of
the
thoughts
seeing
your
thoughts
as
clouds
simplu
drifting
on
by
excepting
that
they
are
thoughts
but
not
paying
any
attention
to
what
they
mean
allow
them
to
be
there
and
then
just
let
them
go
know
that
its
completely
normal
to
become
distracted
so
if
that
happens
to
you
just
accept
it
and

welcome
to
our
meditation
day
5
im
so
happy
you
've
chosen
to
spend
the
next
15
minutes
with
me
and
yourself
i
hope
you
're
able
to
take
this
time
and
put
some
headphones
on
and
shut
everything
off
shut
off
your
phone
close
your
social
media
your
work
and
dedicate
this
precious
time
to
your
health
well
being
and
to
finding
a
moment
of
peace
in
your
mind
todays
meditation
is
going
to
be
on
finding
forgivenss
in
ourselves
to
love
ourselves
enough
to
let
go
of
whatever
no
longer
serves
us
letting
go
anything
that
might
have
been
troubling
you
getting
you
down
or
perhaps
sucking
positive
energy
out
of
your
being
this
can
be
a
person
a
situation
perhaps
a
thought
you
know
you
must
let
go
off
in
order
to
contie
living
a
positive
vibrant
and
happy
life
life
is
a
journey
the
good
the
bad
the
success
and
the
failures
are
all
part
of
it
and
part
of
your
own
growth
in
becoming
the
person
you
're
meant
to
be
we
can
not
appreciate
love
until
we
expereienced
the
opposite
we
ca
n't
fully
appriciate
the
success
we
've
attained
before
we
fall
on
our
face
a
few
times
the
lessons
that
we
learn
is
what
allows
us
to
understand
who
we
really
are
what
we
love
to
do
and
why
we
've
been
brought
here
in
the
first
place
the
trouble
with
this
is
that
its
very
hard
for
us
to
let
go
of
past
experienes
when
they
've
left
a
sour
taste
in
our
mouth
or
person
a
person
that
has
affected
us
our
emotional
state
in
some
negative
way
where
it
lingers
affects
our
life
and
relationship
with
ourselves
this
energy
not
only
brings
negativity
to
your
emotional
state
but
also
can
affect
your
physical
self
in
ways
of
body
aches
,
muscle
tensions
and
headaches
so
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
for
us
is
to
find
a
way
to
release
people
and
situations
that
we
have
no
control
over
let
it
go
and
open
the
space
for
peace
love
and
happiness
with
this
in
mind
lets
begin
our
meditation

a
comfortable

your
feet
crossed

rested
on
your

youWelcome
to
our
meditation
for
acceptance
The
focus
of
of
meditative
practice
today
will
be
unaccepting
and
embracing
our
own
path
and
the
way
life
takes
us
through
it
It
's
important
to
always
set
goals
and
set
out
Expectations
for
ourselves
in
order
to
help
ourselves
become
more
motivated
productive
and
driven
in
our
lives
However
,
it
's
important
.
Especially
when
it
comes
to
setting
expectations
that
we
realize
that
achieving
those
goals
and
attaining
success
is
only
a
part
of
the
journey
the
Process
of
becoming
the
best
we
can
be
in
whatever
scalar
area
we
focus
on
is
What
truly
makes
the
journey
of
life
that
much
more
special
?
growth
lies
in
our
struggle
and
In
those
difficult
times
when
we
truly
see
how
strong
we
are
in
those
moments
We
'll
make
that
decision
to
no
longer
be
treated
a
certain
way
is
when
we
find
our
own
self-worth
It
's
in
those
moments
when
everyone
around
you
says
that
your
goal
,
or
dream
is
too
big
too
unattainable
That
we
have
to
dig
up
that
fire
and
believe
in
ourselves
to
continue
and
push
through
it
That
is
the
journey
and
without
the
struggle
and
the
hardships
the
success
and
the
victory
will
not
taste
a
sweet
So
as
you
move
through
your
everyday
life
,
and
do
your
best
every
day
to
be
the
best
you
can
be
Learn
to
accept
and
embrace
all
that
comes
your
way
Focus
on
each
present
moment
Find
something
to
be
grateful
for
each
day
So
you
can
truly
open
your
heart
to
the
idea
that
everything
is
part
of
this
beautiful
path
that
you
create
for
yourself
each
day
Open
your
heart
to
the
universe
and
Accept
everything
as
it
comes
with
love
and
positivity
Even
when
it
's
the
last
thing
you
want
to
do
Learn
to
love
and
accept
yourself
as
you
are
right
now
beautiful
and
wonderful
Know
that
everything
in
your
life
is
flowing
the
way
needs
to
be
Learn
to
flow
with
the
current
.
Do
n't
resist
it
surrender
Trust
the
process
in
the
end
everything
will
be
okay
,
and
if
it
's
not
that
means
it
's
not
the
end
With
that
said
let
's
begin
our
meditation
find
a
comfortable
seated
position
either
on
the
floor
or
on
your
bed
Sit
up
tall
and
place
your
hands
and
Yana
mudra
Simply
sit
with
your
hands
facing
upward
right
hand
resting
on
top
of
your
left
palm
Close
your
eyes
and
start
to
deepen
your
breath
Inhale
and
exhale
slowly
and
deeply
With
each
exhale
allow
yourself
this
time
to
let
go
of
any
negativity
or
tense
energy
Seeing
this
energy
leave
your
body
with
each
exhale
Give
yourself
permission
to
go
further
into
your
relaxed
state
of
mind
Bring
your
awareness
to
your
heart
Feel
your
heart
beating
in
your
chest
with
each
bead
Reminding
you
that
you
're
alive
Happy
and
healthy
Inhale
And
exhale
Feel
your
eyes
become
heavy
Bring
your
awareness
to
that
space
between
your
two
eyebrows
your
third
eye
chakra
Notice
if
you
see
any
patterns
or
colors
appear
as
you
breathe
Simply
take
note
and
continue
to
breathe
Inhale
and
exhale
Let
go
of
any
thoughts
or
worries
give
yourself
permission
to
be
completely
one
with
your
breath
Become
the
watcher
of
your
thoughts
if
any
thoughts
or
ideas
start
to
rise
simply
accept
and
Then
let
them
go
Seeing
these
thoughts
drown
away
like
a
stone
sinking
to
the
bottom
of
the
lake
its
gently
let
go
Inhale
and
exhale
out
As
you
stay
here
with
your
breath
Let
's
introduce
our
mantra
focusing
on
this
mantra
,
or
simply
coming
back
to
it
whenever
you
notice
your
mind
starting
to
wonder
I
Surrender
to
the
path
of
my
own
journey
I
accept
and
embrace
the
process
I
Surrendered
to
the
path
of
my
own
journey
I
accept
and
embrace
the
process
I
Surrender
to
the
path
of
my
own
journey
I
accept
and
embrace
the
process
And
now
silently
in
your
mind
until
you
hear
soft
Bell
letting
you
know
it
's
time
to
release
the
mantra
It
's
time
to
release
the
mantra
Slowly
come
back
to
your
breath
Deepening
each
inhale
Along
getting
each
exhale
Give
yourself
permission
to
be
still
for
a
little
longer
Or
slowly
open
your
eyes
if
you
're
ready
as
you
move
on
with
your
day
today
Keep
this
intention
and
mantra
in
your
mind
accepting
all
that
comes
your
way
and
Opening
yourself
to
the
process
of
life
Knowing
that
no
matter
what
happens
it
will
all
work
out
the
way
,
it
's
meant
to
be
Surrender
spread
love
and
