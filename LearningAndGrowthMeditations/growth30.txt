mindfulness is a great way to increase
your ability to focus
so in this meditation we will combine
the two
allow yourself to get into a comfortable
seated position
spine tall and straight
sit bones balanced on either side
shoulders rolled back slightly to open
up your heart
and palms resting facing downwards in
your lap
when you feel ready softly close your
eyes
and turn your awareness inwards
begin to become more deeply aware of
your breath
belly and rib cage expand as you breathe
in
and contract as you breathe out
[Music]
as you focus on this breath
allow yourself to be the gentle observer
all throughout the course of this
meditation
whatever you are guided to focus on
allow yourself to simply gently observe
it
without any judgment
focusing on it with a sense
of kindness
compassion
and allowance
allowing whatever is to simply be
so right now
let's focus in specifically
on any sensations in your nose
what do you notice here as you breathe
focus all of your awareness in your nose
practicing being the observer
[Music]
now allow your focus to travel down into
your chest
[Music]
observing any sensations here
noticing what muscles you engage as you
breathe
[Music]
can you feel the sensation of clothes on
your skin here
stay focused
solely on this area
[Music]
practicing being the gentle observer
noticing what is here
with a sense of allowance
[Music]
[Music]
now focus in on your belly
[Music]
notice how it expands as you breathe in
and contracts as you breathe out
what else do you notice here
observing any feelings
outside your belly
and inside
[Music]
just noticing what is without any need
to change anything
practicing being the gentle observer
focusing on this one
place
[Music]
now shift your mindful awareness to your
hands
focusing all of your awareness
in your hands
perhaps feeling their temperature
any points of contact
[Music]
what else do you observe
[Music]
let whatever you notice
simply be
as all of your focus
rests here
[Music]
now let's practice focusing
with mindful awareness on the feet
what sensations do you notice here
both internally
and externally
letting all of your awareness focus on
your feet
accepting and allowing
whatever is here
to simply be
[Music]
now that you've practiced using
mindfulness to focus on several
different areas of your body
now allow yourself to choose
one particular area of your body to
focus on
go there now with your awareness
what do you notice here
observing sensations
[Music]
temperature
both any inner and outer
observations
staying completely focused on this one
particular area
what else do you notice
i will leave you now to stay mindfully
present with this space
allowing what is to simply be
as you gently observe it
with kindness and compassion
focusing all of your awareness here
[Music]
wonderful job focusing
begin to become aware of your body as a
whole
noticing the points of contact between
you and the surface on which you are
seated
and begin to rule your shoulders
really feeling
everything as you move them
begin to wiggle your fingers and toes
and when you're ready slowly
open your eyes back to the world around
you
[Music]
you
