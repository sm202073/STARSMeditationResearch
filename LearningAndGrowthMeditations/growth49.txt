welcome to today's gratitude meditation
today we are going to spend some time
appreciating the little things in life
a comfortable position with eyes closed
breathe deeply and just be here
for a moment
[Music]
feel the rise and the fall of your chest
as you breathe
feel where your body meets the surface
that you rest on
feel the faint beating of your heart
and understand that all of this is
something to be grateful for
you are breathing
you are persevering and you are taking
the time
out of your day to recognize the small
joys in life
practicing gratitude is essential
so many times in this world we are told
to ask for more strive
for more be more
but truthfully we have all that we need
within ourselves
breathe deeply and be here with this
idea
take a moment now to think of anything
that has made you smile recently
it could be a meal a funny joke that
brightened your day
or even a smile from a stranger
take note of how this thought feels in
your body
how the joy feels in your body
from the top of your head all the way
down
to the bottom of your body
take a moment now to think of any being
that has made you smile recently
it could be a friend a lover
an animal companion or even a stranger
take note of how this feels in your body
to think of this being
how the joy feels in your body
give thanks to this being your deepest
appreciation and feel the gratitude
spread outside of your body and
into the air around you
send your joy and your love
out to all that surrounds you
to your community
to the world
gratitude is like a seed it needs
water and care and when we practice
gratitude frequently we water the seed
we bloom
come back to your body now connecting
again with the gentle rise
and fall of your chest
feeling the air entering your lungs
and exiting your body
feeling where your body is in space
[Music]
you can move about in any way that feels
good
gently coming back to this moment
in this space
and whenever you are ready
slowly open your eyes
thank you for joining me today i am
grateful that you did
