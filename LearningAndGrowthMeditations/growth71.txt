Begin by getting into a comfortable
seated position
if it feels good to you adjust your
spine so that it feels tall and straight
[Music]
letting your sit bones be balanced and
even on either side
[Music]
rolling shoulders back slightly to open
up your heart
foreign
letting your palms rest facing open in
your lap
when you feel ready gently close your
eyes
and begin to turn your awareness inwards
let yourself get curious
as you start to explore without judgment
watch your breath feels like
noticing what muscles you are engaging
[Music]
noticing how deep or shallow the breath
feels
[Music]
what else do you notice foreign
just allowing whatever You observe to be
as it is
you may notice that as You observe your
breath
your breath starts to become more free
and uninhibited
perhaps your belly softens
[Music]
expanding more on every in-breath
perhaps Contracting more on every out
breath
As You observe the breath you really let
it be what it wants to be whatever this
is for you breath to breath foreign
[Music]
you may notice that some inhales are
longer
and some are shorter
whatever you witness
let it be okay as it is
[Music]
with your breath continuing to flow
however it's flowing
now bring your focus to the inside of
your left hand
[Music]
what do you notice as you focus here
and if this is not applicable to you
just imagine that it is
staying curious about any Sensations you
notice
without judging anything you notice
you just stay present with it
gently observing it
and asking nothing of it
foreign
perhaps the more you let your awareness
rest here
the more you notice
perhaps there is warmth
or tingling
or at the sensation of air
[Music]
whatever it is you let it be perfectly
okay exactly as it is
[Music]
now allow your awareness to drift to
your right hand
focusing again on the inside
the palm and the inside of the fingers
what do you notice
[Music]
what do you feel
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
now see if you can let your awareness
rest in both hands
just being present with them
without judgment
but instead with just a gentle curiosity
I will leave you now to practice this
now allow your awareness to flow down to
your left foot
again using your imagination if this is
not applicable to you
or choosing another spot
just let your awareness rest here
without judgment
just noticing whenever you notice
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
giving it judgment free attention
just observing
it allowing it to be whatever it feels
like being right now
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
letting your awareness rest within both
feet
gently observing
[Music]
thank you
nothing to judge nothing to consider
you are the gentle Observer
[Music]
foreign
breathe in extra deeply stomach and rib
cage fully expanding holding your breath
when you reach the top
and when you're ready exhale with a sigh
tune into how the soles of your feet and
the palms of your hands feel
[Music]
perhaps rubbing your hands together
thank you
[Music]
and then feeling the static in them when
you finish
saying thank you to your hands and feet
[Music]
and when you're ready slowly
open your eyes back to the world around
you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
