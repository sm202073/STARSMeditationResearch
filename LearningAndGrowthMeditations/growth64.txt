hello and welcome i'm sarah raymond from the mindful movement
allow my voice to guide you to relax completely as a deep
healing sleep easily comes to you [Music]
now i invite you to make yourself comfortable
take a moment and make sure your environment is all set for you to safely drift
into sleep invite into your body and mind
a sense of relaxation and peace
you can drift off to sleep when your body is ready
[Music] there is no need to hear everything i
say take a deep breath in
and as you breathe out gently close your eyes
let this simple action be a signal to your body
and mind that it is time to sleep
deeply and every time you hear my voice say the
words sleep deeply you can sense a peaceful sleep
easily and effortlessly coming to you
give yourself permission to let go of thoughts and glide
freely into sleep
begin to deepen your breath breathing into your belly
think of filling up all the way to the bottom of your abdomen
and each breath out is just as full
not only are your breaths becoming full in volume but full in depth as well
this deep breath pattern will create a spaciousness within you to
cultivate your inner fire
this fire within you is for awakening
for cleansing for growth [Music]
this focus on your breath encourages your breath to support your relaxation
even further [Music]
breathe in deeply directing your breath into your belly
now pause for a moment at the top
exhale fully and slowly
and then pause again following your exhale
again take a deep breath in filling your belly creating space
hold at the top for a moment then slowly breathe out
sensing your belly soften
after your exhale hold for just a second
and then begin again
continue taking a few more deep relaxing breaths at your own pace
as you continue to relax and settle into a deeply
sleepy state begin to see the image of a fire
in your mind
whatever image comes to mind is fine
this can be a campfire safely outside in the woods
or perhaps you see a fireplace in a cozy room inside
this may be a place you have been to before
or one that exists only in your mind
you may see this image as a still picture
or as if it is a movie playing in your head
if no images come to mind that is okay simply think of the idea of a fire
imagine all the details of this fire
see its color
feel its warmth and because this is your visualization
this fire is the perfect temperature for
you perhaps you can sense the smell
and hear the soft subtle sounds of this fire
keep this image in your mind and continue to relax deeper
as you become aware of your physical
sensations let the color and warmth of this fire
melt away any stress and tension as you slowly scan
your body
become aware of where your body makes contact
with the surface below you
let this connection ground you
feel this as support and give yourself permission to be
fully supported because now is your time
to sleep deeply
you are safe
use this sensation of where you and your support meet
to draw your attention gradually from your outer experience
to your inner world [Music]
move your awareness now to the soles of your feet
as you begin to scan your body
slowly moving your attention
upward let go and drift
effortlessly into peace
soften and relax each part of your body
as your focus flows from your feet
upward towards your head
feel the warmth loosen your lower legs
knees and thighs
allow the weight of your hips to sink heavily into the surface
below you [Music]
lessen the effort in the area of your belly
let your attention linger here for a moment longer
this is the area of your solar plexus chakra
the free flow of energy here is the place in your body where your
energy vitality desire
confidence and power reside
as you relax here you make space and encourage
this free flow of energy
soften your ribs and chest now
continue building a sense of tranquility throughout your neck
face and head
relax both arms completely all the way down to your fingers
[Music] scan through your body once more on your
own softening the outer layer of your
physical sensations to let go
and relax anywhere you can
welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind
encourage the weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface
below you so there is no need to hold on
you can simply let go and sleep deeply
now you are completely relaxed and at ease
you can begin to learn from the symbolism and wisdom of the element of fire
when your body is relaxed there is space
for dreams and possibilities to arise
you can more easily connect with your authentic self
and your true desires
in this peaceful state of rest you can stoke your inner fire
remember you can drift off to sleep when your body is ready
there is no need to listen to everything i say
my voice will speak softly and directly to your subconscious
freeing you from any limitations and at the same time building
vision creativity and strength from the fire within you
come back to the visualization of fire in your imagination
this fire represents the spiritual flame within you
[Music] fire represents passion and inspiration
what lights your fire
what brightens your desires
what shines a light on your heart
cultivate the fire within to inspire more of what sparks your passions
stoke your inner fire and enthusiasm
begin to visualize what you want your life to look like
and how you want to feel
be open to receive messages or ideas about what it is
you truly desire
listen to what your soul is sharing with you now
let these ideas come to you with
curiosity
recognize that your imagination is an extremely powerful tool
you can use this tool to develop something new to
shape your life the way that you desire
connect with the feelings of what you
desire
notice the positive emotions that arise from within
connect with these positive emotions
light your inner fire and become the person you want to be the person you're meant
to be
[Music]
remain connected with the positive excited state
of this visualization
keep the building energy of possibilities for the future within you
and now be mindful of a potential inner conflict
where part of you may be thinking you cannot have what you want
or that you don't deserve it
or that it is impossible
do not fight these thoughts simply acknowledge them rather than pushing
them away because they will continue to show up if
they are not recognized
no need to stay here too long without judgment let go of your past
beliefs that could be holding you back
fire is transformation and purification
it is this energy of transformation that allows you to be lifted out of
