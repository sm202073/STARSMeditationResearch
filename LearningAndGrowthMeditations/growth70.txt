[Music]
welcome this is Sarah Raymond thank you
for listening to the sky did meditation
to build a sense of appreciation and
gratitude for your body during this
meditation I invite you to deepen your
connection with your body love your body
for what it does for you daily without
being asked and without asking for
anything in return
love your body in spite of pain in spite
of imperfections and flaws love your
body is a vehicle for living the life
you wish and love your body as a means
to fulfill your passions and purpose in
this world our mind body soul and
emotions are one and our body speaks our
mind taking time to nurture your body
will support your mind and nurturing
your mind will support your body as well
if there is a part of your body that is
feeling pain or if your stress level is
high invite a sense of love and
gratitude into your body and mind as you
tend to each part to nurture yourself as
a whole during this meditation
[Music]
sometimes we unknowingly begin to
identify ourselves based on our pain or
physical limitations and by identifying
with these areas of dis-ease we can hold
ourselves back today be kind to yourself
think loving thoughts and love your body
let go of labels of past pain or disease
as well as limitations
[Music]
and now I invite you to make yourself
comfortable choose a position where you
can settle into effortless ease allow
your hands to rest easy and close your
eyes if you wish
maybe you feel drawn to deepen your
connection and would like to place your
left hand on your heart and your right
hand on your belly
choose whatever position is calling to
you
make the small subtle adjustments in
position and muscular tension to relax
completely
and now take a deep breath in through
your nose sending the breath all the way
down the length of your spine and
breathe out like a sigh through your
mouth releasing any residual stress or
tension
let's do this together one more time
deep breath in and sigh it out
feel your body soften and relax as you
enter the familiar state of relaxed
introspective awareness and allow your
breath to return to its automatic
pattern during this time that you have
set aside to care for yourself the world
will go on around you
there will be sounds around you and
thoughts that come into your mind simply
acknowledge them and allow them to be
part of the background as you invite
your awareness inward
bring your attention to your breath as
it flows in its natural rhythm without
changing or forcing any expectation of
what it should be
notice its path notice its tempo
and notice its fullness
perhaps your breath is beginning to slow
down and deepen as you relax
or maybe you feel the breath becomes
shallow or even pause momentarily
[Music]
whatever you're experiencing is perfect
simply be with the sensations as they
arise notice the movement of your body
connected to your breath rhythm
perhaps a rise and fall of the chest and
abdomen flowing in connection with each
inhale and exhale
continue to practice sensing the breath
for the next few moments of silence
lovingly returning your focus if the
mind follows a thought or sound into
story
inviting your attention now to move
slowly and deliberately to your physical
sensations begin at the top of your head
and scan the sensations of your body
from the inside with a fluid attention
all the way down to the soles of your
feet
as your attention passes over each part
of your body encourage a release
a letting go of any tension
once your awareness reaches your feet
bring it back to the top of your head
and begin again
this time notice any areas of pain or
discomfort and simply be with the
sensations without labeling or telling a
story of why breathe into these areas
and invite a sense of ease and release
notice if you skip over or avoid any
areas and as you scan or feel judgment
about a particular area
welcome anything and everything that you
are feeling and thank your body for its
ability to feel
[Music]
let go of past stories or expectations
you may have about your body simply send
love to your body
[Music]
as you continue this flowing body scan
practice begin to now bring a feeling of
loving-kindness as your attention moves
down your body feel a sense of gratitude
towards everything that your body does
for you automatically
thank your body for its ability to
digest food and turn it into fuel
thank your body for releasing toxins for
pumping blood for breathing and thinking
and allowing you to move around
[Music]
appreciate your body senses that allow
you to smell your favorite scent taste
delicious food see the beautiful sights
around you here are the most amazing
sounds and feel the soft touch of a
loved ones embrace
for each and every part of your body
gratitude and loving energy
feel every part of your body skin bones
organs and energy maybe even your heart
beating
you may find it difficult to send love
to an area of chronic pain or disease
that is okay do your best to be with
everything that is part of you pain is
still a part of you a part of you in
need of loving kindness continue sending
positive healing energy to those parts
[Music]
perhaps you are drawn to play the hand
on the area of pain or an area that
needs a little extra love
or imagine a healing light bringing
relief and positive energy to the areas
of discomfort stay with the sensations a
short while longer
and reflect on the amazing ability and
automatic functions of the body
send gratitude and love to each and
every part of your body your heart and
your soul
[Music]
the more connected to your body and
aware you become the more you see that
your body speaks your mind and it speaks
important messages if you are willing
and hoping to listen for the rest of
today and beyond practice loving your
body and listening to your body's
important messages
begin to deepen your breath to awaken
your relaxed body
bring some gentle movements to your
fingers and toes energizing your body
taking your time when you're ready open
your eyes
thank you so much for listening I hope
you have a wonderful day
