begin by getting in a comfortable seated
position
spine tall and straight
sit bones balanced shoulders rolled away
from the ears
opening up that beautiful heart of yours
letting your palms rest open in your lap
and lovingly close your eyes
tune into your breath and your body
becoming present
noticing how it feels as you breathe in
and out letting your belly and rib cage
expand on every in-breath
and contract on every out breath
as you tune into the weight of gravity
letting the muscles in your face relax
letting any muscles you do not need
right now
become loose with the weight of gravity
[Music]
then you tune in
to you
you say to yourself i am here with me
now
i choose to be my best friend
and to offer myself the gift that a
growth mindset brings
[Music]
feel this commitment to yourself in your
heart for truly a growth mindset is
a commitment it's not a one-time thing
[Music]
tune into your heart in the middle of
your chest and a couple of inches
inwards
[Music]
this is the energy center of your heart
and in here lies an eager happy
openness to committing to a growth
mindset
[Music]
do you feel that happiness your heart
is happy that you are open
to committing to a growth mindset
for it doesn't just affect your mindset
mentally
it affects your entire way of being
it affects your emotions your physical
body
and of course your mental wellness
as you tune into your heart you become
clear
why do you desire a growth mindset
why do you feel it will serve you
who do you wish to become
[Music]
as you tune in to your desire in your
heart to become the best
version of you you take a nice deep
breath in stomach and ribcage fully
expanding
holding your breath at the top letting
this desire to be the best version of
you build
and when you're ready exhale with a sigh
[Music]
you tune in to that desire to
grow to be open to feedback
to be committed to you
and you let that desire flow
as you breathe in and out
and listen to these words as they spark
more desire within you
[Music]
and start to even
turn from desire into
action for you feel open
and knowing that the more you listen to
the following messages
the more you will start to shift into
a growth mindset
keep breathing
and listen to these words
and let them move you
[Music]
you are responsible for your thoughts
yes the world around you has
influenced you in some way but
it ultimately is up to you to decide
what
is true to you
you create your reality with the beliefs
you have
and the beliefs you have are
just thoughts you've been thinking over
and over
[Music]
you have the power to think new thoughts
every time a thought occurs that
you wonder does this serve me
if the answer is no you can choose
a new thought
much like attending to a garden that
perhaps has been long overlooked
for years and years and there are many
weeds
and tangled roots
it takes time to pull out
what's no longer needed in that garden
the weeds may keep growing back time and
time again
but the more you tend to the garden the
more you plant
the seeds you wish to see in the garden
the more your garden becomes that which
you desire it to be
it takes daily work and daily
cultivation
the same is true with your mind
and when you become the gardener of your
mind
you become a master at growth mindset
because you know you can change
the landscape of your mind masterfully
you can curate it to be whatever you
wish it to be
you become open to feedback from others
you become non-resistant because you
know that
everything you see witness here
you are the one who ultimately decides
whether or not you keep it
[Music]
whether or not it is part of the garden
you wish to
[Music]
cultivate
in the past perhaps you have
allowed yourself to feel triggered
by someone's words or actions and
perhaps you thought that was a bad
thing now
as the gardener of the landscape in your
mind you recognize
that any time you feel triggered
it's quite similar to stumbling upon a
patch of
bittersweet in the garden this is an
invasive species
that can choke out the other plants
instead of viewing it as a bad thing
you now with your growth mindset simply
view it as something to take care of
when you focus on what you would rather
see
and stand
you allow yourself to remove that which
doesn't serve
and you only view that which doesn't
serve as
guidance versus a bad thing
you are the gardener of the landscape of
your mind
continually shaping molding and
cultivating beliefs and views that serve
you
it is a daily commitment
feel in your heart how committed you are
as you affirm to yourself i cultivate
the landscape of my mind
i choose a growth mindset every time i
am faced
with anything i view as an obstacle
or bad
i choose to curate thoughts and beliefs
that serve me
[Music]
i'm open to growth and commitment to
growth now
take a nice big deep breath in stomach
and rib cage fully expanding holding
your breath
at the top and when you're ready exhale
with a sigh
[Music]
take this feeling and commitment with
you as you begin to roll your shoulders
wiggle your fingers and toes and when
you're ready
slowly open your eyes back to the world
around you
[Music]
now go out there as the gardener of your
inner landscape of your mind
and enjoy cultivating the thoughts and
beliefs you wish
to see
you
