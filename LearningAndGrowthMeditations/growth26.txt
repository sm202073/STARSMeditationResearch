hey guys it's hi welcome back to my
youtube channel
and today we are going to be doing a
guided meditation on passing your exams
and getting good grades
after watching this video you will come
out with amazing perfect straight a's
and a hundred percent on all of your
exams you take further on
the first thing that i want you to do
is get into a comfortable position
you can be sitting you can be laying
down
whatever is comfortable for you right
now
once you're in that position
i want you to close your eyes
now we're going to be focusing on our
breathing
i want you to breathe in
one two three
and breathe out
one
two
three
again breathe in
one two three
and breathe out
one two
three
breathe in
breathe out
breathe in
breathe out
for the next few seconds i want you to
focus on your breathing
every time you breathe in i want you to
feel your lungs filling up with air
with every exhale i want your body to
fall into whatever position you are
sitting or laying in
with every exhale i want you to become
more and more relaxed
[Music]
i'm going to count to 10
feel free to follow along
or just to continue to focus on your
breathing
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
and ten
now that we're relaxed
we're going to start focusing on
getting into the feeling of the wish
fulfilled
i want you to visualize
being in whatever room you would be in
if you were taking a test
or an exam
or doing your schoolwork
i want you to place yourself
in that situation
what are you seeing
maybe a classroom
maybe a computer in front of you
what are you seeing
next i want you to visualize yourself
being completely
utterly confident in your abilities to
do perfectly on this assignment
what are you feeling
maybe you're feeling overly cocky or
confident
maybe you're feeling like this is super
super
easy what are you feeling
[Music]
now i want you to visualize a few days
or weeks later
you're sitting in the same spot
and you finally receive your test score
or your assignment grade
immediately you are so excited
maybe you visualize yourself getting up
and jumping around
or maybe you visualize looking to your
friend to the left of you
saying how excited you are that you got
a 100 percent on this assignment
[Music]
what are you feeling right now
are you feeling proud of yourself
are you feeling excited
[Music]
maybe you're feeling relieved
what are you
feeling i want you to sit on this
feeling for a few more seconds
and really try to feel yourself being
there
now we're going to focus a little bit on
the past
we're going to revise that you have only
ever gotten straight a's
you have never been a bad student
you have always done perfectly on any
exam that you have taken
any score below 100 does not belong to
you
repeat after me
all assignments are extremely easy for
me
being a good student comes naturally for
me
i never have to stress about getting
good grades because i've never gotten a
bad grade in my life
[Music]
every assignment i do
i get a perfect score
i'm the smartest person i know
everything i do i'm good at
things come very easy for me
i get perfect scores without spending
hours studying
school has always been super easy for me
[Music]
i'm going to give you the next few
minutes to just sit down
and repeat affirmations
or visualize
do whatever you want
but from now on you are a star student
you have only ever gotten a's
and from now forward every exam you take
you will pass easily
[Music]
[Music]
as we're reaching the end of this guided
meditation
i want you to start wiggling your toes
when you're ready
and then wiggling your fingers
waking your body up a little bit more
when you're ready
open your eyes
and you are done
from now on
you are an amazing student
you only ever get perfect scores
that is it for today's meditation thank
