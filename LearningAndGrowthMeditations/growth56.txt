welcome to today's guided meditation
make yourself comfortable
your spine erect with your legs crossed
be seated in a chair with your feet
firmly planted on the ground
or you can be laying down on your bed or
on your floor
whatever works for you
place your hands in your lap
your right hand on top of your left the
thumbs touching
or have your palms facing up all fingers
together and place them on your knees
if you're laying down place both your
palms facing up
on either side
[Music]
now close your eyes and take a deep
inhale
[Music]
take a moment to settle into your body
as you relax in this peaceful state
allow your mind to drift as you listen
to my words
take an inhale
and relax your body even more now
and whenever you're ready
let's begin today's meditation
[Music]
take a moment to think of three clear
intentions that you want for your life
right now
take a beautiful
inhale inhale through your nose
and slowly exhale through your nose
be clear on those three intentions as we
move into this meditation
[Music]
anytime your mind starts to wonder
bring it back to those intentions
and as we continue focus on your breath
focus on the air and the flow of your
breath
let it rise and fall
and notice any tension in your body
allowing it to melt away
[Music]
and as we start to go deeper and deeper
into this meditation
bring your focus
to your breathing
we're going to take a moment to
visualize a beautiful bright light
right in between your mind's eye
[Music]
allow this beautiful bright warm light
to expand
allow it to grow bigger
[Music]
visualize it filling up the room
this beautiful warm bright light
take a moment now to think of those
three intentions
[Music]
allow them to come in and immerse
and lay into your subconscious mind
[Music]
just explore this feeling
explore these intentions as they start
to become clearer and clearer for you
notice what you're experiencing
allow these intentions to come through
this beautiful bright light
let them be embedded into your
subconscious mind
allow them to settle deep into your
subconscious
[Music]
keep breathing
[Music]
so you're clear in the direction of
where you're going
take a moment now to
visualize the feeling of these goals
being manifested into your life
how does it feel
allow yourself to sit in the space
a space of immense gratitude
these incredible goals are unfolding
your goals are coming to fruition
as you explore your future
what sensations are coming up
take a moment to observe now
as you visualize your intentions
[Music]
take a few minutes
and just visualize
visualize your intentions
and observe your feelings in the moment
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
now that you've relished in the
sensation of achieving these goals
allow the
beautiful bright light
to gently start to come towards the body
and as this warm light
is coming back into your mind's eye
remind yourself
that you have the power to achieve
anything and everything you desire in
this life
the beautiful light is getting smaller
and smaller
and is now closing over
now take a moment
to take a deep breath in
and slowly exhale through your nose
[Music]
bring the awareness back into your body
now
keep breathing
[Music]
and with a smile on your face because
you know that your intentions are
manifested
and you know and believe that these
intentions are within you
and you feel the gratitude in your heart
in your entire body
bring your palms together at your heart
center in namaste
and whenever you're ready
open up your eyes
[Music]
and come back
[Music]
and with my love and prayers
namaste
namo himalia
[Music]
you
