feeling
your best begin this meditation by
sitting up tall and straight
letting your spine lengthen feeling as
though you have an invisible thread
tugging at the top of your head and
pulling you upwards
let your hands rest comfortably in your
lap
and gently close your eyes
focus all of your awareness on your
breath
[Music]
letting your stomach and rib cage expand
on
every inhale and contract
on every exhale
[Music]
let yourself drop into your body by
being present with the sensation
of your breath
[Music]
feel the air as it flows in
and out
[Music]
tune in to how grateful you are for the
air that is entering your lungs
as it fuels you with vital energy
[Music]
[Music]
you begin to feel this sensation this
liberation
this feeling of being alive
[Music]
and with this liberating feeling
coursing through you
you become aware of a tall mountain just
in front of you
[Music]
there are stone steps carved out of the
mountain leading up
beyond the clouds
you set the intention to climb this
mountain
knowing in your heart that as you reach
the top
your body heart mind and soul
will all feel healthy calm and at their
best
[Music]
on your next inhale you begin your first
initial steps
and on your next exhale you climb a few
more
on each and every inhale and exhale you
continue this process
and you effortlessly begin to scale the
mountain
[Music]
you feel yourself lifting up rising to
the top
[Music]
continuing to breathe in
and out
[Music]
almost reaching the clouds now you
notice your body and mind
feeling more invigorated stronger
[Music]
healthier
[Music]
as you pass through the clouds you rise
up into a clear blue sky
and see a golden mountain top
you stand directly in the center of a
healing circle of golden light
at the top of the mountain
[Music]
as you feel the warmth of the sun
beaming down upon your shoulders you
take a deep breath
in and hold it at the top
tune in to how good and invigorated you
feel as you hold this breath
and when you're ready exhale with a sigh
[Music]
up at the top of this mountain you align
with the energy of feeling your best
tune into how this feels in your body
heart mind and soul
feel it now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let it grow and expand
as you breathe in
and out
[Music]
carry this feeling with you as you begin
to become aware of your body in this
moment
[Music]
tuning in to how great it feels
[Music]
carrying forward the sensation of
feeling your best
as you begin to wiggle your fingers and
toes
and slowly open your eyes
back to the room around you feeling
strong
healthy vibrant and full of life
you
