begin by sitting in a comfortable
position
palms in your lap facing open
lovingly close your eyes
and turn your awareness inwards towards
your breath
let your belly expand as you breathe in
and contract as you breathe out
letting it feel natural
fluid effortless
as you feel yourself dropping into your
body
you become more aware of this present
moment
you begin to give yourself the gift
of peace that comes from being
in the present moment
if throughout the course of this
practice you find your mind wandering
that's okay be gentle on yourself
if that happens just return
to your breath your body
and the words you are hearing
there is nothing you need to do right
now
[Music]
it's safe for you to let go
[Music]
to relax
it is safe for you to simply
be
and in your own presence
in the comfort of your own presence
you recognize that you are limitless
bound only by your own imaginings
[Music]
instead of imagining any sort of form
of self-restriction
today marks the day that you choose to
use your imagination
wisely creatively
confidently and
guided by and infused by love
you have the power to create
and control to mold and shape
your thoughts and emotions
it may take time and patience
but you can love yourself through the
shaping and the molding
you can love and accept yourself as you
are
in the process of refining
and re-honing your skills
and your ability to be adept
at choosing your beliefs and your
reality
[Music]
beliefs are simply thoughts you've been
thinking
over and over
and your beliefs create your reality
so tune in to how it feels within you to
recognize
that you have the power to change your
beliefs
and therefore change your reality and
therefore
truly be limitless
you are limitless
tune in to what this does for you tune
in to what this statement makes you
feel
[Music]
that part of you who knows you are free
and that part of you may feel like
singing inside of you
that part of you knows the truth of your
limitless nature
[Music]
you are so limitless you can choose
to perceive limitations
but you know
moving forward you will choose to
perceive
possibilities whether
once were limitations
for ultimately that viewpoint is yours
you are so powerful you can choose your
own perspective and in fact you
already always are
you already always
are
while you may not be able to control the
outside world
you are the
ruler of your internal world
you are the ruler
you can reign with love
on your own thoughts and emotions and
beliefs
helping nurture and guide yourself
creating the beliefs you wish to have
honoring and respecting everything about
yourself
even the parts you wish to change for
you know
as the ruler of your internal landscape
that those parts of you are just
teachers
they're just opportunities to realign
and reconnect with what you desire
you are so powerful
you have the power to shape your
thoughts
and therefore shape your destiny
you can rule over your mind
heart and emotions with love
[Music]
with a sense of compassion
respect
clarity
[Music]
and ease
your body heart and mind can flow
as one in harmony
[Music]
can flow as one in harmony with
love
[Music]
indeed this is your birthright
you are reconnecting to it now
it is as you are meant to be
[Music]
and every day you must commit
to returning to this love
commit to returning to this power to
shape your thoughts
and therefore shape your beliefs
it's your responsibility to commit
to loving and honoring yourself and you
are
so capable
[Music]
for you can love and honor yourself even
in the midst of any
situation
[Music]
you are capable of this
[Music]
it is essentially a returning home
to your truth
that you are limitless
bound by only your imagination
[Music]
let your imagination set you free
take a deep breath in stomach and rib
cage fully expanding
holding your breath when you reach the
top and as it feels good to you
exhale with a sigh
and begin to roll your shoulders
wiggle your fingers and your toes
perhaps stretch your neck a little side
to side
and when you feel ready take your time
as you open your eyes back to the world
around you
recognizing any limitations you perceive
are just that a perception
and nothing more
[Music]
you are incredible thank you so much for
being here
[Music]
you
