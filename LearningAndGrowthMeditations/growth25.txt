if it's comfortable for you let's begin
by taking a gentle deep breath
in through the nose
and out through the mouth
and with that exhalation adopting a
comfortable posture of awareness
returning the breath to its natural
rhythm
and allowing your attention to gently
drop into this present moment
and without turning or looking around
just lightly bringing into your
awareness all that's in your surrounding
space
and with your next out breath allowing
your focus to fall onto one specific
object that's in your field of vision
and it's not an intense stare
so just maintaining it as a very soft
focus
and this is a gentle practice so if at
any point the eyes become fatigued
allowing yourself to gently close them
for a moment or two and then reopening
them
nice and easy
noticing as any thoughts come and go
and just returning the attention back to
your object
and now letting the focus zoom back out
again
being aware of your surroundings
perhaps blinking a few times
allowing this cultivated focus to follow
you into your next activity
[Music]
you
