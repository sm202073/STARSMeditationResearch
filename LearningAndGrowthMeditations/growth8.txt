[Music]
begin by sitting in a comfortable
position
whatever that looks like for you
lovingly close your eyes
and tune in to your breath
and your body
taking a moment to really pause here
and focus on your breath
letting your belly expand as you breathe
in
followed by your ribcage
and contract as you breathe out
let yourself
deepen your awareness of your breath and
body
[Music]
feel the weight of gravity
[Music]
and let yourself
be here
right now
begin to feel genuine appreciation and
thankfulness to yourself
as you feel yourself becoming more
present
and relax into that presence
let it be natural and simple
it simply is
just as you simply are
and as you feel your body
relax
[Music]
we are transported
to a tropical beach
there are palm trees rustling in the
wind
and smooth
clear
steady water
you can see through it perfectly all the
way to the sand at the bottom
and it's as if the weight of gravity
keeps you anchored down
as you walk on the soft sand into the
water
submersing yourself fully
[Music]
feeling the flow of the water around
your body
encompassing you
in a loving sensation
as you walk further down
surrounded by love
[Music]
until you reach a pausing point
where you find a treasure chest
glowing
at the depths of the water
you effortlessly walk up to it with a
sense of awe and
wonder there's a question mark on the
top of the box
notice what question you have within you
right now
trust that question and say thank you to
it
and now open the box
and find your answer inside
it emerges as something symbolic to you
right now
allow yourself to receive the answer
fully
and say thank you
trusting your imagination and
intuition trusting yourself
with this box now clear with the
exception of a
thin film of gold sparkling and
glittering inside of it
you allow yourself
to enter
this treasure box making it as
comfortable as you'd like
if this means you need to make it as big
as a house go ahead and do so
[Music]
now that you are inside the treasure box
[Music]
with the gold glittering all around you
[Music]
allow yourself to breathe in the
glittering gold energy
receiving it into your cells
into your dna
receiving it all around
above
below
to the sides of your body the back the
front
this golden light streams in from
everywhere
entering in
fully encompassing you
[Music]
feel it uplifting your energy
and now a mirror appears within this
treasure box
and so you walk over to the mirror and
smile at your reflection
[Music]
you fully see in this moment
you are
your treasure
[Music]
this visualization you give yourself an
embrace where you place your hands on
your heart
you are welcome to do so physically in
this meditation if you wish
or just continue to imagine it
either way really tune into the
sensation of holding yourself
of honoring yourself
of viewing yourself
as your greatest treasure
[Music]
gazing into your own
magnificent eyes
you say out loud or in your mind
thank you
[Music]
and you watch as if some other aspect of
you that is non-physical
emerges from your physical body
this is your inner being
your highest self
see them in the mirror now
standing beside you
trust your imagination
whether they appear as
human or just as energy whatever you
notice
allow that to be
and more importantly than appearance
become aware
of their energy
feel how they are flowing love your way
feel how when they look at you in the
mirror
they see the most magnificent being
[Music]
they see
a human who is worthy of love
joy
all the things that they desire
[Music]
they pass you a pair of glasses
and they say that when you put these on
you will view yourself the way your
inner being does
this
will help you with your spiritual growth
when you feel ready
place the glasses on yourself
and look at your reflection
see yourself the way your source the way
our inner being sees you
capable
strong
[Music]
loving
wise
eternal
on the right path
what else
do you see and feel
say thank you to your inner being
feel them reconnect with you
take a deep breath in stomach and rib
cage fully expanding holding your breath
at the top gazing into your eyes in the
reflection
and when you're ready exhale with a sigh
as your breath returns to its regular
pace of breathing
you feel so deeply loved held and
supported trusting and knowing you are
indeed
your own treasure
you are capable of viewing yourself
through the eyes of your inner being
through the eyes of love
this tool moving forward
will greatly help you with your
spiritual growth
view yourself through the eyes of your
source
trust and know
you are loved
all is well
and you are on the right path
you perfect treasure you
[Music]
imagine yourself transporting back to
where you are right now
in this present moment
feeling your sit bones
feeling your arms rolling your shoulders
wiggling your fingers and toes
and when you're ready
take your time
as you open your eyes
back to the world around you
taking this feeling with you
everywhere you go throughout the rest of
your day
