hello and welcome to day 10 of the expand  meditation program today is a wonderful  
day not only because it's the last day of  the program and you made it through the  
entire program so far but it's also the beginning  and continuation of your own meditation journey  
maybe you have found those last 10 days  really hard and it was very hard for you to  
sit down find time to practice or maybe you found  it very easy and it felt all really good for you  
no matter how the experience was know that there  is no bad meditation so you showed up for yourself  
and you did the work which is all that counts  usually we have a next steps video at the end of  
every single one of our programs but this can  all be summarized in today's video and of course  
the message that we want to send to you is to  keep going keep showing up really just don't  
stop every single day is a new opportunity to  connect to yourself to learn more about yourself  
to connect to stillness within and you do that  through your meditation practice so although the  
program ends today we highly encourage you that  you continue again tomorrow with day one and just  
keep repeating the program we strongly encourage  you to follow the program and go through it  
for at least 30 days so two or three times more  through the full program so that you really have  
established a solid habit and something that you  can rely on in the flow of life you can always  
come back to this practice it will help you ground  it will help you lift you up no matter what life  
is throwing at you you always have your practice  to come back to to reconnect only because your  
experience of this program was a certain way  for the last 10 days doesn't mean that it has  
to continue like this for the next 10 days or for  the next whatever how many days it could be that  
the experience was so far challenging and the  next 10 days will be super easy and smooth and  
you feel incredibly good it could also be that you  felt really good throughout the last 10 days the  
next 10 days will be very challenging know that  this is completely normal that the meditation  
progress is not really linear it comes in  different stages and there's ups and downs and  
the important part is to not compare your  meditation practice and experience as it  
is today to something that was a while ago  sometimes even when you're meditating for  
many years it could be that at a certain time in  a certain stage it feels like you just started  
out again and you feel like the meditations that  you did several years ago but know that this is  
all part of the growth and part of the process  so the reminder here to just trust the process  
keep showing up and treat every meditation  independently enjoy every meditation as it  
is and as it unfolds each day when you are ready  to begin grab your pillow set everything up find  
a comfortable seat take a few deep breaths  and whenever you're ready close your eyes
take the next few breaths or  so to connect to your body
notice what you're sitting on the  connection and support to and from the earth
from there lengthen upwards through the spine
in the beginning of your meditation  when you just sat down it's the time  
to readjust to move around so that you can  sit effortlessly throughout this practice
this helps to set you up right in the beginning  so that you can be as still as possible
throughout your session establish  that connection to your breath that is  
it has become so familiar  now over the last 10 days
because you continue to show up every day to  sit down and feel the breath feel yourself
feel the life force that is  included in the air you take in
that keeps all the systems  going that keeps you going
as well as the plants and animals and all  the other earthlings on this beautiful planet
we all breathe the same air
you all see the same sun
the same moon feel the same rain
mother nature is ultimately what connects us all
that connects all beings
that means reconnecting to mother nature
is reconnecting to everything  it's reconnecting to life
reconnecting to yourself each and every day as  you sit down perhaps for the rest of your life
by really making
your meditation practice
a really solid part of your day
it is through that that you discover more  about yourself you discover more about
everything and everyone around you
and you can bring more quality into all  the actions you do throughout the day
continue to lean back into that pure  awareness where you observe the breath
if distractions come up let them be
and let them go
treat yourself with kindness that you noticed
and refocus on the breath
there are three qualities of awakened doing
with awakening being the realization  that you are not your thoughts
but instead your being your true  self is separate from the thoughts
it is which has the ability to observe the  thoughts those three doings are acceptance
which is you being fully present  surrendering and accepting to what is
it might seem like a passive  action or you being passive
but it's not to be confused with not
caring it is actively choosing to be okay  with something that's currently going on
although your first instinct  or reaction or from the outside
it seems like
not such a good thing whatever is coming  your way in life through presence you accept
you're accepting life
the second awaken doing is
enjoyment enjoyment is not something inward  
flowing towards you it's not something  found in the activities or in the doing
or in the work
or in your surrounding
it's from the deep connection to yourself within
that you feel this enjoyment and let it grow
so that it then is outward flowing from  within outwards into whatever you're doing
the doing itself
is the purpose of the doing
not to reach any goal or anything you're  working towards that is helpful but secondary
the act of doing right now is all that counts
the third modality of awakened doing
is enthusiasm
it is you finding joy and fulfillment
in your actions so much so that
you are just really excited about it all
your enthusiasm is so strong that you  cannot wait to do more of what you're doing
because you enjoy doing it
if you recognize any of these three in your life
then the awakening process has already started
where you go deeper and deeper  to yourself to life to nature
at this point you cannot stop the process anymore
you can only delay it
and by establishing a meditation practice daily
you can cultivate those  qualities let them grow go deeper
the plant has already started to grow
maybe you see a little bit of it already maybe  not if you continue to show up to meditate  
to breathe to be
you are watering that plant
as you continue your meditation  practice over the next days weeks
months and years
imagine how much this can transform you  imagine how much this can transform your life
your relationships your work
all this enjoyment and all this quality  outward flowing into everything else  
around you but coming from deep within it's  important to reconnect to that source within
as often as possible
maybe someday
you don't have to reconnect anymore  
because you are constantly in this state  of connection this is the true liberation
also called moksha
but it's all about feeling it within
you feel it a little bit within yourself  you felt that spark the process has started  
continue to show up day  after day to water the plants
let it grow
and enjoy
enjoy what is unfolding
notice the air coming in through the nose
and out to the nose
the breath is always with you
there are many opportunities  for you throughout the day
to feel it to reconnect
to take a few minutes of breathing in and  out nice and slow there is no upper limit to  
how many times you can reconnect throughout  the day in addition to your daily meditation
practice
if you're waiting in line if you're  waiting for the train or for your taxi
consider just sitting down or standing
eyes open or closed and breathe
just for a minute maybe for five
it's about this reconnection several  times throughout the day which  
will really rewire your brain
and create stronger connections
of love peace
relaxation presence
and authenticity
the journey has just begun you know the door
and it's up to you to go through it
to continue this practice
the path will appear as you walk it
day after day step by step
feel the connection to the earth again
length now to the spine
when you feel ready bring your palms  together bring the hands to the heart
to be so so proud of yourself for  showing up over the last 10 days
sitting down to practice to reconnect that  space within you has always been there  
but it's sometimes covered up
this is why we come back to the practice  to sit reconnect to who you truly are
from here on it's up to you  what you make of this journey
but you are worth it to go deep to feel the  love for yourself for others to be happy
to be at ease
i wish you the best of luck  love and support on your journey
thank you very much for practicing with us today
with love and gratitude
