pneuma breath connecting you with god [Music]
how great is our lord who saves us
who desires us let us begin this session with prayer
we honor you father glorious king of all things
we declare we love you we desire you and we love you because
you first loved us may you have your way with this session
and with our lives in jesus name
let's begin our breathing deep breath
slow exhale
deep breath
slow exhale
deep breath
slow exhale
now on your own breathe as you desire
i believe the lord wants us to fully consecrate ourselves to him
romans 12 1 says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god
that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god
which is your reasonable service we are going to set apart every part of
our body today beginning with our feet
as you sit there or stand with your eyes closed
begin to visualize your feet begin to focus on your feet
sensations your feet are feeling how the ground feels under your feet
just take in every little sense associated with your feet
as you breathe in a relaxed manner
let us now consecrate our feed for the lord's service
you can say lord jesus i give my feet to you
i give them for your service and your pleasure have your way with
them now begin to visualize jesus coming to
you and washing your feet like he did to his 12 disciples
at the last supper begin to see him washing your feet
preparing them for his service and for his glory
let us move on now to the hands
you can lift your hands up about chest high
now begin to visualize your hands hone in on every sense every finger
how your hands feel the air touching the outside of your hands
maybe blood flowing in and out of your fingers take some time now to really focus
on your hands
i want you now to visualize your hands being laid upon an elderly individual
and i want you to say lord i give my hands for your service
have your way with them and now begin to see
life virtue power from jesus flowing from you
through your hands into that elderly individual go ahead
and do that right now
now see that old individual begin to turn young
because of that virtue coming forth through you and say thank you lord
that where my hands go life goes because of you go ahead
very good now the heart
i want you to put your hand on your heart and begin to see your heart visualize
your heart does your heart feel like what
sensations does your heart give go ahead
in a nice relaxing breathing way begin to look at your heart
now begin to examine your heart what state is your heart
how do you feel in your relationship to god concerning your heart take some time now
to examine your heart
i want you now to visualize the lord jesus placing his hands on your heart
and imparting life and light to your heart and as he's doing so tell him
my heart belongs to you i give my heart to you lord
go ahead
how about we take some time now and just thank him you can lift your hands up to heaven if
you like you can speak audibly or inwardly
but how about we just thank him for everything he's done so far thank you jesus
thank you lord
thank you lord let's move now to your mind
to your head and let's first consecrate
our thoughts to the lord i would like you now to place your hand
on your forehead maybe your whole hand or a few fingers
and just begin to say thoughts come into alignment
with the kingdom of god
thoughts come into alignment with jesus christ
now just begin to visualize all your thoughts all the noise the ideas
the concerns the worries the memories
and just visualize them swirling all together
and then coming into the hand of jesus right into his right hand
go ahead
the bible says be transformed by the renewing of your mind
and bringing all thoughts into captivity to the obedience of jesus christ
this is a continuous discipline
giving our thoughts to him bringing our mind into alignment
with him allow me now just to bless your mind and
your thoughts father i thank you now for whoever is
listening or reading come now and bless their mind
lord i bless their mind and i say thoughts be subject to jesus christ
anxious thoughts be put away past memories and future concerns that
are out of order be put away be bound in jesus name
now let's go to your eyes with your eyes closed i want you to
visualize jesus coming to you by faith and laying his hands upon your eyes
i like you to say lord allow my eyes to see you
allow my eyes to see you lord
in everything now just watch him touch in your eyes
and feel the feelings that he brings
what do you feel he is doing what do you feel he wants your eyes to
see maybe scales are falling off
maybe you can see him clear let's take a little bit more time and
allow the lord to touch your eyes
let us see now thank you lord for giving me eyes to see
may my eyes be used for your glory
let's move now to the nose why the nose smell
is important otherwise god would not have given us the sense of smell
the bible speaks about a fragrance of life
i want us now to consecrate our very noses for the lord's use
as funny as that may sound go ahead and consecrate your nose to the lord
i would like you now to visualize the lord in his glory and begin to
breathe through your nostrils nice and slowly but by faith visualize breathing
in the fragrance of jesus christ the king go ahead
what are you feeling what are you experiencing
some of you may actually smell something others may feel the smell of his glory
regardless smell is something the lord has made
for us to have and it can be given to him for his glory let us now say
lord my nose for your glory
my nose for your glory
thank you lord let us now move to the ears
the bible says he that has ears let him hear what the spirit says to the churches
let us now give our ears to the lord
you can place your hands on your ears and you can say these words
lord i give you my ears for your glory my ability to hear
for your glory go ahead
i believe the lord would like you to know that this is an important one they're all
important but i believe there is an emphasis on the ability to hear from him
so now i want you now with your eyes closed to visualize
the lord breathing upon your ears
breathing away the dust breathing away the coldness
just see him breathing upon your ears even now clearing the way so that you may hear
his voice go ahead visualize by faith the lord
blowing on your ears
i feel glad to pray for your ears right now
lord for whoever is listening or reading right now i bless their ears
ears i speak to you be opened to the voice of the good shepherd
be opened to the spirit of christ to the spirit of god now
in jesus name i want you now to visualize your ears
being opened greater and greater openings to the
voice of god by faith go ahead and visualize that
please
thank you lord our ears for your glory
let us move now to the mouth
with the tongue we can curse men or we can bless
so much power in words
let us now just put our hands maybe one hand right on the mouth
just begin to say my mouth
for the lord my mouth for the lord
to speak blessing and not cursing
to bless men and not to damn
i would like you now to tilt your head back just a bit just gently
open up your mouth a little bit visualize the lord pouring into your
mouth pure holy clean
water as if he's pouring a pitcher clay pitcher of the most beautiful hero
water from heaven right into your mouth go ahead
thank you lord you can begin to clap your hands and
just thank him and in your own words just begin to say
lord my whole being consecrated to you for your service
any words you want to say from your own heart your own mouth just begin to say my being
for your glory my life for your service go ahead
in closing allow me to speak a blessing upon you
father thank you for how good you are
we we're simply children trying to pursue you daddy lord i speak blessing right now
upon my brother or my sister and i declare life and just fullness of joy
o album he blessed them by the power of your wonderful holy spirit and may they grow closer to
you in these days to come closer and closer and closer
