thought bubbles
this mindfulness practice will help you
to control your thoughts
sit comfortably in your chair
or on the floor
whichever your teacher prefers
[Music]
each day we have thousands of thoughts
scientists say we have at least one
thought every two seconds
that's at least 40 000 thoughts a day
[Music]
some of those thoughts are ideas some
are memories
things we learn
or opinions
our minds are amazing and thinking is
what makes humans so great
but sometimes we get too many thoughts
in our heads
and this can make us feel worried
tired or even angry
imagine that thoughts are like bubbles
they pop into your head
they grow and float around for a couple
of seconds and then pop
and disappear
some thoughts don't pop and go away
though
they keep growing and stay floating
around your mind for days
these big thought bubbles are usually
questions that cause us to worry
such as
who will play with me at playtime
what are they whispering about
will i get an invite to the birthday
party
mindfulness helps us to blow away some
of those bubbles that we don't need
we don't need to worry
it doesn't help with anything
having fewer thought bubbles clears your
mind and makes space for learning new
things at school
listen to the quiet music and breathe
normally
when you see a thought bubble come into
bertie brain's mind
then do a deep breath to blow it away
remember
when we do deep breaths
just your belly should be moving not
your shoulders
continue breathing normally
and listen to the music
[Music]
we shouldn't hear your breath because
this means you're breathing too quickly
well done
now for the last minute
listen to the quiet music
and when a thought comes into your head
do a deep breath to blow it away
just like we did for bertie brain
[Music]
[Music]
it might be a memory or a question that
pops into your head
focus again on the music
[Music]
well done
you should now feel more in control of
your thoughts
you can do this technique whenever you
feel like you have too many thoughts in
your head
