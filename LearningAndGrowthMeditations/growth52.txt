meditation for recreating yourself and
your life this meditation is based upon
the teachings of dr. Joe Dispenza and
our traditions and philosophies of the
Eastern world by practicing this
meditation you will be more and more
aligned with your intentions and goals
unable to release negative thoughts
negative emotions patterns habits and
addictions that prevent you from
manifesting the reality and the life
that you want
so let's begin
find a comfortable place where you can
either sit or lay down
close your eyes
and begin to disconnect from your
environment disconnecting from the
sounds around you the objects around you
bringing your attention and your energy
inward
becoming aware of the space inside of
you in space
the space inside your head in space
the space inside your neck in space
the space inside your chest in space
the space inside your abdomen in space
the space inside your whole body from
head to toes in space
the space around your body in space
feeling yourself dissolving within the
emptiness the blackness of space
empty
empty
as you continue to dissolve in space
floating
in the darkness of space
maybe you become aware of some thoughts
or emotions
that tie you back to the past
to the image of who you've believed
yourself to be
and these thoughts are tied to different
memories people places times in your
life
and as each and every one of these farts
or emotions that tie you to the past
comes up you simply notice it without
grasping or clinging or rejecting and
you give thanks for this experience for
this fall for this emotion this person
in your life is event in your life
and as your heart fills with gratitude
for this thought this event this person
this situation this emotion he begins to
dissolve
and it begins to move further and
further away from you
moving back into the blackness of space
no longer resonant with you no longer
associated with you as you thank it and
watch it become smaller and smaller in
the distance disappearing dissolving
thoughts of I can't I'm not good enough
I'm sick I'm not worried I'm gonna
lovable I'm guilty I'm wrong I'm bad
and as you thank each and every one of
these thoughts the emotions associated
with these thoughts the people the
places the times associated with these
thoughts as you think and as your heart
opens they move further and further away
becoming smaller and smaller dissolving
into the blackness of space
I need turn every time that one of these
thoughts beliefs fears people places
situations memories each time one comes
out you think it you open your heart and
you watch it completely dissolve release
back into the blackness of space
no longer identified with you no longer
tied to you
no longer part of your experience
because you choose to let it go
letting go of the fears of limitations
letting go of the pain the hurt the
suffering back into the blackness of
space
and as you continue your journey into
this open infinite space
you notice a beautiful light pure white
light very shiny very bright and you
feel pulled to it attracted to it
and as you connect to it you recognize
it as your intention
the most meaningful thing that you want
to achieve in your life right now
whether that be having a mystical
experience achieving abundance success
in your life in your career harmonious
relationships healing creativity
whatever it is that you're wanting to
achieve to manifest in your life right
now you recognize it
in the blackness of space as this
shining light that pulls you to it
and as you recognize it you merge with
it you become one with it
and you immediately feel how good it
feels to be soaking in this light one
with your intention feelings of
gratitude Oh
feelings of being blessed joy a love for
life feeling so much love in your heart
as you float in that space as you soak
in this light the light of your some of
your intention one with it
and in this light any thought of I can't
I'll start tomorrow I'm not good enough
I've been bad I've been wrong all of
those thoughts immediately dissolve in
the white light in the pure light of
your consciousness of your soul
in the white light of pure consciousness
and in this light you continue to expand
to open to feel one with your intention
feeling so light and so free unlimited
filled with this love for life joyful
appreciate filled with gratitude and all
filled with so much creative energy so
much love and as you bathe in this light
anything from the past there is not you
that keeps pulling you back into who you
are not who you've never been completely
dissipates dissolves you're one with the
light one with the light of your soul
with the light of pure consciousness
and as you keep expanding in this light
the things from the past are moving
further and further away from you into
the darkness of space into the darkness
of possibilities that you're no longer
identified with all of these experiences
that you've learned from all of the
wisdom that you've gained through those
experiences those relationships those
beliefs those fears are moving far far
far away from you
and you continue to expand open
with your heart completely open this
beautiful light of pure consciousness
filled with the light filled with the
love of the divine
one with it
as the field around you continues to
expand as the light within you continues
to shine brightly brighter and brighter
anything from the darkness that comes
from your past any fear any belief any
past relationship
anything that is no longer serving you
immediately dissolves and clears in the
light and only the pure light of
consciousness remains the light of
source the light of your soul
and as you continue to connect the
feelings of being unlimited free feeling
all feeling loved a love for life a love
for yourself
I love for all things feeling gratitude
feeling blessed
you continue to expand to open and to
attract to you all the wonderful things
the beautiful things that match your
energy bringing into your life abundance
vibrant health harmonious and loving
relationships success in your life
however you define it a sense of self
love self-acceptance and self
forgiveness in every moment a feeling of
deep inner peace well-being groundedness
balance
and you integrate all of these feelings
deep deep into your heart
and let your whole body feel this very
deeply integrated changing vibration the
energy state of your whole body of your
whole being change by this experience
realising your oneness with everything
that is with pure consciousness
and your capacity to tune into any
potential in the field that is in your
highest and best good from moment to
moment
feeling light free open

becoming aware of the room that you're
in becoming aware of how different you
feel now compared to how you felt when
you started this meditation your body is
different your mind is different

[Music]
bringing back with you the light of your
soul
to shine upon your life in every moment
to dissolve any farts to dissolve
anything from the past that is not
serving you
[Music]
to find yourself completely present in
the moment one with pure consciousness
with all potentials
[Music]
in the present moment
and when you're ready filled with this
light filled with this love in a state
of deep calm relaxation gratitude

eyes
