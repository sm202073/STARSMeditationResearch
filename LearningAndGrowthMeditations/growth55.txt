how
you're taking the cool air

how
it is hitting
the upper parts of your nostrils

inhalation where the cold air is mixing
with the blood in your head
the warmth
in your head has reduced

replaced with the blue hue
like a mild fire
burning

you will see
that the blood flow is being restored
to each and every part of your brain
and to all the muscles
in the center of your head

that the blood is now
flowing into the various layers of your
scalp
into your hair follicles
and restoring
your hair follicles
this cool blood
is removing any blockages
in these various layers of the skin in
your scalp
and restoring all your hair follicles
as you notice this
keep up the breathing process
with age and every breath
this blood flow into the various layers
of your skin on the scalp
is getting deeper and deeper
it is also further
reducing the excess of heat in your head
and removing the ushna in your head

and keeping it
balanced
it is restoring the balance in your
brain
and letting you perform
optimally
