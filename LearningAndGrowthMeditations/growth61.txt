welcome to this guided meditation
make yourself comfortable sitting
or lying down with your eyes closed
and your hands apart
to create a meditative mindset to work
on your goals
is easy by simply bringing your
attention
inside and slowing
a bit down you create a sense of
relaxation and space
inside
and you can use this inner space
to meditate on those goals
that you choose to work on today
[Music]
so now slowly take a deeper breath
in through your nose hold it for a few
seconds if you'd like to
and exhale very slowly through the mouth
and relax
let go
[Music]
relax
[Music]
very good
now as you pay attention inside
breathing softly and comfortably
[Music]
you can follow my guidance
smile inside and
enjoy the rest of your meditation
[Music]
and as you become centered by noticing
the continuous
steady flow of your breathing
you can recall for a moment the most
important benefits for you of doing your
exercise
that you're about to start
with the big picture in mind as well
[Music]
that's right
[Music]
now as you enjoy this state of
inner awareness
you can gently bring your attention to
those
muscles that you're going to use mainly
[Music]
notice how you can feel the aliveness
in those muscles
[Music]
you can take a deeper breath in slowly
slightly tensing the muscles of your
arms or legs
if you'd like to to get in tune even
more
with the life and energy in your body
and when you exhale just relax those
[Music]
muscles
[Music]
[Music]
so
that's right
[Music]
and as you are becoming more grounded in
your body
you may feel more eager to experience
the various pleasures of using your body
strengthening your muscles
exploring the potentials of this amazing
machine
that the human body is
and as you've become more in tune with
your body like this
you're going to be more focused
and centered you become
more mindful of the joys
and benefits of nurturing and
strengthening your body
[Music]
you can remember what socrates said
no man has the right to be an amateur
in the matter of physical training it is
a shame
for a man to grow old without seeing the
beauty
and strength of which his body is
[Music]
capable
[Music]
so take this mindset of focus
commitment and eagerness with you
go train your body to experience the
beauty
and strength it's capable of
enjoy your exercise
[Music]
you can have a pleasant feeling of
contentment
about all the things you've experienced
and
learned during your meditation
and now you can start gradually
refreshing yourself as we count
from zero up to three
count along with me in your mind feeling
more eager and ready to continue the day
with each number we count
zero take some deeper breaths in to
breathe in
more energy feeling fresher
one you can think about the room around
you and what you will do
next
and two you can start stretching
feeling more active
and three opening your eyes now
feeling refreshed positive and
ready to continue the day
you
