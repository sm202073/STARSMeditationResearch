welcome to a guided meditation for focus
for studying on the clutter of the mind
let's start the practice by finding a
comfortable seat
you can practice this meditation right
where you're planning to study
so it can be on a computer chair or seat
in the library or
in the bedroom or in the office
and just ensure you're sitting with your
back upright
but comfortable and resting your hands
in your lap
let's start with our eyes open
and taking in a few big deep breaths
breathing in through the nose
and out through the mouth
and now if you're doing this meditation
in public
such as in a library or school
[Music]
you can keep your eyes opened for the
practice
just maintain a soft gaze looking
downwards
otherwise you can close your eyes here
and allow your breath to return to a
comfortable pace
and let's start by reflecting
on the reality of our
distraction-filled world
there's so many things competing for our
attention
but we ultimately have in us the ability
to maintain control
over our minds and our attention
so let's start by setting an intention
for this practice
in your mind repeat the following
may i have a focused and energized
meditation session
and now let's turn our attention
to the breath
most of us don't notice that we are
breathing
all day long we simply forget that we
are breathing
we're so caught up in our days and
thoughts
it just sits there in the background
without us noticing
so let's bring our attention to the
breath
and notice the sensations around
breathing
and you don't need to change the breath
here
just allow the body to breathe on its
own and notice it
watch the rising and falling sensations
around the body with each inhale and
exhale
and when you inhale naturally
picture yourself breathing all the way
down
into your toes
feel as though the air travels all the
way
into each one of your toes on each
in-breath
and notice as you do this
as you watch the breath and maintain
this visual
thoughts and feelings may arise and
attempt to pull your attention away from
the breath
just like distractions in the world that
attempt to pull your attention away
while you study but we can notice
distractions
just like we notice the breath and when
a distraction arises
we don't need to engage with it or
follow it with more thinking
simply allow the distraction to come and
go through the mind
and then return your attention back to
the breath
and now imagine that when you inhale
you are breathing all the way into
each fingertip
imagine the feeling in your hands as the
breath
extends all the way into each
fingertip
and again if you find that the mind has
become distracted or
lost in thought if it's planning
or thinking about what you'll be doing
after the practice
don't become frustrated or attach more
thoughts to these thoughts
simply notice it as a distraction
allow the thought to dissipate and then
return your attention
to the breath
and now i want you to
bring your attention to how you are
feeling
right now notice how focused
or unfocused you are in this moment
there's no judgment needed just be with
whatever you notice
and when it's time to focus and study
all we need to do is calm the mind
and ground our attention
our goal is to keep our mind with the
task at hand
and let it enter a flow state on its own
we just need to create the internal
conditions
to allow that to happen
but this also means creating the right
conditions
in our external world
so this practice focused on our internal
worlds but
outside we need to mute our phones
close out all other tabs use tools that
allow us to block social media
and news sites create the conditions
both
internally and externally for a
successful
study session
and now let's close out the practice
by setting an intention for our studying
session
and for the rest of our day
so in your mind repeat
may i have a focused and productive
study session
may i be undistracted and concentrated
may i be committed to my studies
may i focus effortlessly
and now open your eyes
you've just completed the practice for
studying
thanks for sitting and may you have a
focused and productive day
you
