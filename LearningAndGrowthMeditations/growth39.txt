begin by lying flat on your back
palms at your side facing upwards
legs fanned out slightly
if you need to make any adjustments hit
pause to do so
otherwise lovingly close your eyes
begin by focusing your awareness on your
breath
allow yourself to become present with
the sensation of breathing
feeling your stomach expand as you
breathe in
and contract as you breathe out
wherever you are in your day
whatever it is you've been doing right
now
you are here you're in this
beautiful moment you are where you are
meant to be
and you feel that truth now
you let whatever's been simply be
as you in this moment simply are
you tune into the weight of gravity
feeling your body against the surface on
which you are resting
you allow yourself to drop down
as if you are an anchor
gravity takes over completely
as you let your muscles go slack
and you let your breath be soft
and gentle
as you feel at once both your body and
mind relaxing you begin to imagine
around you
a dome of white light
it is sparkling and magnificent
its radiance is almost warm on your skin
[Music]
as if you're basking in the sun rays all
around you
[Music]
it's a diamond white light
and you take a moment simply to bask in
its radiance
you feel its energy entering into your
cells
into every space within every cell
as if this beautiful warmth is entering
in making its way
into every atom of your being
lighting you up with this magnificent
radiance
until light begins to burst forth from
your physical body
and you feel yourself rising up
as if being lifted by the light
until you are in a space where all there
is
is pure luminescent
white light
it's as if you are suspended here in
this energy
light pouring from you radiating around
you
and it's as if you're being lifted up
first from your own heart
as if your heart is leading the way
drop your awareness into the space in
the middle of your chest
where your heart's energy center lies
tune in to how uplifted it feels right
now
you feel a sense that the tides are
changing
the winds of change are wrapping around
you
you feel as though you are being
cleansed
and cleared from any ancient debris
that's
no longer needed in your path on life
you may even see as if debris is just
falling away from you being incinerated
by the white light
and the more you feel yourself letting
go the higher you feel yourself lifting
[Music]
and with your body rising higher and
higher
so tune does your frequency
you feel yourself lifting up
rising to connect with this
incredible divine wisdom
this energy of oneness with all that is
this connection to love
you may feel a smile come across your
face as you feel connected to this
and it's as if you can hear the word
renewal
being whispered in your ears
it's time you feel and know it's time to
shake off any cobwebs
and to lift up into true purpose true
meaning
it's as if you're on this spiral path
and you feel so ready for the next
corner you're turning into
[Music]
the next curve you're taking
you don't know what lies ahead but you
know
it is of your highest most loving good
you feel the pathways
rearranging now so that as you come
around this curve in your journey
up a hand is the perfect path for you
in your highest most loving divine
timeline
[Music]
yes the winds of change are blowing
yes you are entering into a sense of
renewal and regeneration
rejuvenation enjoy
you feel hope trust and optimism growing
within you
as you know this next season of life
is full of life
full of radiance exuberance
and you can feel that growing and rising
within you
you affirm to yourself i'm ready for
this next chapter
i eagerly await it with loving
anticipation
i trust the path i'm on
and i'm excited to see what unfolds
[Music]
you continue to carry this feeling with
you as you feel your body descending
back down
feeling it reconnecting with where
you're lying right now
[Music]
feeling it connect into the surface on
which you're resting
you lovingly begin to wiggle your
fingers and toes
roll your shoulders
and really take your time as you slowly
open your eyes back to the world around
you
allow yourself to really take your time
reintegrating
and when you're ready do the journaling
