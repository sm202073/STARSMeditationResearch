The body is always breathing, and the breath is constantly moving.

Your breath is not only the best place to start; it’s a constant you can return to anytime you need a little centering.

In this practice, you will gently find the breath in the body.

There is nothing to figure out, there are no problems to solve, and there’s nothing special you need to do.

Constantly return to your direct experience of the body breathing.

You are training the mind to be with one experience without distraction.

Find a comfortable position for the body.

Sitting is often recommended, as it helps keep the body awake and energized.

You can also try lying flat on your back, or standing.

You may sit on a yoga mat, meditation cushion, or chair.

Find what feels comfortable and sustainable for a few minutes of stillness.

Gently allow the eyes to close.

If you’re more comfortable with the eyes open, try softly gazing at the floor or ceiling (depending on your position).

Allow the eyes to relax and rest on one spot.

The idea is to minimize distractions in your practice.

Bring your awareness to the abdomen.

Relaxing the muscles there, see if you can feel the natural rising and falling.

Imagine the body is breathing itself.

From the navel around to the obliques, notice the movement with each breath.
