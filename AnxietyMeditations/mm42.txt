hello welcome to today's gentle movement practice for relieving stress and anxiety
i'm sarah raymond with the mindful movement so just a quick overview of what we're going to be doing today
primarily it's going to be seated so you can be seated in a chair or on the floor
even on a couch whatever is comfortable for you and then the second half will be a little bit on the floor so if you're
comfortable coming down onto the floor with me you'll join me if not then you just participate in the front first half
of the practice so we'll start with a little bit of breathing and then
some gentle self-massage techniques to bring some awareness to different
body parts when you might be feeling anxious and need a little bit of grounding and then
some gentle stretches to open up the area that allows you to deepen your breath
and find a little bit more ease if you are experiencing stress or anxiety
so let's get right to it so come to any comfortable seated position and we'll start with a
four seven eight breath so it's an inhale through your nose for four counts a hold
for up to seven if you don't feel comfortable with seven then you can do a shorter hold and then it's a slow
exhale through your nose for eight counts and i'll count you through the first two and then we'll practice a
little bit on our own so again finding any comfortable seated posture
tall lifted spine shoulders relaxed and down maybe close your eyes if you'd like
and then exhale fully as a preparation breathe in two three
four hold two three four five
six seven breathe out two three four five
six seven eight again breathe in two three four hold
two three four five six seven breathe out
two three four five 6 7 8
now continue on your own
so
finish one more cycle on your own
and then allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm normal depth and flow
and then next we'll take three deep inhales through the nose
and this time as you exhale create an audible sigh
so do that two more times
let your body soften and relax with each
exhale
blink your eyes open if they were closed okay so next we're going to move on to
as i said some self massage techniques i'll take my glasses off here so we'll start with the facial massage and
you're just putting a gentle pressure doesn't have to be significant you can use your fingers or if you have
a tiny little ball that might work too but you're basically finding the bones
in your face and pressing on the bones and you might just press along the bones
or you can press and gently pull either outward downward upward whatever
feels like it's the most effective for you we're not going to spend a ton of time here
you can again close your eyes if you like and go against your nose
at the cheekbone above your eye
eyebrow i should say above your eyebrow your forehead
and then i like to spend a good bit of time right at around the jaw so it's pretty much in line with
where your ear is so you can find them there's a bone on
the top and a bone on the bottom and then there's a little indentation and you can press there
and open and close your jaw
and then go around the jaw
and then you would just of course do the same on the other side
and if there's any areas that feel particularly sore you might just stay there and take a few
deep breaths and like we practiced earlier when your
exhale is longer than your inhale it can have a little bit of a relaxing
effect relaxing effect for you
you'll start to find the areas that feel like you need to spend the most time there and you can always just explore
there so again find the jaw hinge of the jaw
open and close
okay and if there's anywhere that you feel like you need to spend a little bit more time you can do that otherwise we'll move on
to our neck so you can use both hands or one at a time your choice
you'll feel just behind the ears the bone start there and then start to
work your way down
and you can even go to this upper trapezius area so the top of your neck and shoulders
and then let me show you from the back you're going to take one hand on either side of your neck so
on either side of your spine i should say and then think of pulling outward and as you do gently let your
head drop back and then come back up again
so you'll go through that a few times right starting right at the base of the skull
and then working your way down
and then after you do that a few times you can um i like actually do this with the opposite
hand so the muscle right at the top of your shoulder you'll grab with your opposite hand squeeze up
draw your shoulder up towards your ear and then just release down squeeze up and release down
one more time on the side and then we can switch sides
so as you squeeze that muscle lift your shoulder up and release
and all the time continuing to breathe
fluidly good okay and then last bit of self
massage will be the area of your chest so if you can find your collarbone at the
top of your chest you're going to go just below the collarbone
and you'll just give a little bit of pressure you can push in and then pull down
gently and as you pull down you might explore turning your head in the opposite direction
so you feel a little bit of stretch through maybe the neck at least so my my left side is always a
little bit tighter especially at the neck here so i know i need that
and then you might go down a little bit below the collarbone if that feels okay for you
and we'll do the other side so finding the collarbone right below press in and feel free to
either tip your head towards the opposite shoulder or turn your head towards the opposite shoulder
maybe again go down a little bit below the collarbone
okay and that will be all of our self massage today so next we'll start to do some very
gentle stretches so again you can remain in any comfortable seated position arms by your sides
and then we'll stretch through our neck here so you can begin by tipping your right ear towards your
right shoulder i'll mirror you here and as you're tipping your head to your
right think about drawing your left shoulder down away from your ear
and then you'll draw your chin towards your right
collarbone and then you can either stay here with your chin towards your collarbone or go
back to chin forward whatever feels comfortable and then take your left arm out just um
above the height of your hip i would say turn your palm forward and then you're moving from your wrist
so you'll draw your fingers backwards and forwards a few times
be gentle here there's no need to be aggressive with these stretches
and then just allow your arm to relax down draw your chin toward your chest slowly
and then your head comes back up and we'll do the same on the other side so nice and gentle tip your left ear
towards your left shoulder encouraging your right shoulder to stay down
and then turn your chin you can see i'm moving very slowly to make sure i don't go too far
too fast chin towards the left collarbone
and then as we start to add the movement from the arm you can again either keep your chin down or tip it forward but you're still
bringing your ear towards your shoulder and then we lift uh let's see this is your right arm out
to the side just a little higher than your hip and then palm facing forward as you move from the
wrist fingers go back and fingers forward and you might start to notice if you're
tensing up through the neck this might be too high so bring your arm down or make the movement from your wrist a
little smaller
and then relax your hand down slowly draw your chin toward your chest
and just letting your head hang here for a moment take a breath in and out
and then slowly bringing your head back up all right and then from here a couple
spine stretches so we'll lift your left arm drawing your shoulder down and think about
lifting up tall and at the same time grounding down and then gently side bending over to
your right and now we'll start to add some movement but i want you to try to focus on
keeping your left sit bone heavy on the ground so as you turn your shoulders forward
towards the floor you're not lifting that right uh the right side of your butt up
and then come back to center and turn your chest towards the ceiling
and center now we'll keep doing that movement you're going to bring your eyes to focus on your top hand and then we'll
follow the hand so you're looking forward as your shoulders rotate forward
looking back towards the ceiling and then behind you one more time rotating forward looking
forward rotating back
and come through center and back up again all right maybe roll your shoulders
around a few times and we'll do the other side so lift your right arm again lift tall
first and root down through the pelvis and then we side bend over so
as i said my left side is always a little tighter so i have to remind myself to draw that shoulder down easy in the neck and then begin to
rotate shoulders forward and back
and now adding the eyes so looking up at your top hand rotating forward just keep that top hand
as your focal point one more time forward
and back and center and up again
okay so um this next part if you are comfortable lying down on your back i
would recommend doing that if you prefer to be seated you can definitely do this seated
so i'm going to take it down onto the floor and
once you lay down you're going to interlace your hands and place your hands right at the base
of the head now again you could do the same exact thing as seated if you prefer now if you have any
shoulder issues uh if just one shoulder is not comfortable in this position you can
just do this with one hand or if neither of your shoulders are comfortable uh overhead you can use a pillow under
your head is fine so we're finding this sense of almost traction so my hands are at the base of
the skull where there's two little bony points and i'm gently lengthening those two bony points away
from my shoulder so that my neck is nice and long and then i'll relax my arms by my
side so my head's heavy neck is relaxed and then
i'm actually gonna do this without my glasses with your eyes only look as
far to your right as you can and you'll just allow your eyes to stay
in that position so eyes are looking as far to the right as you can without moving your head
and then come back to your breath
and we'll stay here for a few breaths if you feel a sense of release or
relaxation response like a sigh or a yawn you can bring your eyes back to center
if you don't quite get there then you'll just stay for a few more breaths
and then bring your eyes back to center if they're not already and just blink
your eyes a couple times you may have to repossession reposition
your head and neck and then we'll do the same thing to the left so you're keeping your
head still and moving only your eyes looking as far to the left as possible
and then once you do that you'll keep your eyes left
back to your breath and then just allow your body to relax so maybe scanning
through physical sensations of your body to see if there's anywhere you could
soften you know i tend to grip through my hips a little bit so it's helpful to relax there
[Music] or maybe you could find a little more ease in your shoulders
take one more breath looking left
come back to center again blink your eyes
and then you can close your eyes and take your hands out from behind your head relax them by your
sides and then if you are uh laying on your back just bring your knees in toward
your chest you're still seated you might fold forward over your legs
just in essence giving yourself a gentle hug and take a few breaths there
checking in to see how you're feeling
okay and then releasing your feet back down or coming back to seated and then we're
going to move on to laying on our belly
so you'll roll over if you're on the floor come down onto the floor if you were seated and then you're going to be
propped up on your forearms so elbows under shoulders if you can
if this feels like it's too much on your lower back then you can take
your elbows wider and if that still feels like too much you might go still a little wider or other
option would be to be all the way down okay so we do want to be working to open the
chest as much as possible so again you can take nice deep breaths
okay so if you're on your forearms you're pressing down into the forearm to lift the crown of your head as tall
towards the ceiling as you can and then you might allow your butt
muscles and your legs to relax
and then start to breathe into your belly expanding side to side front to back
and as you're breathing out do your best to avoid sinking down into the shoulders
okay so you can stay here or we're going to add a side bend so leading with your eyes look
left side bend left so that means your left shoulder will go towards your left
hip and you're looking with your eyes to see how far behind you can see maybe you could see one foot maybe you
can see both and then come back to center and then to the other side
so eyes first then the shoulders and then the waist
and center now coordinating that with your breath so you can really breathe in either either pattern but i like to inhale as i
side bend and exhale back to center keep thinking
about the crown of the head lifting away from the floor
and then last little addition here if you're comfortable with it is to add a bend of the opposite knee so as
you side bend the left you're bending your right knee and center
and as you side bend right you're bending your left knee
so remember eyes are leading the way we'll do one more in each direction
and then come down stack one hand over the other and you can rest either your cheek or your forehead on your hand
and then take a nice deep breath into your belly
and let it out we'll do one more belly breath here i like to do the belly
breath on the floor like this because you can feel your belly expand against the floor
okay and if you're comfortable on your knees in a child's pose position
you can go there so you can either have your knees apart and your big toes together with your
knees together and your big toes together hips back and then chest comes down now
if your knees and or hips are not happy here just roll onto your back and hug your knees into your chest
a few breaths again soften and relax the body
okay and then we're going to add a side bend here so taking your hands over to your left
ribs over to your left and then settling into that child's pose position again
you might encourage your right hip to draw back your right fingers to crawl forward
and then now as you breathe send your breath into the right side of your body from the armpit down
to the ribs down to the waist
and then take your time coming over to the other side
so again drawing now left hip back left fingers forward
using your breath into the left side of your body to create expansion to increase mobility of
the ribs and the muscles that assist in breathing
and then come back to center and back up again
okay so we are going to do one more stretch to continue to open up the rib cage area
again the muscles in between the ribs help to
breathe or allow for a deeper breath so you come on to your side
with your knees bent so they're going to line up with your hips and then your bottom arm can go out in
front and if your neck is okay with it your head can come down if you feel like you need a little bit of a support just
grab a pillow or a blanket or a towel and roll it up and then we'll start to lift the top
hand towards the ceiling so right up over your shoulder again use your eyes to
facilitate this so you're looking at your hand just above your shoulders and then start to bring
your top shoulder towards the floor and that will allow your arm to go back keep following your hand with your eyes
as far as you can and then eventually maybe your arm reaches the ground
and if it doesn't that's okay but if it feels like it's strain on the elbow you can bend your
elbow and just rest your hand on your shoulder so more importantly is that we're twisting
through the rib cage here and the chest stretch is sort of a bonus
there if you do feel comfortable with your hand on the floor all right once we have arrived in our
twist you're welcome to close your eyes and begin to breathe into the area
that feels like it's stretching the most for you so perhaps it's the rib cage or maybe
it's your hip or your inner thighs whatever you're feeling
is fine just send your breath there
and encourage relaxation to come to you
and then take your time as you start to unwind yourself
back and then we are going to turn over and do the other side
so you make your way onto your second side again knees are bent out in line with your hips bottom
arm out in front head comes down and then you'll lift your top arm up
towards the ceiling find the hand as your focal point and then your
shoulder is the first to move so as if you're trying to get that top shoulder to touch the floor behind you
which first folks it won't quite get there and that's okay
so once you twist as far as you can you can always bend the back elbow and put your hand on your
chest if that feels more supportive or you can let your hand rest on the floor
closing your eyes if you wish and taking a few deep breaths scanning through your body
noticing where you feel any restriction or gripping
and sending your breath there
okay take your time as you untwist
and then you can use your top hand to press you up to seated
and then as you come to seed it again let's uh do a quick check-in so you'll
close your eyes let your arms relax by your sides
first notice your natural breath after spending some time in self-care
you might notice your emotional state after this short practice to help reset
your nervous system and decrease stress and anxiety
you might check in with your physical state notice the muscles around your eyes
your jaw your neck
see if there's a little bit more softening available softening the outer
layer
connect with this calm peaceful feeling
know that is always within you within reach
when you're ready gently blinking your eyes open
so any of that can be separated out and used on its own so the four seven
eight breath pattern the self massage techniques or any of the stretches to be
used to help calm you down bring you you know back into your body if you're feeling
uh moments of stress or anxiety and additionally i'll share with you a playlist of all of
our meditation practices for anxiety so that you can
pull one up whenever you need it i hope you have a peaceful and calm day remember come
back to this practice anytime you need it thanks for joining me
