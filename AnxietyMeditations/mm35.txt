i'm sarah raymond thank you for choosing
me
as your guide today
i invite you to make yourself
comfortable
[Music]
choose a position either seated
or lying down with
your spine straight
settle into your practice by
closing your eyes to
heighten your awareness of this present
moment
through the senses other than sight
[Music]
as you begin to relax
breathe in through your nose
[Music]
full and deep in location
and breathe out completely
through your mouth making a sigh
sound
do this again fill up
expand with your inhale
and let go relax
with your exhale
sending your breath deep
into your belly
rather than shallow into your chest
will encourage your neck and shoulders
to be at ease
continue to breathe like this
for a few more cycles on your own
and as you do
perhaps feel your body soften
your muscles loosen
and your mind
[Music]
calm
simply notice the sensations of your
breath
and by paying attention
the breath leads your mind's attention
and relaxes you further
now become aware of where your body
meets the support beneath you
[Music]
sense the weight of your body heavy
on the support
notice all the points of contact
feel the pressure there
perhaps you notice a similar heaviness
in other areas of your body
[Music]
sense the constant pull of gravity
anchoring you into the surface beneath
you
[Music]
feel yourself melting into your
surroundings
becoming one with them
[Music]
in this relaxed state your
perceived boundaries are falling away
the air merging what is inside of you
with what is outside of you
[Music]
as you continue to relax
in your mind i will guide you
on a journey of release
releasing the heavy weight that is
holding you down
so that you can experience a lightness
and a sense of freedom
imagine that you are wearing the stress
and tension from your day as a jacket
it is very thick and heavy
and it weighs you down
[Music]
when you wear this jacket you are
tethered
to the ground and you spend
twice the energy to take
just one step
you are ready now to shed the weight of
this jacket
as you can sense it is keeping you stuck
in your mind imagine yourself
taking off your jacket
[Music]
although it is heavy you have the inner
strength
to unzip it and take
this jacket off
as you feel this substantial weight
being released
you are suddenly so light
that you feel as if you could float
into the air
surrender into this lightness
and feel the freedom
observe and appreciate this lightness
for a moment
[Music]
connect with this light and free feeling
of
ease throughout your entire
body
[Music]
you have shed a layer
to bring you closer to the core
of your inner peace
sense that you have let go
you have surrendered into the
weightlessness
of ease
take a deep breath in
and let it out with a sigh
[Music]
do this again and with your eyes
still closed slowly
invite your field of awareness to
broaden
outward once more
[Music]
notice the sounds around you
become aware of the surface below you
[Music]
and as you are beginning to open your
field of awareness
and sense your surroundings
see if you can do so while you continue
to stay connected with your inner
experience
and the lightness you have created
when you are ready gradually let a
little light in through your eyes
and take in your surroundings
continue to practice shedding the
heaviness
throughout your day
to experience a sense of peace
and freedom
thank you for practicing with me today
