his structured breath will promote a
deep sense of relaxation
this pattern can be used almost any time
of the day
as long as you are in a safe place not
active or
operating any machinery
i will guide you as we begin then you
will practice on your own
enjoying some peaceful background music
there will be an inhale through your
nose for the count of four
a hold for the count of seven
and an exhale for the count of eight
we will be practicing in sets of four
and you will have time to
normalize your breath between sets
and also to notice how you feel and what
arises for you
as we begin i invite you to make
yourself
comfortable
choose to sit or lie down with your
spine straight
your arms and legs relaxed
[Music]
close your eyes and bring your attention
inward as you turn off your sense of
sight
notice how you feel now so
you can compare after the practice
take a few breaths to collect yourself
and begin to shift into a peaceful state
and now as i begin to guide you on the
4 7 8 breath pattern
you can exhale fully to prepare
and now breathe in two three

seven exhale two three

and now relax and let your breath
slowly normalize
and let your body drift a little further
into ease
as you rest easy notice any shifts
in the way your body feels
and now we will practice another round
of four breaths

as your breath softens into its natural
pace
allow yourself to go even further into
relaxation
[Music]

time to relax your mind
to relax your breath
and now for this next set of breaths

continue to
deepen the relaxation response

and now relax your breath and let it
gradually
return to its calm natural pace
[Music]
and now practice one more round of four
breaths on your own
using this four seven eight pattern
at your own pace
[Music]
[Music]
when you have completed the fourth
breath
of this final round
relax for a moment longer
enjoying the tranquil state you have
moved into
take your time and slowly
allow your breath to wind down
as it needs
welcome a sense of peace to wash over
you
as you take in this beautiful sensation
notice the change in your state of body
and mind as you have shifted
into ease
invite your awareness to broaden
outside of your breath and body once
more
become aware of this space around you
the air the room
the surface beneath you
when you feel ready take a deep breath
in
and open your eyes
continue practicing this regularly for
profound improvements in how you are
feeling
thank you for practicing with me today
i hope you have a peaceful and joyful
day
