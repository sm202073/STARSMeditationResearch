as you begin to concentrate on your body
with love and compassion for each part of yourself

and become aware of your own physical presence
allow the weight of your body to become heavy
into the surface below you [Music]

completely into stillness

on a journey of sensation through your body
[Music] as i say each body part
[Music] if it feels right to you
as you breathe in say in your mind i am aware of this body part
as you breathe out say in your mind
i love and accept this body part
you may also smile as you send love to this part of your
body
as your concentrating on your body with love and compassion
you can drop into deeper awareness
[Music] become aware of the top of your head
[Music] breathe in

lower legs

and feet
let your flowing concentration shift to your natural breath for now
and notice how you are feeling
allow your attention to tune into any aspect
of your breath that draws your focus
first
watch your breath without changing it
simply experience your breath [Music]
sense it feel it follow it
attach no judgment to it simply
experience it fully
life always takes place in this present moment
[Music] your life is a series
of present moment experiences one breath at a time
[Music]
experience all there is to know about your breath
[Music]
[Music] perhaps you can notice something about
your breath you may not have noticed before
[Music] maybe you notice the cool air
as it passes through your nostrils on your inhale
or the warm quality of the air as it is being released
know that each exhale is a time
to let go even further into relaxation
notice your breathing as it comes and goes
[Music] noticing your breath
you can relax further if you wish
you may notice with the attention on your breath
it has naturally slowed down
it has relaxed you
[Music] like your breath slowing down
your mind too can slow down with every breath
you may sense more space between your breaths
as well as more space between your thoughts
continue to relax your body completely
perhaps you would like to go further still into
emotional relaxation
you can imagine that each natural breath you take
sweeps away any remaining tension
or emotional strain from your body
and your mind
[Music] to fully engage with life
it is important to acknowledge and accept your emotions
letting go of labels of right or wrong
and good or bad
emotions are simply energy and when you allow yourself to
experience these emotions as they arise
the energy will move through you and the emotions do not need to rule you
[Music] become aware of an emotion
that is present within you now
sense the feeling of this emotion
with acceptance
when you accept an emotion as it is in the present
you can allow the energy to move through you [Music]
acknowledge this emotion lean into this feeling
and do your best to accept this emotion
stay with the feeling of the emotion and let go of the story
about the emotion
you may begin to notice a sense of softening
and ease around this emotion
when you connect with and sit with this energy it doesn't have to rule you
as it moves through you this energy
allows you to become more aware of the full experience of life
as you continue this relaxed inward awareness
become aware of any thoughts arising
witness them without following them
see them surface flow by and disappear
you may even think of thoughts as slippery objects
that you couldn't hold on to even if you wanted to
when you grasp or try to hold on to the thoughts
they slip right out of your grip
if it feels right to you as you notice the thinking
as you breathe in say in your mind i am aware of thoughts arising
as you breathe out say in your mind
i am aware of thoughts passing
or more simply thoughts arising
thoughts passing
allow this process to relax your mind and body
[Music] even deeper
you may even notice your thoughts coming with more space between them
as you practice allowing them to rise
and fall
let go of judgments of thoughts knowing they are not good or bad
be the witness of the thoughts in the present
allow the thoughts to pass by like clouds in the sky
they have their chance to be seen and honored
and then they flowed away just as quickly
allow ease to settle in to your mind and body
allow yourself to go further still into
relaxation as you shift your focus to the area of your heart
begin to cultivate a positive quality
of gratitude to change your state
from within
[Music]
enjoy the expansive open space at your heart
as you recall something or someone
that naturally brings the feeling of gratitude into your heart
hold on to this feeling of gratitude in your heart
let gratitude arise and fill your body and mind
[Music] allow yourself to be grateful
and appreciate that life is a precious gift
sense this gratitude not only in your heart but
throughout your entire body
connect with this gratitude and know that it is within you
be open to seeing the positive in situations
be open to experiencing joy and gratitude
and now that your heart is open supported
and full of gratitude you are in the perfect state to listen
adopt and absorb the following statements and beliefs
as you continue to build the loving expansive energy in your heart
you are able to manifest all that you desire
abundance love and vibrant health are coming to you in infinite amounts
and you are ready to accept
as your physical body continues to relax
your thinking mind can rest
in a moment i will guide your subconscious with some positive
affirmative statements to support restoring
and rejuvenating your energy [Music]
my voice becomes your voice as you hear these statements
and it goes with you long after this recording is over
for continued support
you don't have to do anything and it is normal for your listening to
fade your subconscious will listen
as your body relaxes
as i lay here i know i am safe
my body and mind know what i need to restore my energy and health
my safety is at the foundation of well-being
and i know that i am safe
i am grateful for my replenished energy
[Laughter]
my body is continuously healing in every moment of every day
my mind is healing as i rest
my mind is getting rejuvenating rest so i can be at my best
i allow the stress of the day to let go
and drift from my body
i allow the stress in my mind to release
and let go
i feel my body and mind rejuvenating
as i rest
let all of this go release your scanning awareness and
thoughts simply be
resting in pure awareness pure spaciousness

[Music]
now remember your intention
repeat your intention in your mind several times
[Music]
feel it in your heart planting the seed to grow
as you either drift into a healing sleep for the night
or if you choose as you transition out of yoga nidra
[Music] if you are listening to this recording with the intention
to move into a sleeping state
my voice will simply fade into the background
and you will be ready to sleep
if you are transitioning out of yoganidra
and moving on with your day your subconscious will listen
to my voice as you have rested fully
now if you are ready to journey back to full awareness
invite your attention to move outward again

awaken gradually with each passing breath
become aware of your heart and breathe into this space
let your heart's energy move outward and awaken you
as you gradually become more and more aware

if you are moving into sleep
if you are ready to come out of yoga nidra
allow the sense of gratitude to fill you completely
as you breathe in and breathe out

yourself thank you for practicing with me
