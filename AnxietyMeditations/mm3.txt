hello and welcome thank you for taking
the time to listen to this meditation to
help you find inner peace it will help
you to calm the feelings of being
overwhelmed that may cause you to get
anxious or stuck in life we are a
culture of information overload and live
in a busy over scheduled world where we
often think we need to do it all and do
it perfectly this mindset of being
attached to the perfect outcomes can be
at the root of overwhelm or anxiety and
can cause you to get stuck in your
thoughts or actions today we will begin
the process of self inquiry to get
curious about what we are really feeling
be okay with life as it is and then
nurture and open our hearts with
kindness this process will help you to
find peace from within
let's begin make yourself comfortable
with your arms and legs uncrossed make
sure to turn off all possible
distractions and set this time aside for
you
in a moment I will guide you through a
body scan to begin the process of
relaxation so you can release tension
and negativity by letting go completely
you can turn your attention inward
and now allow your eyes to close gently
and bring your focus to your breath
[Music]
without changing your breath simply
notice how it flows in through your nose
feel the cool air as it passes into your
nostrils and fills you up
encourage each natural out-breath to
release any tension that you may be
feeling continue to observe your breath
and allow it to deepen naturally and
slow down today you will practice
connecting to what is true for you in
your heart you will cultivate loving
energy for yourself to nurture what is
true for you and to find peace give
yourself permission to be fully
supported by the earth to connect to the
collective energy of the universe and to
be open to possibilities of what comes
with the state of comfort and relaxation
and now slowly begin to scan your body
as I say each part of your body
encouraged a release a complete
relaxation to find ease in your body
allow the surface below you to support
you fully
[Music]
begin this body scan at your feet and
simply relax move your attention up from
your feet and begin to release your
lower legs and knees
feel how each part of your body becomes
heavy and connected to the energy around
you as you allow it to let go and now
find a sense of ease and your thighs and
hips as you let go completely
moving up take a deep breath to help
release any tightness in your lower back
continue this process of increasing your
comfort and connection to the collective
energy of the universe around you and
welcome a feeling of softening into your
abdomen let your chest and arms rest
heavy on the surface below you
feel as your neck and throat release any
physical and emotional tension that you
may be holding on to
[Music]
allow your jaw to unclench and feel as
the small muscles of your cheeks
I then forehead soften and smooth
and as the small muscles in your face
and jaw let go the rest of your body
follows and softens as well
now your whole body is heavy on the
earth
[Music]
and allowing your breath to return to
its natural rhythm and flow you find
that you are fully relaxed you know you
are safe and supported and you are open
to guiding yourself into a calm state of
mind
now that you are fully relaxed you can
begin this inquiry process
by checking in with what is true for you
what you are actually feeling without
judgment and without trying to change
anything
[Music]
make space for the truth to surface and
whatever form it comes simply allow it
to surface
[Music]
consider the situation or feeling that
has you overwhelmed or stuck
recognize what you are feeling and
accepted in the present moment
know that the state of overwhelm is
simply an obstacle on your path
and it is part of your journey
[Music]
because this may be a negative or
challenging emotion let down your guard
and your armor to this emotion
make space for awareness and acceptance
without judgement
we often have the unconscious impulse to
push away suppress or ignore difficult
emotions which simply brings about more
suffering
some might busy themselves to prove
their worth or neglect what is really
going on some may have a fear of failure
and the overwhelm may paralyze them
some may feel anxious or restless based
on all that there is to do whatever you
are feeling is okay these are simply
patterns that have developed they are
not you
recognize the self-talk going on in your
mind
recognize the potential that you may
have unmet or unrecognized expectations
from yourself or others that may be
playing a role in the judgments of
yourself
[Music]
or possibly you're experiencing negative
self-talk
[Music]
begin to move out of the thinking
patterns and bring your attention to
your felt experience
no need to attach words or labels to
your feelings simply explore what those
feelings are
[Music]
pause and allow these feelings
sometimes we may be judgmental when a
negative feeling surfaces
acknowledged the feeling and allow it to
be what it is without judgment
[Music]
or sometimes we may push the feeling
down and focus on something else
[Music]
in this situation being present is the
way stay in the moment stay with the
feeling and be okay with it
continue to make space in your heart for
these feelings to come up and simply be
[Music]
we may want to resist the discomfort of
a negative feeling and remove ourselves
from the present moment do your best to
stay present and mindful in a time when
difficult emotions come up
practicing a moment of pause after
recognizing a feeling or behavior gives
you the opportunity to make another
choice a different choice than you are
used to making
creating space during this moment of
pause allows you to stop the negative
habit or behavior before it continues it
allows you to respond skillfully rather
than reacting by simply allowing the
difficult emotion to be what it is you
are able to bring your awareness to the
present moment experience and you may
notice almost immediately a sense of
softening and ease around the emotion
simply by allowing it to be with honesty
and acceptance comes the ability to move
forward and to grow once you have
recognized the emotion and allowed it to
be what it is get curious about what you
are feeling and what is behind the
feeling explore your own truth breathe
deeply to allow space for your truth to
surface
[Music]
now is the time for some deep self
inquiry start to ask yourself some
questions about what you are
experiencing what is underneath the
feelings you are experiencing
is there a physical component to how you
are feeling
the answers may not come immediately and
that is okay
continue to allow the emotions to
surface in these next few moments of
quiet make space for the truth and
acceptance of what is the answers will
come in time
[Music]
[Music]
begin to let go of judgments let go of
self-limiting beliefs
let go of expectations
let go of fear
let go of any negativity you may be
holding on to this negativity doesn't
have to be named specifically just let
it go let the energy of negativity go
let go of any past negativities and
replace them with positive thoughts and
gratitude take a moment to release all
that is holding you back all that you
have pushed down any anger and
resentment any fears and any negativity
[Music]
as you bring the feelings and emotions
to the surface do so with a sense of
unconditional love for yourself see what
is really going on for you and proceed
with care and compassion continue to
come back to the felt experience and
move out of the thinking patterns and
then take some time to nurture yourself
place your hand on your heart if you
like and offer love and kindness to
yourself
open your heart and let it in offer
positive energy to the area of your
heart
[Music]
ask yourself what it is you need in this
moment to care for yourself
to nurture and support you ask this of
yourself often and listen really listen
to what it is that you need to calm the
sense of overwhelm to get unstuck to
find peace within
and now bring your attention back to
your physical body and deepen your
breath once more
you are now beginning your journey back
to the present moment and as you do you
will continue to nurture yourself with
care and compassion you will find inner
peace begin to reactivate each part of
your body from its relaxed State feel
the rush of energy back into your body
like a warm wave coming over you
awakening your body slowly and when you
are ready open your eyes you are fully
back in this present moment feeling
awake and energized
