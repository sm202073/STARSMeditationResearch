slowly up to your ears hold and then release acknowledge that your body is
now starting to feel more relaxed keep using your breath to relinquish any
tension and feel your body start to relax more and more

there is space between your shoulders and your ears elongating your neck
slightly you should feel the back of the chair or the mattress supporting your
body just enjoy this sensation of breath

continue breathing normally imagine that you're walking up a stone staircase that
spirals around the steps are made from white marble you trail your fingers
along the stone walk to your left as you climb [Music] the stone is smooth and cold to your
touch continue to climb slowly
there are many steps spiralling up ahead of you we're not afraid of the height it
feels wonderful to be leaving all of your problems below
as you walk cast a glance down at the small room below see many boxes large
and small all of them filled to overflowing with your problems your
anxieties and all of your regrets
feel a sense of relief as you climb higher moving away from all the chaos
the clutter and anxieties below with
each step you move towards peace and inner contentment you are now
approaching the top step and an inky blackness greets you
as you emerge onto a circular Ward platform you note that the sky forms the
roof and there are millions of stars twinkling in the black expanse there is
a sudden rush of freedom feel the sense of wonder and horror as
you look towards the Hamill's
[Music]
in the middle of the pure-white curved platform there is a circular flat seat
sloping back into a contoured chair made out of the same marble as its
surroundings sit and feel the coolness of the marble
beneath you it is a perfect seat for reflection and you lean back feeling the
stone supporting your back in the most perfect places it's as if it was carved
with you in mind imagine that you are now looking up at
the night sky there are no clouds to mask the Stars and they provide you with
a vastness that is appealing a way to escape the tensions of everyday life
in real life you may feel tense frustrated and even trapped by life's
confinements but as you look up now into the depths of this extraordinary sky
dotted with stars millions of stars light-years away you feel a sense of
desire to float up high and to become one with the universe to feel weightless
to gain a new and inspiring sense of perspective feel yourself begin to float
gently out of the marble seat you move
up even higher twisting your position around so that you can look around as
you float higher you float up above the marble walls and now
you can see the view of the city around you lights the twinkle far beneath the
expanse of sky the view is magnificent you can see for miles the landscape lit
by twinkling lights heralding the existence of those who live and share
this reality with you a cityscape that comes to life with the sprinkling of
artificial lights that mirror the heavens above
you move effortlessly relishing in this feeling of freedom here you are cast
afloat from the problems of daily life it is like flying but with no effort
required a single thought enables you to
change direction at will and you travel on you look down moonlight is reflected
in the rippling waters of the estuary gentle waves lap at the shore and as you
float out further high above the darkened waters boats Bob along the
harbour walls and the feeling here is of complete peace and tranquility you feel
invisible there is no blame here no regrets just or at being able to see
life from a whole new perspective traveling over the estuary you head
along the coastline scaling large cliffs flying high above them
thin wispy clouds almost transparent from below are blown in from the sea
hugging the cliffs as you move higher
the clouds wrap themselves around you like gossamer threads the clouds wispy
fragile and translucent follow in your trail as you saw ever higher rising
vertically now higher and higher looking up towards the moon silvery gray the
moon is for you marvel at its beauty and power knowing how it controls the ebb
and wane of the tides he is suddenly life seems less
complicated there is a sense of pureness of mystery
and yet clarity life is good life is wonderful and you share a sense
of connection with the universe
breathing deeply and then release the breath letting go of any tension within
your body instead focus on the softness of every muscle feel yourself loose
relaxed and free from burden far below
you low flying birds hug the surface of the water disturbed they seem tiny and
fast moving the water ripples gently sparkling stars and the light from the
moon Herald your way you see the world
from an enlightened viewpoint and it is one of wonder here high above the
fragmented clouds you feel a part of the world's mystery connected on every level
and free from your problems
you can sense a change around you gradually the air becomes warmer and
misted as cloud formations begin to forge together the sky changes color
dark muted through to light and for a
while the Sun and Moon share a place in the heavens he dropped down now through
the fluffy clouds thicker now and float down towards the Earth's surface you
feel exalted as the see now mirrors the changing skies sparkling sunlight
glinting across the surface and shimmers of blue you drift down
moving on away from the water's edges still high above the city's architecture
tall concrete pillars and homes reaching up towards the sky and small private
residences alone surrounded by small patches of green like a complex jigsaw
of life stone and irregular shapes all fitting together in an almost seamless ease
marvel at how the man-made structures can look beautiful too here you can see
that life is about living and not holding on to problems there is no place
in your life anymore for anxieties that make you feel ill tension headaches
regrets that nor away that cue or the decisions that you just can't make here
in this weightless existence you realize that you can be free from all of the
negative aspects of life no longer shackled by an existence that holds you
back this acknowledgement is meaningful it has the power to change your life
as you breathing deeply conjure up the image of those problems and all of the
boxes that you left behind initially they were overflowing threatening in
their power to hamper your life to impact you at every turn now picture
them reduced in size no more threatening
just minor inconveniences now that you have scaled them in your mind
shrink the problems smaller still breathe deeply again and then out
breathing out the last of your connections to those problems and visualize them growing ever smaller
minut a fraction of their former size and you realize that your perspective
was clouded before your judgement of center your realization of the truth in
life and the importance of nature and your place in the world makes those
problems seem insignificant by comparison
[Music]
focus again on your breathing inhaling as you open up the chest exhaling as you
breathe out it is time to see the problems of life as mere obstacles it is
time to look to the important things in life and to step away from any doubts
regrets or anxieties that affect you negatively it is time to feel
contentment and to embrace pure inner peace drift gently now down to earth
close your eyes and feel your descent you are at peace with life and with
yourself finally you understand your
part within the universe drifting down
bathed in golden light as the Sun shimmers in the early morning sky the
faint warmth is comforting a beautiful start to the day it is time
to feel positive about your life you have the power to do so you are centered
you retain the feeling of peace and wonder you are now back in your own
reality imagine that you are back in your bed comfortable safe and secure
open your eyes and stretch out your muscles breathing deeply to send oxygen around
your body realize how good you feel right now
keep experiencing the wonderful sense of calmness and deep peace as you remember
your wonderful high time above the clouds a part of the midnight sky and
then a part of the early morning transition as night became day
understand now that your problems are such a small part of time and space and
even within your own reality understand
that your problems can be dealt with quickly and clearly with clarity of mind
breathing deeply and keep your sense of peace and tranquility breathe out slowly
noting that no tension remains remember
that you can return to this meditation whenever you need a renewed perspective
you are one with the universe
[Music]
