I am grateful you have chosen me to be
your guide today please subscribe to
this channel for more guided meditations
each week and consider sharing with
anyone you think can find value from
these videos and now I invite you to
make yourself comfortable
make any large shifts in your position
to find a resting place of ease take
your time make any small and subtle
adjustments to your body to fully relax
perhaps releasing your facial
expressions from around your eyes and
your mouth
allow all the tiny muscles in your face
and jaw to soften and let go
settle into ease
allow the settling to flow into your
mind as well
you
it takes time and patience to quiet the
busy mind just like stretching a muscle
requires relaxation to let the muscle
lengthen the mind requires relaxation to
slow down to make space
you
today we will intentionally attend to
our breath to bring about the relaxation
response to help let go of stress to let
go of any negativity that you may be
holding on to to let go of the need for
perfection and control and to let go of
anything else that may be limiting you
now I invite you to breathe in deeply
through your nose and breathe out
through your mouth
with a relaxed jaw making a sigh noise
continue breathing deeply for a few
cycles while observing your breath
as soon as all of your air is released
allow your next breath in
begin to notice the moment when your
exhale flows right into your inhale and
then when your inhale becomes your next
exhale
and on and on the flow goes like an
ocean wave coming into Shore and rolling
back out again
you may notice that your breath has
returned to its natural rhythm
we're not controlled the breath has an
automated tempo and depth
feel the sensation of being breathed
receiving the breath into your body
there is a force greater than us working
to send breath into our bodies and it is
our job to allow it to invite in the
breath
we can only control our breath for so
long before it returns to automation
the same is true in life
you
now moving your attention to each exhale
to breathe out is to let go of air to
let go of energy to surrender to the
natural rhythm of breath
for the next few breaths focus on each
exhale has a time to let go perhaps on
your next breath in make fists with your
hands and squeeze them tightly and as
you exhale literally let go of the
tension release your grip let go of
anything you're holding on to as you
breathe out
and feel the sensation ripple through
the rest of your body
and with each subsequent exhale let go
of what you no longer need
it may be pain it may be anger
it may be heartbreak
or it maybe control whatever it is for
you simply let it go
let go of tension
let go of any heaviness weighing on you
[Music]
[Music]
continue to attend to your natural
breath rhythm mindfully
[Music]
observing all you can about your breath
our breath is always with us and by
using it as a focal point we become
present
we cannot get back to a past breath and
we cannot breathe a future breath
the only breath we have is this one in
the present moment
by using breath as a focal point as part
of our meditation practice we develop
the conditioning to know that at anytime
we need we can simply shift our focus to
our breath perhaps during a stressful
interaction with a loved one while stuck
in traffic or as anxiety builds there is
no need to bring out the meditation
cushion in order to practice being
mindful we can simply and mindfully
breathe
and as we have practiced today our
breath has the ability to bring about
the familiar state of relaxation and
calm
[Music]
you
[Music]
with practice you will find that perhaps
this conditioned relaxation becomes your
reflexive response showing up naturally
and quickly
[Music]
breathing naturally brings oxygen to
your blood into your brain to bring
about the feeling of safety and with
this feeling of safety comes the
relaxation response
just like an intentional smile bring the
sensations of happiness mindful
breathing bring the sensations of calm
to the mind and body
stress and relaxation cannot exist
together
much like the way light cancels out
darkness
inviting relaxation into the body can
cancel out any remaining stress or
tension
your breath will bring a sensation of
release to each part of your body
and now imagine breathing into your
shoulders and neck
since the natural movement in this area
that is connected to your breath rhythm
like an ocean wave
can invite the sensation to move down
from your shoulders through your arms
and hands
visualize the movement of your breath
pulsing through each arm and hand to
relax fully
and by your breath to fill your chest
ribs and abdomen making space for energy
to flow freely
open your heart with a sense of
lightning
and then soften your belly
peel from the inside the flowing quality
of your breath as it travels the length
of your body
see the breath now moving down into your
hips and legs
relax your ankles and feet with each
wave of breath
and since the breath now in the soles of
the feet
sense the breath going to every cell in
your body
healing with life's energy
stay with your breath and the sensations
that come along with it
for the next few moments of silence
begin now to activate the muscles in
your face and around your eyes with an
intentional joyful smile feel the smile
wash over your face and notice what a
simple smile can do for how you are
feeling
continue to smile for a few more moments
feeling the sense of joy building inside
you
and when you are ready begin to bring
some gentle movements to your fingers
and your toes moving the energy through
your limbs
and when you are ready open your eyes
knowing that you can always come back to
your breath mindfully thank you so much
for listening
I hope you have a beautiful day
