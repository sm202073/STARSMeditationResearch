so find a comfortable position as we
begin and bring your attention to the
breath breathing deeply and fully for a
few moments
just enjoying the breath
[Music]
noticing any areas of tension now
[Music]
simply breathe and release without
judgment
[Music]
allowing the body and the mind to calm
and relax
take a breath and bring your attention
to the mind as we spend a few moments
observing your thoughts
many of your thoughts will be stressful
[Music]
by practicing observing your thoughts
you can become detached and reduce the
amount of stress that you experience as
a result of your thoughts
breathing deeply and fully
so just observing your thoughts and
practicing allowing them without
judgment or interaction
[Music]
and as you observe your thoughts
remember thoughts they are just the
stories that we tell ourselves all the
stories that others tell us so taking a
deep breath in remain detached from your
thoughts and continue observing them
[Music]
allowing them to pass
[Music]
no need to stop there
no need to even search for them
simply observe all existing thoughts as
you practice allowing them to pass
you
[Music]
[Music]
whatever your thoughts are at this time
by observing them and not interacting
with them by not repeating them or
following up with them you will begin to
experience less stress
and so taking a breath now let's shift
your attention to the body observing any
sensations or feelings that may be
present
[Music]
maybe feelings of extreme tension
[Music]
feelings of being physically stressed
[Music]
just observing without judgment
[Music]
whatever stress you're experiencing in
your life right now just observe and
allow it in the mind and in the body
[Music]
accepting the stress for what it is
there's no need to try and change
anything right now just accepting and
observing
you
[Music]
take a breath
[Music]
and except that while your stress is
real it is also temporary and it shall
pass
so taking another breath allowing your
thoughts to pass and just allowing any
situations to just be
[Music]
[Music]
just staying here with the breath
accepting that stress is a part of life
accepting that you find it difficult and
painful even just allow yourself to be
human
[Music]
and take another deep breath in allowing
the air to relax your body and calm your
mind
[Music]
breathing deeply and fully
[Music]
you
and in your own time when you're feeling
completely ready you can bring this
meditation to an end by simply opening
your eyes and taking a deep breath in
[Music]
