welcome to this powerful and versatile
guided meditation practice use this
before exercising to connect with your
physical experience
more effectively release anxiety and
stress
by improving your inner connection and
ground yourself
balance your energy and chakra centers
by creating a feeling of spaciousness
to move and balance your energy
i will invite you to feel your
experience
as you let go of the effort of doing
thank you for joining me i'm sarah
raymond from the mindful movement
as we begin i invite you to make
yourself comfortable
choose a seated position if possible
i will guide you to connect with the
length of your spine
and the space around it
it's preferable if your spine is
straight
and you can feel the weight of your
pelvis
on the surface below you
as you are ready close your eyes
to shift your awareness inward
to a sensing state
[Music]
use the contact and weight
of your pelvis on your support
to begin sensing
the sits bones are two bones at the base
of your pelvis that you sit on
let your awareness move here
as you notice your experience as it is
shift your weight slightly right
onto the right sits bone
then shift a little to your left
continue simply being aware of your
body's response
as you shift forward now
then shift backward
[Music]
do this slowly one more time in each
direction
while becoming aware of how your spine
and muscles respond to this
shift
[Music]
ultimately settle into a centered
and equally weighted position as best
your body allows
today
begin to sense the space directly
outside of your body
remember this is a practice of feeling
let go of words and labels
and connect with sensations and energy
sense the space on your right just
outside of your body
there is no wrong way to do this so
whatever you are feeling is exactly what
it should be
sense the space on your left
just outside your body
do you notice a sense of spaciousness
or congestion
no worries if your experience is
different
from one side to the other
in fact this is very common
notice now the space in the front of
your body
and notice in the back of your body
do you sense a free flow of energy
become aware of the space all around you
a 360 degree experience
shift your perception of your experience
to within your body now
with no specific location to scan
simply notice an area of spaciousness
where do you sense space
where energy flows freely
this introspection allows
for a strong connection
to your experience and energy
let yourself sense an area within
that feels the opposite of spaciousness
[Music]
perhaps it feels restricted
or clogged up
sense the difference between these two
experiences
within yourself
move your attention now to the area of
your spine
breathe into the length of your spine
[Music]
create expansiveness in your body
from the sits bones up to the crown of
your head
with each breath create space
[Music]
open to fluid energy
from top to bottom
now begin to breathe into the width
of your body
allow wide sits bones
hips ribs
armpits and even into
your head
each time you breathe in
fill up from side to side
and relax on each exhale
as you continue to breathe
you are intentionally creating
spaciousness
within the width of your body
now breathe into the depth
of your body
begin to fill up from front
to back
create space from front to back
sense and expansiveness from your navel
to your spine
from your chest to your back

from between your eyebrows
to the back of your head
this open space you have created
allows for a beautiful flow of energy
you have created an expansive channel
from the base of your pelvis
all the way to the crown of your head
take a moment to experience the free
flow
of energy
feel the shift from any areas that
previously felt restricted
as they move to spaciousness
fill up with energy anywhere you need
on each inhale
and let go of excess
or unwanted energy
with each exhale
the shift to feeling your experience
as you let go of the effort of doing
in this practice has great benefits
this allows you to connect with your
physical experience
more effectively to remain
calm
you are improving your inner connection
and balancing your energy and chakra
centers
enjoy these benefits for a moment longer

bring your awareness to the fullness of
your breath
once more
breathe in this flow state
this expansive energy

deepen your breath
allow yourself to begin moving back
to a fuller awareness
back to the space you are in

become aware of the energy in the room
around you
seek out the experience of your outer
world
yet remain relaxed
in your inner world
as you sense your surroundings
remain connected to the feeling
of ease in your body
and sense that it is always within you
now allow your attention to co-exist
in both your inner and your outer
experience

we will bring this meditative practice
to a close
with a deep inhale
and slow exhale
when you feel ready open your eyes
as always it is an honor to have the
opportunity
to practice with you may
you remain balanced and grounded
