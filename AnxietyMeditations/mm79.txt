it has been said that how you love
yourself is how you teach others to love
you to be the best person you can be to
have the ability to help and support
those loved ones surrounding you you
need to first love and care for yourself
the idea of self-care doesn't always
mean going out to the spa and getting
pampered it can also mean trusting your
heart and your intuition to guide you in
the right direction in life it means
taking the time to listen to your heart
and to your intuition often it is the
kind and compassionate way in which you
speak to yourself welcome to today's

your feet your toes and your ankles with
a loving relaxed awareness since your

lower back to be completely supported by
the surface below you
[Music]
feel as this state of ease moves further
up your body into your abdomen and your
chest feel this comfortable heaviness as
it moves into your arms and all the way
down into your fingers
and finally invite a release in the area
of your jaw and the small muscles in and
around your eyes and forehead and all
the way up into your scalp

areas that may still be holding on to
any lingering tension and again send

you on your journey to self-love let go
of judgments of yourself

expectations

of comparisons with others and with past
versions of yourself

let go of the belief that you are not
enough

let it all go
visualize all of this leaving your body
and your mind
to be gone from your life forever

deep nourishing breath filling up with
rejuvenating energy and breathe out
fully letting go
since the strong connection that you
have made with yourself here today
welcome more love into your life allow
the good to surface and outshine the
negative
and now begin to bring your awareness
back to the sensations in your body
notice the surface beneath you and begin
to sense the room around you

body from its relaxed State

state of relaxation start to gently move
your toes and feel the energy rush back
into your body like a warm way of coming
