No matter how much you try to think positive thoughts
and be optimistic about the future,
unpleasant thoughts will still arise.

You cannot avoid them,
and there is no use in pretending they arenâ€™t present.

Your mindfulness practice can help you
approach these thoughts with curiosity.

As you build an understanding
of your unpleasant thinking patterns,
they will no longer hook you in so strongly.

You can learn to allow them to be present
without letting them consume you.

This exercise is a practice in letting thoughts go
so that you are better able to do it when negative thoughts arise.

Close the eyes and tune in to the points of contact in the body.

Feel yourself grounded and stable as you sit.

Breathe deeply, feeling the body supported by the chair or cushion.

Pay attention to the experience in your mind.

Notice any thoughts as they arise,
and try to identify any emotions that go with them.
