welcome to the daily calm
let's start today's session by finding a
comfortable position with a tall
straight back
allow your arms to rest gently
when you're ready close your eyes
bring full attention
to this very moment
settling in
and allowing the mind and body to still
and with openness
patience
and curiosity
bring your awareness to the breath
a deep breath in
and releasing it fully
follow the breath as it flows in
and out
of your body
taking one last deep breath
before letting the breath settle
allowing it to feel natural and easy
don't try to force the breath or
regulate it in any way
just allow it to flow naturally on its
own
so
and we'll scan down the body now
concentrating our attention from part
to part
start by bringing your attention to the
top of your head and scalp
feeling whatever's happening in this
area
you might feel tingling or heat
throbbing or soft vibrations
there may be strong sensation
or you might not feel much at all
now lower your attention to your
forehead
face
and jaw
allow the muscles here to relax
on your next out breath
let that sensation dissolve
lower your focus to the neck
letting the throat
and sides and back of the neck soften
notice any sensation that arises on the
surface of the skin
or deeper within
now bring your attention to your
shoulders
noticing if there's any tension or
strain
breathe into your shoulders
and if any parts feel tight
allow them to relax
extend your awareness down the arms
towards the wrists
palms
and fingers
on the next out breath
allow them to soften
now come to the chest
observing the rise and fall of each
breath
notice how the lungs expand
and contract
direct your attention to your upper and
lower back
there may be some intensity is this is
an area where we commonly hold stress
if you notice any tension or warmth or
discomfort
just observe what's there
with each breath you take
soften just a little bit more
moving your focus around your abdomen
notice it expanding
filling up with air
and slowly emptying on the exhale
and bring your attention to your pelvis
notice where your body makes contact
with the ground
or your chair
and direct your breath into this area
relaxing into stillness
now scan your legs
observing your thighs
notice where they make contact with your
cushion or chair
lowering your attention to your knees
and your shins
and calves
let your legs soften
intentions release
when you're ready breathe
into your ankles
your feet
and toes
let them relax and become soft
sinking into a state
of relaxed awareness
and as we near the end of the session
take a moment to notice how you feel
you may find that you're more relaxed as
this is often a common outcome of
meditation
this is one of the reasons why it's so
helpful to meditate during times of
stress
when we're experiencing stress
our amygdala fires up and it's difficult
to make thoughtful decisions
so if we find our mind is clouded due to
overwhelm
we can use meditation as a tool to calm
the mind down
ideally we want to meditate in a
preventative way so we don't get to that
point
the practice is here for you whenever
you need it
and as we near the end of the session
bring your attention back to the room
wiggle your fingers and toes
and slowly
open your eyes
i hope you enjoyed today's daily con
i invite you to bring this state of
peace with you into the day
and we'll see you back here tomorrow
you
