lao-tzu once said nature does not hurry
yet everything is accomplished just as
the way water patiently erodes the
surface of Iraq we too can soften over
time when we follow the path of least
resistance and let go of our struggles
we add unnecessary suffering to our
experience when we want our reality to
be something other than what it really
is with patience for the process we can
release our resistance accept what is
and we can experience peace letting go
of resistance and experiencing
acceptance is an ongoing practice it is
one that can be especially difficult yet
extremely useful during challenging and
uncertain times slowing down and
discovering patience during meditation
is like training for our day-to-day life
experiences enjoy the process
be patient allow yourself to learn and
grow and trust the journey
hello and welcome I'm Sarah Raymond
thank you for joining me today let's
begin I invite you to make yourself
comfortable
close your eyes gently and take a
patient deep breath in and as you
breathe out allow your body to soften
in a moment I will guide you in a four
seven eight breath pattern then you can
continue the same pattern on your own
you will breathe in through your nose
for the count of four then hold for a
count of seven if you can or shorter if
you need then breathe out through your
mouth for the count of eight
and now to begin breathe out completely
now breathe in two three four hold two
three four five six seven breathe out
two three four five six seven eight and
one more cycle together breathe in two
three four hold two three four five six
seven breathe out two three four five
six seven eight and now continue this
pattern on your own for a few more
cycles
[Music]
[Music]
allow your breath to return to its
natural pattern and let go of the
Counting
[Music]
take a moment to simply notice how you
are feeling after practicing a few
deliberate relaxing breaths
[Music]
invite your attention to effortlessly
drift around your physical sensations to
notice your current state observe the
quality of the state you're in without
making any changes or judging where you
are simply check-in
are you calm
what is your heart rate like at this
moment
what are the sensations you are
experiencing in your body are you warm
or cool
what else is your attention drawn to as
the observer of your natural state
[Music]
what can you patiently discover about
yourself as you look inward on your
experience
[Music]
[Music]
now that you have observed your
unchanged experience scan through your
body once more look for anywhere you can
let go the tendency to hold on is there
anywhere in your physical body that you
can let go let go of tension let go of
tightness or pain
there may be areas that are holding on
that you weren't even aware of until you
patiently looked inward
today right now I invite you to welcome
more ease into your body
[Music]
what would it feel like in your body to
slow down and discover peace
[Music]
[Music]
what would it feel like to experience
calm
to be still
[Music]
breathe this in experience this right
now this stillness this calm state is a
time to go within
[Music]
life nature and every person experiences
a natural ebb and flow of energy an
inhalation period as well as an
exhalation period
[Music]
life is the balance of giving and
receiving of expending energy and
conserving energy it is up to you to
discover patience and Trust this journey
[Music]
as humans energetically we can learn
from the rhythms of nature
each of the seasons has its own energy
and symbolism that indicates where
nature is in its yearly cycle you can
learn from the seasons and their
energetic changes to help you move
through your own seasonal cycle and
energetic shift
each season has meaning and can invite
contemplation of the connections of
nature to your own experiences fall is a
time of letting go of what no longer
serves you letting go so you can welcome
in change and new beginnings winter can
be a time of stillness to go within
perhaps planning for the future and
nurturing what is important to you
and after the cold dark time of winter
spring brings a sense that your soul is
rested and at the same time spring
carries the promise of renewal like a
butterfly emerging from its cocoon
[Music]
summer is bursting with light and growth
and freedom
[Music]
these symbols of nature's seasons may
relate to different seasons of your life
the reminder is that everything changes
and goes through stages
no matter the season that you are
experiencing now consider the energy of
the seasons as you contemplate this
cycle in nature as well as your own life
what is your experience can you discover
the patience of nature and use it to
cultivate the same patience within
yourself
what would it be like to allow yourself
to slow down let go of resistance and
Trust the journey
[Music]
[Music]
fall can be a reminder for you to
acknowledge and accept the impermanence
and brief nature of things
winter encourages you to go within and
conserve your energy
while spring and summer offer the beauty
of new growth
the warmer months are a reminder to
appreciate all of the beauty that
surrounds us in this world tomorrow is
not guaranteed and we have the
opportunity to enjoy this moment and
live every day to the fullest
[Music]
the lessons and energy from each season
can change your mood it can change your
perspectives and therefore your choices
nature is a reminder to recognize that
all things change all things are
beautiful and perfect in their own
unique way at just the right time nature
doesn't rush its process all changes
happen seasons change and everything
gets accomplished without worry
[Music]
bring your awareness to the sensations
and energy of your body once more
take a patient deep breath in
and let it out as slowly as you can
since a building of energy within you
know that like nature the Sun shines the
light on what we may not have seen
before you have taken the time to go
inward to slow down and discover the
beauty of patience to recognize that you
can trust the journey you can welcome
the changes and stages of your life just
like nature breathe that in feel the
patients within you
when you are ready open your eyes let
the light in
trust the journey remember to slow down
listen observe and be patient look for
the seasons to change the energy to
change and be open to change with
acceptance trust the journey
thank you for practicing with me I hope
you patiently enjoy your day
