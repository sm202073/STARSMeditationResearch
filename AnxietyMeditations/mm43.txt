you gonna sit with me girl
am i live
all right
welcome welcome everyone thanks for
joining me
uh if you're new here i'm sarah raymond
with the mindful movement i'm
really honored to have you here
and if you are joining me again welcome
back
uh if you
if you have been here you might notice
that this is not my typical
space
i am outside
it is cold in maryland so i have my
my lovely
scarf that my daughter knitted for me
sorry crocheted excuse me she will get
mad that i said that
and uh we got a fire
and
here i am
i'm glad to be here
and i just want to take a minute to talk
a little bit about control so
we don't really have control
right like i don't have control over the
wind
tonight i don't have control over the
smoke that might blow into my face
or the dog's making noise or all of the
things
so
we do have choice
so i
decided i wanted to go live tonight i
made the choice that i was okay with
not having control over the lighting and
the space and the temperature and all
the things
and
i made the choice to
respond in a way that i could still feel
safe
and i could be okay with my choice
and that's the lesson or the the
teaching i'd love to
embody or impart in today's practice so
if you do hear the wind blowing then i
invite you to
sit with it
recognize how your body instinctively
responds
you might even
acknowledge that response
and see if you can still
work to calm
your body calm your responses as we go
through the practice so that's my my
intention my invitation for you and if
you have any other
intention for today's practice then
please honor that
and that being said
today's practice will be very gentle
not a lot of movement per se but
self massage
and various exercises to help you
regulate your nervous system or calm the
nervous system
and we're not going to get into a lot of
the science or the what's happening just
to feel into the experience
but i did leave a link in the
description box below the video
to two different books that are great
resources so if you do want to learn a
little bit more check those out
all right so let's jump right in
so make yourself comfortable i'm sitting
down obviously you're welcome to sit in
a chair if that's more comfortable for
you i would suggest being upright for at
least the first portion of it as we get
into the meditation then
you can
lie down
and i should mention that les is here
with us behind the camera
and he will be in the chat so if you
have any questions
comments please feel free to leave them
i'm just getting uh getting a signal we
all good
less
we're all good
someone's saying please rotate if
possible
rotate
and here is the
we don't have control over everything i
think we just have to go with it and
we're going to do the best we can
tonight
am i vertical
i think they can rotate it from their
device mine looks normal okay less is
saying
we just gotta go with the flow
you can rotate it from their device he
is saying you can rotate
from your device
i hope that helps
rotate on your device okay thank you
uh
we're gonna we're gonna go with the flow
tonight and i apologize if there's any
glitches or tech technical issues but
i hope that you enjoy the practice
okay so let's start with a
belly breath
as a way to just check in
so i like to have hands on my belly so i
can get a feel for
the movement there
nothing forced
nothing too strenuous just checking in
so if you feel like you want to close
your eyes you are welcome to do so
and then begin to breathe in through
your nose
sending your breath down into your belly
and as you breathe out you might like to
breathe out through your mouth like a
sigh
so you're making a sound
if that doesn't feel comfortable any
other breath pattern is fine
so taking a moment to check in
and what i mean by that is notice
the state of your body
the state of your mind
and you might even notice the state of
your nervous system
no judgment no need to change at this
point
just noticing
you might think of taking like a
snapshot in your memory of how you're
feeling in this moment
and then once you have that
baseline
let's blink our eyes open again if they
were closed
and then we're going to go into a little
bit of self massage and
everything that i offer is
just that it's an offering take it if
you like it
but listen to your body and if it's
saying
no this isn't so so right for me right
now just explore
see
what your body needs today
all right so we're going to start with a
a jaw massage so you can find the
indentation
at the jaw so it's about in line with
the earlobe
and pardon my dogs
you're gonna press your fingers into
your jaw
fairly firmly going inward
listen to your body and you decide how
much pressure is right for you
and then you can explore maybe circles
feel
great maybe just holding the pressure
feels good
perhaps you want to go up and down side
to side
you can open and close your jaw
you might take a nice deep breath in
and let it out like a sigh
relaxing the lower portion of your jaw
all right so if that feels great and you
want to keep going keep going otherwise
i'll move on to just um to the side of
your nose so you think of the the lines
that
are the crease of our
between our nose and our mouth you're
gonna go about the top of that
crease and you'll press in towards your
nose a bit
and then
once you have that pressure gently pull
out
so it's almost like you're opening your
sinuses
and then just like we did with the jaw
maybe circles feel
great or maybe up and down
i know it looks a little silly
but we can all be silly together
or maybe just hold the pressure
and here's a nice place to
gently pull out on the skin out on the
muscles and take a deep breath in
you might even feel you get more
air in
and let it go
again stay there a little longer if
you'd like otherwise we're going to go
to the corner inside corner of your
eyebrows
so
press pressing in gently
you might just let your head rest in
your hands
and then same options go here you can
move around in a circle it'll be a
pretty small circle
or just up and down
and side to side
and then again feel free to stay a
little longer
and then lastly we're going to go to the
ears so i'll give you lots of options
and you can choose what feels really
good
leave what doesn't
and we'll start inside of the ear so not
in the hole of your ear but in the on
the cartilage
and you're just going to kind of follow
the
line
follow
the different parts of your ears around
kind of like what you might
use a q-tip for although
you're not going to go inside the ear
canal
and then
i don't know if you can see this but
you're going to grab the earlobes and
just gently you can pull out you can
pull forward
and then work your way up
the side of the ear
and this area for me always feels really
nourishing really
relaxing
my dogs are going a little crazy
running around
okay and then just relax your arms by
your sides
if you want to close your eyes again you
can and let's take one more
check in
so
all we've really done is a little bit of
self-massage so just notice how that is
serving you
and just keep in mind
everyone's different your body is
different your nervous system is
different your personal history is
different from mine and anyone else
that's watching so your experience
in this practice will also be different
so just take what you like
and leave the rest
okay so a little bit more
nervous system resetting and then we'll
move into our meditation
so
you'll keep your
your eye gaze looking forward and then
i'll mirror you you can tip your left
shoulder excuse me left ear towards your
left shoulder
without lifting your your shoulder to
meet your ear so keep drawing the
shoulder down
there we go
and then
with your head still
take your eyes as far to your right as
you can
so it's almost like you're trying to see
your right ear with your head tipped to
your left
keep your eyes fixed right deep breath
in through your nose
let it out with a sigh
again
feel free to come out of this sooner if
you feel any need to do so
one more deep breath in through your
nose
out like a thigh
take your time bring your head back to
center eyes back to looking straight
ahead blink a couple times
and then we'll repeat in the other
direction
so your right ear towards your right
shoulder
and then
eyes looking as far to your left as you
can
breathing in
and out
three breaths if you can
come out of it sooner if you need to
ah
and then the head comes back up eyes
look forward blink a few times
and then
we'll
do a variation of that with a side bend
so i'm going to offer the side bend if
it's too much don't worry about adding
it
so we'll go back to left ear towards the
left shoulder
and then you might allow for a little
bit more of a side bend
so meaning you're
you're taking your spine over to your
left and if you still want a little bit
more your left hand can gently
uh
gently gently tug on your head
and then we'll take eyes now to the left
ear so you're looking towards the arm
that's up
my glasses always seem to be in the way
for this one
all right so about three breaths there
and as you breathe out through your
mouth think of relaxing your jaw
may even wiggle it side to side
and then take your time coming back
through center
and then other side so we go right here
towards the right shoulder
feel free to add a little side bend to
your right and then
option to take your right hand
gently very very gently we're not
tugging too hard here
and then eyes are going to your towards
your right ear
so it's kind of on a downward diagonal
about three breaths
uh
and then bring your
head and eyes back to center
okay
so
i feel a lot more calm than i did when
we started so i hope that you do as well
although it's not a requirement
obviously if that's not how you feel
that's your experience
but i would love to
guide you now into a meditation
so
if you prefer to lie down you are
welcome to do so make yourself
comfortable
and
if you prefer to sit up that's fine too
so
i like to think of posture as
something that we don't have to really
think about so get yourself into a
position that doesn't take a lot of
effort
but allows you to be in a
a straight spine position
and then
if you'd like you are welcome to close
your eyes you don't have to
we want you to feel safe
so if you choose not to close your eyes
maybe just soften your gaze downward
and then
just as we started take a moment to
simply notice
without judgment
without
the need to change
you might notice
the state of your physical body
state of your your mind your thoughts
you might become aware of
sounds
in your environment
sounds coming through
the video from my environment
and the practice that we just finished
we just went through is about
inner resourcing
about using your
own ability to
come into a calm state
and so
when
there is a noise
when there is a distraction
because there will always be
distractions
the practice is about coming back to
yourself
coming home to yourself
so with that in mind
let's
begin to move into a box breathing
pattern
so
we are taking a little intention
into
our breath
so we're breathing in
for a count
holding for the same count
breathing out
for the same count
and holding once more
so you might choose to start with a
count of three
or four
and just see how that feels in your body
so in your own time breathing in
holding
breathing out
holding
continue on your own for a few breaths
if you want to increase the length
the count of your breath that's fine
if you find you get distracted or lose
your count
simply start over
finish the
breath cycle that you are on
and just allow your breath to be natural
and see what you notice
are there sensations showing up in your
body
you might even ask yourself
is there a message here
as you notice my dog's barking notice
your response
can you
lovingly
start over can you lovingly
bring yourself home
to your experience
so in this
hopefully
calm and reflective state
you can ask yourself
what is it that i need
and just listen
no thinking no trying
just allow the answer to surface
what is it that i need
you might notice how your body your mind
your nervous system are all responding
to this question
when was the last time
someone asked you that
and how does it feel to be able
to ask yourself
to
connect with your
inner resources
so take another moment to just
notice what's there for you
and very gradually begin to let your
awareness brought in
you might start by noticing
the support beneath you
noticing
the air touching any exposed skin
[Music]
or perhaps you are able to sense the
energy around you
and
before you
open your eyes if they're still closed
see if you can sense
both your inner experience
and your
outer environment
the same time
and
as best you can keep that
awareness of both your inner
and
outer experience
as you
blink your eyes open if they were closed
coming back to full awareness
you might rub your hands together just
create a little warmth
i know it's a little cold out here for
me
and then taking the warmth of your hands
place the heel of your hands over your
eyes very gentle pressure
and then you might lean
your head the weight of your head down
into your hands
and just rest there for a moment
and
you can
let go of what you do not need
and then gradually
releasing your hands lifting your head
and i would just love to thank you so
