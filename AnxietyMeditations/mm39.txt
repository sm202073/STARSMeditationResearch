capacity to hold challenges or stress
this is the first in the series of
practices for your nervous system so be
sure to check back
for the other parts
this is the place to start
and you can come back to this practice
as often as you like to expand into a
peaceful and content state
perhaps
noticing less frequently the times where
you become overwhelmed or
stressed welcome to the mindful movement
i'm sarah raymond
in this practice i will offer a variety
of options to bring your mind into the
present moment
sense safety within your body
and invite your awareness to rest on
your physical experience
these are all options to explore
and build a toolkit for you to choose
from anytime you need
to make a shift in your state
now i invite you to make yourself
comfortable
seated upright if possible
let's begin
with your eyes open
look around your space
and in your mind
name one thing you see
and list three adjectives to describe it
for example
a table
that is brown
made of wood and has four legs
this will bring you into the present
moment
and send a signal of safety to your mind
and nervous system
next locate an exit from your space
and make a mental note
or map
of the space you are in
and when that is complete
if you feel ready
allow your eyes to close gently
take a long slow breath in
and let it out with a sigh
or ha
sound
do this a few more times on your own
beginning to settle
allow your breath to relax
to a natural rhythm
when you are ready
now with your right hand
begin squeezing
and releasing your left shoulder
gradually move down your arm
to your hand
press into the palm of your left hand
relaxing the entire length of your left
arm
and hand
be with the sensations you are
experiencing
feel all there is to feel
then move the squeezing action
back up
your left arm
to your shoulder
when you get back to your shoulder
let your arms rest
and notice if there is a difference in
how the two sides feel
continue breathing fluidly
as you complete the same sequence
with your left hand
starting
on your right shoulder
do this on your own
lingering on any area that feels good
be with the sensations
feel your experience fully
once you complete this side
allow both arms
to relax
and again
sense how you are feeling
recognize that you have the resources
within you
to shift your state
now if it feels right place one hand on
your heart
signaling love
and one hand on your belly
signaling safety
notice your natural breath
for a moment
without changing it
sense
it's rhythm
[Music]
and location
with a bit more intention now
begin to deepen your inhale through your
nose
send it low into your belly
and extend the length of your exhale
as long as you can
feel the movement of your breath
beneath your two hands
continue a few more
long
slow breaths in
and extended exhales
breathing at your own pace
allow your breath to
rest
in its natural rhythm once more
take a moment to sense
how you are feeling
and sense the state of your mind and
body
as you continue to relax deeper
leave one hand on your heart
and with the other
cup the side of your face
allow your face to
rest gently in your hand
in your mind say
i am okay
everything is okay
you can begin to softly rub your cheek
as you continue to say
i am okay
everything is okay
now allow your arms to rest
and sense the support beneath you
feel where your body meets the surface
you are sitting on
and allow this connection
to be grounding
sense that you are safe
recognize that you have made a shift
in your state
with your inner strength
and resources
let's close this practice
with a moment of gratitude for yourself
for your inner strength
and resources
you can be grateful for all that had to
align for you
to make time
and choose this practice
to nourish yourself
take another long slow breath in
and a cleansing breath out
there is no rush
slowly invite your awareness to broaden
to the space you are in
and the energy around you
when you are ready
open your eyes
and see your surroundings
from a new state of being
remember
any part of this practice can be
utilized on its own
whenever you need it
and stay tuned for the next parts of
this series for your nervous system
