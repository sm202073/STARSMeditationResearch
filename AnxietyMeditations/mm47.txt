this meditation will instantly reduce
the anxiety and fear that you are
feeling right now make sure that you are
sitting comfortably resting your hands
gently on your legs or in whatever
position is most comfortable for you if
you like allow your eyes to gently close
or focus them on an object in the room
just let yourself become as comfortable
and relaxed as possible
as you begin to settle in to this
meditative state focus your attention on
your breath feel the air move through
your nostrils as you simply let your
breath continue to flow in and out ever
so naturally
and as you breathe you may want to also
turn your attention to the air and your
lungs as you slowly push your belly in
and out along with your breath
just gently focus on this now
now as you relax and feel so pleasant
and comfortable soon we will begin to
speak some simple mantras that will
instantly help to calm your fear anxiety
or sense of panic
when you begin you may have felt some
uncomfortable feelings and you may feel
some of these uncomfortable feelings
still perhaps a tightness in your chest
or quickening of your heartbeat as you
continue through this session you will
feel your heart rate settle and a
wonderful sense of inner calm will
slowly come over you as you hear these
mantras slowly repeat them back to
yourself one by one
you can say them in your mind or if it
helps repeat them out loud whichever is
best for you
dedicate one or two full relaxed breaths
to each mantra and feel the powerful
weight of each word as you repeat them
continue to feel the air of your breath
gently move in and out as we begin now
either silently or outloud repeat after
me
as I breathe in and out I am aware of my
breath
I am aware of my heartbeat I am aware of
my body
you
as I breathe in and out I am aware of
the anxiety within me
I am aware of my fears
I am aware of any tightness in my chest
as I breathe in and out I am aware of my
negative thoughts
now I calm my negative thoughts
now I release my negative thoughts
as I breathe in and out I calm my
anxiety I calm my fear I release the
tightness in my chest
as I breathe in and out I relax my mind
I relax my body I slow down my thoughts
as I breathe in and out I release my
fears
I become free of my anxiety
I become free of suffering
I find peace
as I breathe in and out I let go
I like to go
I let go

you should now feel a wonderful sense of
calm throughout your body and in your
mind you are now liberated and free

tell yourself these mantras and
reinforce them but for now take a few
more moments to breathe in and out and
relax in this moment of peace and
stillness
