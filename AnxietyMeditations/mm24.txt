thank you for joining
me for this guided meditation to help
you relax
into the resistance the saying goes what
you resist persists if you stop and
think about how this applies to your
life you may find that this is true for
both your physical experience as well as
your emotional state the lesson is to
trust the experience accept what is with
respect of the journey and simply allow
letting go of worry expectations and the
need to be in complete control at all
times is the way past resistance being
mindful is the practice of noticing and
allowing the experience without judgment
as we begin to settle into our
meditation practice they invite you to
make yourself comfortable sit or lie
down in a way that allows you to find
ease in a position where you feel safe
to be supported by the surface below you
so you can completely let go of the need
to hold yourself up or to control your
posture
this intentional choice is sending your
brain a message that you are ready to
relax into the flow of this practice and
the flow of the energy of life
begin to make any small subtle
adjustments to your body to welcome the
relaxed peaceful state to wash over your
entire physical body and your
consciousness
as you are beginning to surrender into
the calm bring your attention to the
natural rhythm of your breath your body
and your brain are always working
together to breathe so you don't have to
constantly be thinking about it however
the simple act of mindfully attending to
your breath deepening your breath and
being intentional about it sends a
message that it is okay to relax
now is the time for inviting ease into
your body take an intentionally slow and
deep breath
and take another one
take your time filling up as much as you
can and slow down your exhale as well be
patient with your breath
feel as your next breath happens to you
easily and effortlessly
perhaps deepening and slowing down your
natural rhythm
and now simply allow your breath to
continue on its own
relax into your breath let it be
as your breath finds an easy natural
flow move your attention to your
physical body the intention as you scan
your body is loving compassionate
allowing of what is it is all part of
who you are
send an invitation to release what does
not serve you
slowly
bring your awareness to your toes since
this area without judgments or
expectations what do you notice
[Music]
what would it be like to relax this area
your intention to bring your awareness
to a specific part of your body gives it
permission to relax
by simply noticing you can find ease
moving your attention slowly up your
body as you sense the soles of your feet
you are ankles your calves and your
knees if there is any area of your body
that is speaking to you keep your
attention there a little longer breathe
into that area
invite a release
allow whatever you're feeling to be what
it is and to pass through you rather
than pushing it down
no need to label what you are sensing
simply experience it and allow it to
release and relax
take as long as you need attending to
each part of your body
perhaps you are ready to move your
attention up to your thighs
your hips
your abdomen and low back
our physical body holds on to emotions
and can be resistant to letting go by
attending to the sensations as they
arise breathing into what you experience
and patiently allowing they will pass
through you
then you will bring ease and comfort
into your body
what would it feel like to release the
pain and discomfort from your body
relax into the resistance
now move your attention to your ribs
your chest and your heart
open your heart
open the energy of your heart with
loving-kindness and compassion for
yourself and others this is a safe place
to let down the protective wall that has
perhaps been surrounding your heart what
would it be like to open your heart
to give your love and energy freely and
to be open to receive it back
if this brings up sensations or a shift
in emotions come back to the intention
of loving compassionate allowing of what
is let it be

release what does not serve you moving
your attention to your shoulders
your arms your hands

and fingers
continue to relax each body part as your
attention washes over it

since now the area of your neck and
throat
can you let go of any tightness holding
or guarding
can you find more space for the energy
to flow freely here what would it be
like
for this area to be open giving and
receiving of energy like the area of
your heart
sensing the release of your jaw
cheeks
eyes forehead
and scalp

take one more patient scan of your body
to welcome a little more love
compassion and relaxation to any areas
that may still need it
it is all part of what makes you unique
let it be
allow it
now that your body is relaxed
and you have let go of any tightness or
tension in your physical body
I will guide you to explore your
emotions mindfully know that you are in
a safe space and you can open your eyes
and stop at any time if you feel the
need to do so consider something in your
life where you may be experiencing
resistance simply recognize the emotions
arising that surround this experience
whatever you're feeling is okay
it is safe to be vulnerable right now
during your practice
during meditation
there is no guilt or judgments there is
no right or wrong
perhaps there is something you have been
denying for some time
know that whatever it is that you are
resisting is simply an obstacle on your
path it is part of your journey
these moments are opportunities for
learning and growth
because this may be a negative or
challenging emotion
do your best to let down your guard let
down your armor to what you are feeling
as it is make space for awareness
and acceptance
without judgment
this experience these emotions are part
of you and they are okay simply allow
know that
Worry has not solved any problems or
prevented any disasters worried brings
unnecessary suffering
and takes away from experiencing the
present moment to the fullest
resistance brings your energy to what
you do not want rather than what you do
want
what would it be like to trust the
situation and allow
as you continue to explore see deeply
into the situation
are there any recurring thoughts
images beliefs or stories associated
with this resistance
know that you are enough
trust and allow the experience
with love and compassion for yourself
and others for the next few moments
continue relaxing into the resistance
with patience
breathe into it

let it be
slowly bring your attention back to your
physical body
back to the surface below you bring some
gentle movements to your body to
re-energize you
as you are slowly coming out of the
state of relaxation know that you can
patiently continue to relax into the
resistance whether physical or emotional
come back to this meditation practice as
often as you need trust you are enough
allow mindfully and know that the
experience itself is not you let go and
rest in awareness itself things are just
as they are when you are ready open your
eyes with love and compassion for
yourself
