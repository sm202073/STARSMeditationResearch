hello and welcome to this 15-minute
meditation
to help reduce stress and anxiety
my name is jessica and i will be guiding
you through this meditation today
you may do this practice either seated
or lying down
whatever posture is most comfortable for
you
take a moment to get settled in
allow your body to become still
and relaxed
once you're settled in a comfortable
position
close your eyes and we'll take a few
deep cleansing breaths here to really
settle
into this space
exhale fully where you are take a deep
breath
in through your nose open your mouth
and slowly exhale the breath out
let's do that twice more take a big
breath
in feel the air travel down your throat
to your belly
open your mouth big exhale out
once more breathe in through the nose
fill the lungs fully
and then open the mouth exhale all the
stagnant
air and energy out
now let your breath flow however it
wants to
coming back to your natural rhythm
bring your entire focus to your breath
and
really pay attention to how your lungs
expand
and contract when you inhale and exhale
now close your mouth and begin to
breathe deeply in
and out through the nose
encourage the exhales to be a few counts
longer than the inhales
as you continue to breathe slowly
and comfortably turn your attention to
your body
notice how you're feeling physically
without trying to change anything simply
become aware of the sensations
in your body
all you need to do right now is observe
[Music]
remind yourself that however you are
feeling right now
is okay
begin to scan your body beginning at the
top of your head
and moving downward
turn your attention to your head and the
muscles in your face
observe any tension
now breathe into the sensations in your
jaw
your cheeks your forehead
the temples
and as you exhale allow it all to
release
soften the muscles in your face
[Music]
moving your attention downward to your
shoulders
arms and hands
noticing each area and observing how
your body feels
now breathe into the sensations of your
upper body
as you exhale let go of any weight
you're carrying
in the shoulders relax
the elbows the fingertips
the arms are heavy
feel a sense of calm
and release
keep scanning gradually moving near the
center of your body
at the level of your stomach
feel the ribs the sides
and the back side of the body as you
breathe
how are these parts of your body feeling
observe your physical state
with your inhale feel the belly expand
like a balloon
and as you exhale expel the air out
and feel the belly contract
move the focus of your attention
downwards
reaching the level of your hips
notice any stiffness or tension
without trying to change anything
be with how you feel
again inhale and this time
imagine that you're breathing in new
life
new space into your hips and the low
back
[Music]
as you exhale let all stress and tension
completely melt away
reaching the level of your knees keep
scanning
all the way down to your feet
feel the legs as a whole
[Music]
breathe in sending the breath down the
legs and
feet and as you exhale the body
sinks relaxes
[Music]
let's go
[Music]
feel your body grounded down into the
earth
take another breath in
[Music]
and when you exhale feel yourself let go
of
any worries
notice how relaxed you are becoming
right now
[Music]
allow your breath to flow naturally
and let yourself feel calm
and at peace
[Music]
you deserve this wonderful feeling of
serenity
you deserve to feel calm
you deserve to be at peace
focus now on your thoughts
[Music]
notice your calm thoughts enjoying this
present
relaxing moment
now see how you can focus your thinking
to a state of complete calm by
meditating on a single word
meditate now on the word relax
by mentally saying relax
[Music]
each time you breathe in
and each time you breathe out
breathe in relax
breathe out relax
[Music]
breathe in
breathe out
continue breathing saying in your mind
relax with
each breath in
and again with each breath out
[Music]
know that it is normal for your thoughts
to wander
and as they do just focus again on the
word relax
keep repeating this word as you breathe
[Music]
keep repeating this word noticing how
you are completely
relaxed and calm
drifting off into a pleasant state
of inner bliss
[Music]
now simply allow your mind to drift
you don't need to focus on anything at
all
just rest and relax
[Music]
enjoying this calm state you are in
remember that feelings such as stress
or anxiety are simply just that
feelings they are not
who you are they are not your identity
they are simply emotions that come up
every once in a while
instead of resisting learn to welcome
your thoughts and feelings
accept them and then
feel how they float away
[Music]
the more you practice this awareness of
your thoughts and feelings
the more often you can allow your brain
to start
establishing and strengthening new
pathways
that will help you stay more mindful and
[Music]
balanced
[Music]
when you're ready bring your attention
slowly back to your breath
[Music]
moving gently begin to wiggle the
fingers
and the toes
keep your eyes closed and softly bring
the hands to heart
center prayer position
[Music]
take a moment to find gratitude
[Music]
thank you for joining me for this
meditation practice
i hope that it leaves you feeling calm
and relaxed in your body
and mind and i hope you have a wonderful
rest of your day
