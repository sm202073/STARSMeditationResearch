I want to thank
you for taking the time to honor yourself with this meditation I am
grateful that you have chosen me as your guide by using your breath as an anchor
you can get grounded in the present moment at any time in your life and
today we will practice the skill of being present and now I invite you to
make yourself comfortable and begin to relax you can choose to be seated or lie
down with your back straight allow your
eyes to close gently and begin to notice your breath you have
chosen to take this time to honor yourself in a positive way you are
bringing mindfulness to the way that you live you are strengthening the
connection between your body and your mind today you will build the skill of
mindfulness and living in the present moment [Music]
now without making any changes to your breath simply notice how it flows in
through your nose and fills up your body with life
[Music]
follow the flow of the air as it goes into your body through your nostrils
[Music] and notice how your chest and abdomen
rise and fall naturally as the breath
comes in and goes out [Music]
this breath will be your anchor and keep you rooted in the present moment during
this practice and beyond [Music]
when you focus on your breath you are always focused in the present moment you
cannot get back a past breath and you cannot breathe in a future
breath before the present moment [Music]
as you continue to stay with your breath as an anchor to the present moment allow
it to flow naturally [Music]
releasing any physical and emotional tension with each exhale
[Music]
and now begin to deepen each breath in
and out [Music]
as your breath fills you up more fully [Music]
invite your attention to rest on the space that comes between the inhale and
the exhale [Music]
and as you focus your attention on this stillness allow it to last a little
longer pausing
holding the breath momentarily between the inhale and the exhale
[Music]
breathe in this way for three more cycles of breath
attending to the stillness the pause [Music]
and feel as the tension melts away from your body
[Music]
give yourself permission to be fully supported by your surroundings and be
open to the possibilities of what comes with this state of comfort
[Music] allow your mind to quiet
[Music] and the noises and the responsibilities
of the world around you to turn off [Music]
as you still may have thoughts going through your mind
notice them from afar as if you are an
observer [Music] and by the space between your thoughts
to extend [Music]
just as you did with the space between your breaths
[Music]
in just a moment you are going to continue this practice of awareness as
you bring your attention to your physical body in order to relax
each part of your body beginning at the top of your head moving
all the way down to the bottom of your feet
I will guide you through this process and as you hear each part of your body
being spoken you will first bring your
awareness to that area simply noticing
how it feels without judgement [Music]
and then you will relax that part deeply [Music]
and now turn your attention to the top of your head
first visualize and feel your scalp and
head [Music]
and then welcome in relaxation [Music]
as you begin to progressively release each muscle notice how powerful your
awareness is [Music] and how just a thought in your mind can
have the ability to relax your entire body so deeply
[Music]
continuing the scan of your body feel
your forehead soften and smooth
since your eyebrows and your eyes [Music]
as they began to melt
noticing the tiny muscles around your eyes release
perhaps you can feel that your eyelids are becoming very heavy
notice your cheeks soften 
allow your teeth to part 
unclench your jaw and relax your tongue
feel your throat softening 
and notice as your neck let's go of any held tension
invite this relaxation to move into your
shoulders feel the warm comfort moving
downward as the tension melts out of your shoulders moving down your arms and
flowing out of your body through your fingertips
with each breath notice the contraction and expansion of your abdomen and chest
as the sensation of heaviness washes over you
now allow your chest to relax completely
perhaps you notice how deep and calm
your breath has become as you continue
to relax even more 
what other sensations do you notice in this moment

the simple process of noticing your breath
noticing your physical body and your surroundings
[Music] is such a powerful tool for relaxation
and stress relief bringing you into the present

notice as this comfort begins to move down your body now releasing the tension
from your lower back and your hips
your thighs feel heavy and sink into the
surface below you
your knees soften 
and you allow your calves to melt 
and as your body continues to rest your ankles and feet let go of any remaining
tension your body feels to be completely
relaxed to be safe and supported you now
allow yourself to drift even further
into a deep state of relaxation letting
yourself go completely 
as you continue to be aware of your breath and your physical body in this
moment follow the sound of my voice on this
journey of relaxation 
take notice of any thoughts or distractions that may come into your
mind simply acknowledge the thought and
allow your breath to carry it away
now as you continue to relax begin to
use your imagination and see yourself on
a soft fluffy white cloud 
this cloud is special and it is just for
you when you lay down on this cloud it fits
you perfectly it supports you entirely
so you can let go of any need for holding on 
as you rest on this cloud you will safely take a journey as it drips you
off to your favorite place this is a
peaceful place with your imagination
see this beautiful place in vivid detail
this place may be a place that you have been to before or one that exists only
in your imagination
here you are happy calm and at peace see
yourself here take in all of your surroundings use all of your senses
listen to the sounds 
smell the smells
feel that the temperature around you is the perfect temperature for you
[Music] and know that when you are in this perfect peaceful place nothing bad can
happen you are safe you are supported
you are completely in control
I am simply your guide
here in this deeply tranquil state
incredible changes can be made with your subconscious mind in this place you are
more in touch with yourself then you have ever been before [Music]
in just a moment I am going to count down from ten to one and as I do you can
allow yourself to relax completely on this soft cloud feel comfortable in this
special place on the cloud allowing yourself to go deeper and deeper into
relaxation [Music]
each number you hear will bring you
deeper into comfort and as I begin to count welcome the
state of relaxation 10 you are a letting
go completely 9 you are deeply relaxed

and tension seven your entire body
softens six give yourself permission to
let go [Music] five drifting down deeper and deeper

each number [Music] three

relaxation 
now as you continue to relax and enjoy your peaceful place you can follow my
voice as a guide or let me fade into the
background as you continue to relax and simply be

you will hear me speak statements or ideas to contemplate
[Music] that will support you on your journey to
personal truth with these positive
statements settling into the deepest part of your subconscious you will be
wonderfully surprised at your increasing self-confidence
