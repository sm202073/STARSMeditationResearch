today's meditation is a
blissful pause that can be a cherished
break taken at any time you need it it
will invite you to rest your attention
on the present moment and to slow down
from the fast-paced and sometimes
stressful schedule we might create for
ourselves while it might not be
realistic to alter the components of our
life or the potential stressors we can
take time to pause connect with the
present moment and recharge this pause
is a sacred strategy that will help you
to meet the demands of your life with
more ease and peace I will guide you
through today but know that I am simply
helping you to connect with yourself in
this present moment you have everything
you need inside you already and you can
practice this in the future any time you
would like take this time to come home
to yourself settle and balance your
equilibrium as we begin I invite you to
make yourself comfortable
close your eyes if you'd like and if it
feels right to you bring your hands
together in front of your heart begin
this practice by honoring yourself and
the time you have carved out from busy
life for this pause to cherish the
present moment may you experience peace
joy and a strong loving connection with
yourself
may this pause invite you to cherish all
that you are and all that you have in
this moment
and now allow your hands to rest by your
sides in an easy and effortless posture
and bring your awareness to your breath
[Music]
begin to breathe in deeply through your
nose and out fully through your nose
fill up your lungs completely and notice
a sense of letting go as you breathe out
an intentional relaxation of your body
and mind
[Music]
and breathe in again
and out
[Music]
count the length of your next full
inhale and match the length of your next
exhale continue to breathe with equal
counts for a few cycles
[Music]
as you continue your equal parts breath
notice the natural pause between breaths
invite the length of the pause to gently
extend without forcing
feel the sense of fullness as you pause
after your next inhale
[Music]
and welcome the feeling of letting go
as you exhale as you release all the air
you may also sense with each pause of
your breath
there is a corresponding space between
thoughts and your mind
notice the parallel of the pause of your
breath
with the pause between your thoughts
[Music]
now allow your breath to return to its
natural pace notice the intuitive rhythm
and flow your body has as you breathe
perhaps do you feel a gentle rise and
fall of your abdomen
[Music]
maybe you can sense the connection of
your breath with your heartbeat
simply notice what is there for you
right now
[Music]
meet your present experience with
permission rather than resistance or an
expectation that something needs to
change
[Music]
arrived in this present moment with
unconditional acceptance of your
experience
[Music]
what would it be like if you chose to be
in meditation rather than do a
meditation
[Music]
what does this idea feel like in your
body
[Music]
can you be here in a state of relaxed
consciousness
come home to yourself in this moment
home is this pause this cherished and
blissful connection to yourself
[Music]
welcome peace in the stillness the
stillness between breaths and between
thoughts
the stillness of simply being
[Music]
no need to change or force anything
simply be
[Music]
notice the sensations in your body as
you invite your relaxed awareness to
scan within yourself from the inside
[Music]
meet yourself right where you are with
kindness and care
[Music]
if you find your attention drawn to
areas of typical tightness or discomfort
[Music]
offer a bit of loving kindness and
acceptance for this part of yourself
[Music]
know that it is just that part of you
come home to yourself just as you are
with love connect with your true self
with love and acceptance
[Music]
awake to the sensations in your body
[Music]
what are the sensations in your hands
and in your feet right now feel the
aliveness the energy moving within you
perhaps buzzing or vibrations
[Music]
the attention to your sensations lets
you live in this body it invites you to
sense your own aliveness in this present
moment
[Music]
when your mind is attentive to the
sensations of your body you can pause
you can extend the gap between your
thoughts
this cherished pause is where you can
experience peace and calm in the now
[Music]
stay with the experience of your
sensations and the calmness between
thoughts and breaths for a moment longer
[Music]
know that you can always come back to
this state of quiet because it has
always been a part of you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
begin to broaden your awareness outward
since the air around you as it makes
gentle contact with any exposed skin
[Music]
take in a full breath and let it out as
slowly as you can and do this again
letting go of your breath releasing any
held tension
as many times as you need come back home
to yourself start over with your
awareness of the present take a
cherished pause anytime you need it to
do this slow down pause in the gap
between thoughts the gap between breaths
