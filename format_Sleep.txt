yourbodybegin to open your senses up to the world around you beginning with yourears start to become mindful of the quiet space that is around you and ofany sounds that pass through this sense of

journey into the peace of the oceangently guiding you towards a restorative and peaceful sleep during the course ofthis journey you will first come into contact with the peace that exists righthere in the present moment before being guided to open yourself up to a deeperdescent underwater all that is requiredof you now is a willingness to open yourself up to the possibility ofcomplete inner harmony take a few grounding breaths now as webegin this exploration allowing your heart and chest to soften with eachbreath that you take [Music]now take a few moments to make any necessary adjustments to the physicalbody moving yourself in such a way to allow relaxation to flow effortlesslythrough your being if there is any tightness lingering around the chest orthe stomach or your shoulders or anyother part of your body quietly make note of this tension and then gentlyrelease it on the next breath out [Music]straighten your neck soften the area around your eyes as you consciouslybegin to release all physical tension you prepare yourself for the journeyinto deep release and peace[Music] now before we journey anywhere let'stake some time to become more intimately aware of the environment around and within us begin by simply drawing yourawareness to the physical body and each area of it that is in contact with thephysical support beneath you you might notice the entire back side of your bodybeing completely supported by the bed or the cushions or the blankets underneathyou just take a moment to simply draw your attention to each area of contactherenow consider areas of the body facing upwards towards the ceiling that arealso in contact with the material world noticing items of comfort that might bedraped over the top of you and then seeif you can finally tuned in to the invisibility of air that surrounds yourbody noticing if you can feel it against your skinin these observations there is no need to search for some specific form ofexperience or result simply allow any arisings to be witnessed[Music]draw your attention now to the belly as you observe the way it rises and fallsas you inhale and exhale [Music]even if sensations of the breath within a more subtle we can typically observetheir presence in the form of movement once we draw our attention to this lifeforce so allow the rest of the body to remain still as you focus for a fewsilent moments on the rising and falling of your coreuse your breath as an anchor when needed throughout this meditation even when youdescend into the depths of the ocean in this visualization the breath is alwaysavailable to provide you with grounding support and connection to this physicalexistence and if at any point the mindwanders becoming preoccupied with stories fears or judgments or chatter ofany sort you can once again turn to the breath or to my words to refocus yourattention it's entirely natural for our minds to wander so there is no need tocondemn this tendency in any way when distractions occur simply take a deepbreath refocus your attention and settleinto this act of self-care once againas you watched the breath moving into and out of your bodyallow a sense of tranquility to overcome your entire being of seeminglyparadoxical the breath is both like an anchor and like the waves they are onein the same as we learn to ride the waves of breath and of life we movetowards the discovery of complete presence and stillness no matter howstill we bring ourselves to be waves will still come just as the breath willstill come movement is a part of life how we react to those movements is wherewe discover our power to maneuver ourselves in this world peacefully andcalmly so before we descend into theocean take a few moments of silence to effortlessly move with the rhythm ofyour breath the body will remain still while the present moment continuallyshifts sink into this peaceful movement for ashort while now[Music]take this moment to tune into the space between the brows into the Mayans Iallow all thoughts and images to melt away as you focus your attention solelyon the empty space before you the world around and within becomes quiet as youprepare for a journey into the depths of the ocean upon this blank slate beforeyour mind's eye begin to visualize yourself at the edge of the ocean yourbare feet are nestled into the sand as you stare out the vast sea before youtake a few moments to observe the sensations present what do your eyesnoticeyou what sounds to your ears pickupwhat smells fill the airhow does your body feel how does your heart feelas you begin to relax into this space eel the ocean air filling the entirecavity of your lungs as you inhale and then releasing all unnecessary stressand tension from your physical body as you exhale stare out at the open sea asyou witness every knot and contraction dissolving[Music]you take a few steps forward so that as the waves brush up against the shorethey cover your feet observe the naturalrhythm of the waves steady though ever-changing just like the breath theycontinue to flow in and out inand outthe ocean slowly becomes influenced by your breaths natural rhythm slowlycoming to meet your own unique flow youstart to feel yourself to be in total harmony with the vast abyss in front ofyou something inside of you whispersview to venture into the water so you start to move slowly and gracefullyforward step by step you wade out untilsoon your calves are submerged and then your kneesyour thighs and your waist you standwaist-deep as you prepare to dive below[Music] stretching your arms out before you you take a deep breath a small jump and thendive forward with grace and these you are now completely submerged as youglide through the water extending both arm fords and then swooping them out tothe sides to propel you further you notice that by divine magic you are ableto breathe beneath the water small gills have developed and you come to realizethat you are neither of this world nor the human one you are otherworldly agreat wave of relief washes over you as you realize you had been yearning toexplore this underwater palace with easeyou continue to breast to stroke your way through the ocean feeling completelysafe and accepted within this new kingdom [Music] you absorb every new side every colortexture and shape of the sea life you pass[Music] seahorses brightly striped fish and evensmall shark swim around you none of them posing any threat to you in this magicalenvironment you breathe naturally andeffortlessly underwater your body feels light and free completely supported witheach and every movement you make withevery drop of water that soon passes over your body old stories anddetachments are released soon nothingremains but a sense of oneness you are aligned with the oceans movementsgliding with gracenow something appears to be approaching you from straight ahead though youcannot make out what the creature is your intuition tells you it is notthreatening the pair of eyes move closer and closer until very soon you know thefigure to be a dolphin that is making its way toward you the dolphin slows asshe approaches stilling herself just a few feet ahead of youyou too have ceased movement now floating effortlessly in the open abyssof the great sea both pairs of eyes meetas you take a few silent moments of pure awareness here you can sense that yourenergies are in harmony and that you have attracted one another for a reason[Music]though the dolphin speaks a different language in sound the vibrations relayher message she reminds you that it is possible to be both compassionate andgentle while harnessing a deep and authentic source of inner strength whenembodying these two principles the way dolphins do body and mind relaxcompletely knowing that the paradoxes in life do not have to bring strifestrength and compassion can co-exist they can be one in the samethe dolphin breaks her gaze as she swims off to the side and begins to swimplayful circles around you she sings out to the sea reminding youthat it is okay to lighten up to play and to be who you really are as shesings you feel her vibrations radiating into the core of your being in thismoment you know you are forever changed for the better balance and harmony havenow made their way into your burns rather than remaining an idea digestedby mind alone [Music]the dolphin slows and comes back for one more brief moment to gaze into your eyesa subtle smile overcomes her face beforeshe flutters away disappearing into the darkness ahead of you you breathe deeplyfeeling her still very much present within you [Music]she has blessed you with a wisdom and the gifts gifts that now live within youyou look above and notice you are not too far from the surface of the oceanthe sunlight trickles in to remind you to come back to the human world thoughyou have enjoyed your time in the depths of the ocean you know you must nowreturn as you swim slowly and calmly up towardsthe light you feel every last grain of tension fall from your body sinking downto the ocean floor to be renewed youfeel light and free having no remaining weightiness in your body or mind as youbreak through the barrier of water that opens up to the open sky your gillsdisappear and you notice what it is like to breathe like a human once againfloating on your back you take a few deep breaths into the belly feeling asense of calm filling you completely [Music]visuals of the ocean begin to disappear from your mind's eye as you tune in onceagain to the support and strength of the physical world beneath your body thoughthe ocean and a dolphin are now behind you they are forever within your heartand spirit allow this earthly world tosupport you once again the feeling of peace freedom and calmness that theunderwater world blessed you are still within you you will carry them intosleep as you surrender effortlessly into the coming slumber[Music] follow your breath acknowledging it tobe both wave and anchor as you melt intothis present moment completely welcoming another restorative night's sleep thereis nothing left to do but to grant your body in mind permission to releasethemselves for another night follow yourbreath now in silence allowing it to guide you into a deep and peaceful sleep[Music]welcome to this guided meditation which is designed to help you slow your racingmind and then lead you gently into a soothing and restorative sleep over thenext little while I invite you to simply follow my voice as you come toexperience a profound sense of silence within take a few deep breaths now tosettle yourself into this space and soon and we will beginit is not uncommon within our fast-paced modern lifestyle for the mine to be onconstant overdrive even when we bringthe body to rest mental chatter often persists one of the primary reasons thatwe have trouble easing our way into sleep is because of this feverish sideof the mind whether it is caught up in the past events or is living 20 stepsinto the future the mind has a way of pulling us out of the present moment itkeeps us stimulated and engaged even when we want to try to slow down whenthe mind is constantly on the go deep rest is put on holdbefore we begin navigating this side of the mind exposing it in such a way thatcalms and soothes it let us take a few moments to come into a comfortable lyingdown position and just taking your time to stretch and release the body in anyway that feels restorative and to adjust your positioning with cushions orblankets as you require and once you aresettled see if it is possible to straighten the neck if it is curved atall bringing a gentle oneness across the chest breathing in and exhaling[Music] grounding yourself into the physical space beneath and around you so takesome time now to really connect with your breath becoming intimate with theway it passes through you as you inhaleobserve every sensation as the air trickles in first entering your nasalcavity passing through the trachea and then settling into the depths of yourlungs and as you breathe out observe themoment in Reverse as your breath returns to the world around you notice yourbreaths rhythm and depth [Music]without changing it in any way for the time being simply observe its flownoticing where it extends to and how fast or slow it moves as we move throughthis meditation remember that your breath is always available to helpanchor you in this present moment if distracting thoughts arise which theywill allow the breath to guide you back down to your body to your directexperience of the now [Music]take a moment now to simply draw your attention to your stomach notice the waythe belly moves as you breathe risingand falling throughout the cycle of your breath as you draw your attention tothis area of the body you might notice that the breath naturally deepensif so open yourself to this consciouslyrelease any constriction in the abdomen to help guide the flow of air deep intothe belly [Music]when how Mayans run uncontrollably our bodies assume a state of stress engaginga defense mechanism known as the fight-or-flight response when the bodyis engaged in this way the breath loses its depth hovering in the more shallowcavities of the lungs hormone surge asthe body prepares to defend itself inorder to counterbalance this surge of stress hormones and to soften thereaction within the body we can engage in what is known as the relaxationresponse to help the body and mind to slow down by consciously drawing thebreath into the belly we invite this counter response to take over easing theracing thoughts that stimulate the physical bodytake a few moments of silence now to deepen the breath in this way guiding itinto the fullest capacity of the lungs so that it presses into the abdomen ifyou find it challenging at first to deepen your breath all the way this isentirely okay over time the breath will soften and thelungs will expand for now just see howfar the breath is capable of going as you slowly breathe in and slowly breatheout [Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]thoughts may continue to rise from time to time but there is no need to panic orself judge if they do the mind may attempt to add fuel to the fire bycriticizing telling the self that it should not be thinking refrain fromgiving in to this common reaction reminding yourself that is natural forthoughts to arise and then compassionately releasing whatever hascome up[Music][Music] thinking is a natural function of the mind and as such it cannot be forced tocease entirely however we can begin toexpose our racing thoughts by observing them from a new place and with the freshlens as we uncover their nature we beginto distance ourselves from them and from the stories that they spin so now Iinvite you to open your heart to the truth that you are not your thoughtstake a few breaths here on your own repeating the following words in silenceI am NOT my thoughts I am NOT mythoughts allow yourself to openwholeheartedly to the truth that your thoughts do not define you[Music][Music]notice the way that the mind can be redirected in such a way flowingalongside your attention it can taketime to catch the mind when it escapes but we continued practice it is possibleto refocus again and again on the directexperience within this present moment any time the mind wanders simplyacknowledge its movement with compassion and curiosity there is no reason tocriticize or condemn the uprising of thought instead practice observing theinner dialog from a distance when younotice yourself becoming entangled in the minds story simply notice what hashappened and draw your attention back to your breath[Music] continue to follow each inhale and eachexhale as you continually re-establishyourself in the present moment [Music][Music] it is possible to further de-escalatethe power of your thoughts by beginning to label them whenever they arise thissort of labeling should not be based in judgment such as being defined by wordssuch as good or bad or spiritual or an spiritual rather rising thoughts can beobserved according to the action that they represent for instance you mayassign certain words to your thoughts such as thinking planning denyingcriticizing or worrying after you labelthoughts in this way allow the wave to disappear and then return to your breath[Music]practice this again rooting yourself through the breath and becoming moreaware of the nature of your thoughts not of their content witness the way theymove and the nature of these movements[Music][Music]other actions you might notice include hoping feeling dreaming and arguingcontinue to quietly observe whatever arises coming back to your breath inbetween rising thoughts[Music]youyouyou might also observe physical sensations labeling them as pressuresoftness tingling or warmth continue tonotice whatever you notice allowing single words to disengage and trancingstories[Music][Music][Music] continue to come back to the naturalrhythm of your breath in between observations breathing in breathing outcontinually refocusing your attention on this innate flownow let whole words and thoughts subside as you come deeper into the physicalsensations of the body take a moment toscan the body gently drawing your awareness first your toes before veryslowly moving upwards throughout the visceral body and as you pass each areaallow that part of the body to soften bysimply focusing on a particular area and by using the power of your attention torelease all of the associated muscles the physical body relaxes and the mindrelaxes even further alongside it[Music] continue to work your way up slowlyreleasing or constriction and tension that is held within the body breatheinto each body part blessing your physical being with love and compassion[Music] when you reach the head area pay specialattention to the jaw to the eyebrows andto the forehead allow each of these muscle groups torelax observing the difference between felt contraction and releasenow draw your attention now to the space between your brows to what is oftenreferred to as the third eye area and asyou hold your attention on this spot consciously keep the muscles around itrelaxed and breathe into this space forjust a few breaths noticing any sensations or visuals that might bepresentnow gently envision a light blue glowbeginning to appear in this space it is soft and soothing gently pulsating inthis space between your eyebrows and as it expands it touches every cellof the mind space dissolving all thoughts as it pulses[Music]you might notice yourself beginning to feel quiet tired finally feeling free ofyour thought waves and feeling ready to relax deeply you might also like to feelinto this release through a deep sigh exhaling all tension out of the bodyuntil nothing remains in your attention aside from this healing blue light[Music] once all thoughts have been dissolvedthis orb of energy begins to shrink butnot disappearing entirely now this softblue glow appears as a pearl pristine clear and sparkling it hovers in thespace between the brows for another moment and you come to witness a deepand profound silence within its presencesit with this silence for a few moments observing the peace and tranquility thispearl of light has brought to your inner being[Music][Music] the soft Paul begins to descend movingvery slowly until it reaches the throat and thenfloating a little further still until it lands in the heart it pauses herebringing its energy of stillness and tranquility to the heart space all issilent now or has been brought to peace [Music][Music] the work of this blue light is nowcomplete and so very slowly it dissipates into nothingness you feelcomplete serenity in this very moment knowing that you have been freed of allracing thoughts the mind is at peace theheart is at peace and your body is atpeace [Music]continue to breathe as you begin your final descent into sleep allow thenatural rhythm of your breath the slow and steady waves of each cycle to gentlyguide you into restorative slumber theworld within you and around you is quietany subtle sounds begin to fade away asyou slowly transition into a deep and peaceful sleepinhale and exhale slowly deeply untilvery soon this waking day has faded

out[Music]just become attuned to the natural flow of the breath as though observing thebreath the full length of each breath in and out[Music][Music] as you begin to settle take a moment towitness the entirety of your body and mind our thoughts often when we wake wecarry fragments of our dreams and wehold on to thoughts about the days behind and the days ahead of us sosimply begin to observe from a place of non-attachment but ever you may becarrying in the physical body [Music]just gently witnessing any areas of tension or discomfort and invite yourbreath to nurture these areas take a fewdeep breaths into each area of the body calling for your attention and thengently release them [Music]allow your body to sink for a moment into complete stillness and silence[Music][Music][Music]in the same way now draw your attention to anything arising in the mind nowthere is no need to search for anything simply observe yourself open up to thethoughts that may be pre-existing or as they make

wherever it flows[Music][Music]throughout this meditation the mind may entangle itself in thoughts of the pastor in visions of what might come to be if for when it does simply acknowledgethis tendency

it is airyand then chanted somehow beckoning you closer you take a few steps towards thismist very slowly and mindfully and asyou approach it begins to dissipate as it slowly clears you begin to see thereis a bridge ahead of you covered in moss and vines you make your way towards itmindfully treading on the pressed earth beneath your feet and as you cross overeverything you ever knew begins to disappear all thought all attachmentsall fears and all worriesyou are entering into a new world into a different time with every step you takeyou inch closer towards the space and time just on the other side of thebridge it is a place that feels familiarsomehow but one that your conscious mind cannot put any memory to the mist continues toclear and you realize you are within a dense majestic forest you feel at homeyou feel at peace herehe reached the other side of the bridge and with the mist having vanished completely now you take a closer look atthe scenery around you notice the colors and textures of this vibrant forestconsider the way the earth feels beneath your feetyou heighten your awareness of the aroma that awakens as you inhale deeply allowthis place to nurture the deep sense of peace that is within you you walkforward ever so slightly as you noticed something peeking through from withinthe trees and as you approach yourealize there is a cabin hidden within these woods and somehow you sense thatit is or was your own you instantlyremember it perhaps becoming flooded with visions of what it was once like inyour own time you reach the front door and entertake a few moments to witness the visuals that are arising what does thecabin look like what happened here once upon a time whois with you imagery may come slowly and subtlysimply allow them to arise in their own time allow your imagination andintuition to expand quite effortlesslymindfully consider what was once here that no longer remains[Music]youyouremain open to whatever arises there is no need

than the character atcenter stage [Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]continue to breathe deeply as you simply observe whatever is present withoutjudgment to our condemnation[Music][Music]as we move

is there to be learnedwhat is there to shedallow the mind to remain quiet as yourintuition arises tune in with your heartopening yourself to the possibility of transformation[Music]return to your breath and to the aroma of the woodstake a few more moments to witness whatever once happened at this beautiful cabin in the forest[Music] and slowly in your own time returned tothe bridge slowly

ofvision now begin to visualize you're on a tropical island feet firmly groundedinto the warm crystals of sand that stretch out to either side of you whereyou rest the waters are shallow off the coast lending themselves to crystalclear turquoise hues and the most beautiful waters you have ever laid eyesonthe salty breeze infiltrates your nostrils and you exhale deeply feelingyourself sink further into this paradise island that warms both body and soulyou take a few steps forward slowly eventually coming to dip your toes inthe warm yet refreshing waters that surround this small Paradise Islandstanding at a balance point between ocean and earth ankle deep in thoseturquoise waters inner peace flows through you as you come to realize youare whole and complete just as you areyou yearn to dive into the healing salty waters before you and so prepareyourself for this descent when you areready you begin to walk slowly and mindfully away from the steady Shorestep by step until soon your lower legs are submerged you continue walkingslowly and with grace until soon you arewaist-deep in these cleansing waters youpause here tracing the surface of the ocean with your fingertips and when youare ready you reach your arms ahead of you as you shallow dive into the crystalclarity that now bathes your entire bodyas each crystal bead of ocean rushes along your skin you feel restored

thoughts oremotions that arise do not belong to you there are simply bodies of energy cominglike waves before dissolving back into the wholeness of the ocean[Music]Aya's transfixed with the sky you notice the lighting and shade overhead isshifting blue hues now blend into a subtle orange signifying that the Sun isnow setting behind the horizon you takethis as a cue to return to land turning back towards the beach and the canopy ofpalm trees that overhang ityou return to your feet gliding out of the water slowly step by stepyou finally come to reach land and find that a plush towel neatly folded on thewarm sand has been sent for you by the universe you wrap yourself in this warmsoothing towel and begin to walk slowly down the beach into the sunsetas you walk you open your senses to this environmentyou notice the aroma of the salty air continually cleansing you with eachbreathyou taste the salt on the outer edges of your lips left behind from your healingdip in the oceanyou hear the gentle rustling of palm trees a subtle lapping of water againstthe shore and the sound of release that comes with each deep exhale you maketuning into your sense of touch you feel the warmth and comfort of the towelagainst your skin as well as the sweetness of sand beneath your feetstaring ahead you see the crest of beautiful palm trees the white sandslowly becoming darker as night approaches

bungalow connected to the shore by a long wooden dock thisis your own private Cabana where you will sleep the night away in tranquillity step-by-step continuing tomove slowly and mindfully you make your way back to the dock you arrive at thefoot of it and see that string lights lie in both railingsas you make your way towards your private bungalow by ferry light you feelthe day behind you

designed to promote peace of mind for returned soldiers experiencingpost-traumatic stress upon returning home before we move into this visualjourney I would like to acknowledge that this recording is not a replacement forprofessional support but rather it is a tool that can help you to explore thepossibility of finding a safe and comfortable place within yourself it isan anchor into the present moment ofcourse I encourage anyone listening to this to seek the support that they need from professionals and use thismeditation solely as a peaceful way to help you find peace and release duringthose quiet moments before falling asleep so before we begin I invite youto make sure that you are entirely comfortable in the place that you are now in if there's anything that bringsyou extra peace and comfort reach out for these now and this could be assimple as your pillow a sacred object on your bedside table or anything at allthat brings you more comfort so making sure that you're in acomfortable lying down position and take a few full settling breaths here as youground yourself into this spaceat any point during this meditation or at any point throughout the days andnights to come I invite you to remember that your breath is always available asan anchor into the present moment each time we draw our awareness to the breaththe past disappears the future disappears and we are reminded of thestillness that lives in this very moment breath awareness requires nothing butyour attention and can be practiced at any time for just a few seconds or formany so right now follow my voice forthe next short while as you deepen your awareness of this life force that flowsin and out of your body constantly asyou inhale become more observant of your sensory experience as the air flows intoyour nostrils through your windpipe and deep into your lungs[Music]and as you exhale witness the release that occurs as the belly softens thechest falls and your mind just drops awaycontinue to breathe with this heightened awareness paying close attention to thepauses in between each breath cycle soafter each inhalation see if you can notice the complete stillness where thebreath is held for just a brief second and after each exhalation observe thatmomentary stillness after all the air has been released and just in your owntime repeating this observation on your own for a few more breaths cycles[Music][Music]know that wherever you have been whatever lingers from days now behindyou you exist nowhere but in this present moment reality allow the breathand your physical body to remind you of this moving deeply into your physicalpresence anytime the mind wanders into stories or images of the past you arehere you are held by your breath yourbody and spirit right here[Music]while we cannot change what has happened in the past we can continually drawourselves more affirmative ly into today by welcoming ourselves exactly as we areinto the reality of this present moment we find space to honor where we've beenwhile also knowing that we are only ever right here right now this is the onlytime we truly have so in just a momentyou will be guided through a safe and soothing visualization to help you tuneinto more completely to the present moment take a few more slow and steadybreaths and just after a few cycles let's begin[Music]you[Music]shifting your attention now away from your breath and into the empty spacebehind your closed eyes and this spaceholds infinite potential for freedom and release when we adorn it with images ofpeace and light and love so upon thisblank canvas I invite you to witness yourself appearing in a place thatprovides you with a sense of safety and love for you this might be a particularoutdoor landscape or it might be an indoor space it might be a setting fromyour childhood or a place that exists today or it could even be from yourimagination [Music]there are no rules as to what this space looks like so long as it provides youwith the sense that you are safe supported and held exactly as you are[Music]explore this space as you please tuning into any and all of your senses that areappropriate here what does the imageryevoke within youare there any aromas textures or tastesthat bring about a sense of peace and security[Music] what sounds are present in the spacethat surround you if there are no sounds can the silence carry you deeper intostillness and contentment[Music]take a full nourishing inhale and as youexhale just gently release any tension fear or worry letting it go[Music]now I invite you to welcome other beings into this space if it feels comfortablefor you whoever brings you a sense of peace and love is welcome hereperhaps you invite friends to join you family members[Music] professionals you've worked with or petswhile these beings cannot free you of your past they can support you in yourjourney as you move forward if you feelmore at peace in this space alone know that this is entirely okay as well frommoment to moment we require different things sometimes it is the support ofthose who love us sometimes it is our personal connection to our highest selfto nature to universe if the latter istrue for you in this moment invite your higher self the natural world or yourunderstanding of God or the universe into the space within youeven if you have welcomed humans or pets into the visualization already you toomay also invite these deeper connections to support you right now if emotionsarise simply acknowledge them and witness them as passing clouds tuning into how they feel within the body rather than the story that they weave in themind just trust that this beautiful safespace you have created as the capacity to hold you exactly as you are and knowthat there is no weakness in feeling emotion our emotions are a part of whatmakes us human and they are entirely welcome here[Music]continually returned to the peaceful imagery around you and to whatever youhave conjured here that brings you peace [Music]now wherever you have found yourself in this visualization I invite you to takea seat on the earth or on a couch or any other surface that fits your environmentjust getting comfortable you mightconjure up any supportive elements that make you feel at home you might light afew candles in your mind's eye or surround yourself with any other sacredobjects that settle youI invite you to visualize a photo album presenting itself on the floor or asmall table before you inscribed ingolden cursive print on the cover the album reads for safe keeping in the soulthis album has presented itself for you so that you may have a safe space toplace any recurring images or dreams about the past whatever you havewitnessed and experienced cannot be taken away from you however the past canbe laid gently to rest tucked away in a safe corner of the soul to inspire thenext stage of your life's purposetake the album in your hands breathingdeeply as you hold it in quiet reverence[Music] if any challenging thoughts or imagesarise in your consciousness turn these into photographs and tuck them gentlyinto your albumlaying the past down this way in help to honor where you've been while creatingspace for lighter imagery and experiences to take root this is not adenial of where you have been but it may serve as a reminder that these imagesare snapshots of the past and now youhave a brighter lighter future to look forward to [Music][Music][Music]take a few more silent moments to respectfully tuck away any oldphotographs that no longer need to take up space in the forefront of your mindif the imagery does not arise naturally or if it is too painful for you toprocess in this way at this time tune into the natural rhythm of your breathas you quietly repeat the words right here right now I am safe right hereright now I am safeyouI invite you to close the photo album now knowing that you can come back to itat any time you need to store

inner tranquility before you naturally fallinto a deep and restorative sleepshort while you'll be guided to relax the body and ease the mind before beingled through a visual journey into a mystical cave of peace it's your time toallow yourself to be carried away gently through this journey knowing that youare entirely supported in this present moment so take a moment now to ensurethat all end of day activities have been wrapped up alarms should be set andliens drawn I invite you now to comeinto a comfortable lying down position ensuring that your body is resting withease wherever you are you might want to use blankets or cushions to support youas you find comfort in the physical space you occupy [Music]take a few releasing breaths here allowing a deep sigh to leave your bodyon your next outward breath [Music]to begin our journey into tranquility take a moment to observe the stillnessof your physical body as dei transformsinto night and the Sun fades away we are invited to enter a much needed period ofrest and rejuvenation as we sink into the stillness of night rest assuredthere is nothing we need to consciously engage in or take care of we can trustthat the body will work by its way of its innate wisdom so take a moment nowto quietly observe the miracle of this body[Music] feel into its heaviness as you sinkfurther into the surface beneath youyou might want to notice now where there might still be movement despite thesense of stillness notice where breath brings subtlemovement to the body how it causes the chest and stomach to expand on eachinhalation and to fall away on eachexhalation [Music]observe how beautifully this gentle movement intertwines with a deeper senseof complete stillness as you take a few deep breaths here in silence[Music]if thoughts arise in the mind no that is entirely natural for them to do so asyou become aware that your attention has shifted into stories about the past orfuture simply acknowledge these thoughts from a more distant place than his habitor [Music]while the mind can be useful at times it can lure us into a unproductive thoughtcycles when left to run on its own termsas we begin to witness our mental movements from a higher or broadervantage point we practice our power of discernment easing challenging thoughtsand emotions as we experience greater clarity and a sense of peace[Music]as you journey through this meditation keep this sense of distance in mind asthought arises and returned to your breath as an anchor when needed[Music]move now further into breath awareness as you practice holding your attentionon this anchor that is always available to you [Music]notice the breaths wither its pace andits depth as you move alongside it in both directions[Music] hold for a brief pause just a second ortwo and at the end of each inhalation and each exhalation finding briefmoments of complete stillness within each breath cycle[Music]allow the mind to gently subside as you become more attuned to the presentmoment attachment to worried anxious ordistracting thoughts can be released as you practice being the observer ofwhatever is moving through you justallow yourself to sink further and further

sandybeachthe sand is shimmering under the gentle but warm rays of an early Sun there is asubtle breeze that's teasing your hair and soft against your skin the sky is abeautiful blue cloudless and stretches forever sinking only onto a distanthorizon where the sea and the sky unite in a matching Azur color you feelrelaxed free and look around you take inthe most beautiful picture postcard scene you were sitting in a shelteredCove with glorious cliffs reaching up into the sky providing a secure backdropto this perfect scene the rocky cliffsglimmer gray and red with the warming intensity of the Sun and you catchglimpses of white feathers as seabird soar and dive circling on risingthermals distant bird songs filterthrough the air and the piercing cause of seagulls swooping high and low overthe gentle waves brings back childhood memories of seaside escapadesa light breeze whips across the sandycove and the Sun burns even brighter in the sky you stand up and walk along thecoastline dealing the warm sand on the soles of your feet and through your toesfrothy waves wash up onto the beach and in the distance white sailing boatsdrift by the feeling is one of peace asyou walk along the golden sands you see up ahead what seems like a gentlehomeless man with a small dog walking on the edge of the lapping waters he'slooking up to the sky muttering to himself and calling out to the seagullsclothed in tattered pants and a white baggy shirt with an overgrown beardcarrying two bags of what looks like clothes and blankets he approaches youin turns and speaks directly to you your treasure chest is near in a deep cavernhis voice trails off as he passes you however a breeze picks up and you hearhis final words riches beyond belief youturn to see him once more however as you do this he and his dog are nowhere to beseenyou sit for a moment on the sandy beach to collect your thoughts wondering whatthat was all about his words echo inside your head your treasure chest is nearriches beyond belief getting up from thesand you are drawn to a cliff face opposite the beach that appears to havea cave carved within it out of curiosityyou begin to move towards it clambering carefully over small rocks strewn outinto their ever reaching tides you wander through small rock pools feelingthe coolness of the water on your feet the beach cave looks welcoming and asyou approach the rocks have been smoothed as if by hand and you reach outand trail your fingers against the entrance to the cavern walls there is acoolness in places and in others the rocks are warm to the touch where theSun touches themas you take in the scene in front of you and move forward you see dappling light around the wallsof the cave mesmerizing welcoming and intriguing the temperature within theentrance dips immediately but it isn't cold it feels nice to be out of thesunlight for a while marvel at the contours of the beach cave in front ofyou pockets of stone walkways smooth wallswith a contrast of light and dark as small gaps in the rock face allow theSun to penetrate the darkened depths thebeach cave has a strange almost spiritual feel to it peaceful andtranquil and yet it feels as if it has had a purpose not simply carved by theelements but by loving hands smoothing the stone into submission the sound ofwater can be heard echoing from deeper into the cave although the tide isgently lapping along the rocks leading to the cave entrance inside the lowrocks are dry so no danger from an encroaching tide the temperature changesas you move deeper into the labyrinth of cavernous rooms a carved archway liesahead of you and the cave room within flickers and sparkles with flecks ofgreen as you move into the deeper part of the cavern you hear the words oncemore vibrating throughout the cave your treasure is near in a cavern riches beyond beliefyou're drawn to move forward and enter a space so soothing and peaceful that youfeel any remaining tension dissipate to your right deeper within the cave yousee what looks to be a dusty old ornate chest moving to this large old cratecurious to see what this is you blow the dust and sand away it reveals to youwhat looks to be an ancient old treasure chest could this be the treasure chest thehomeless man on the beach was referring to treasure nearby you sit in front ofit get comfortable and loosen the already unlocked latches the chest opensit glistens with gold you see that is divided into three sections they'remarked past present and future and ineach section a small tin boxes [Music]you glanced into the

a ruby encrusted tin that has beenmarked with the word presentexcited to open this you peel back the old tin lid to reveal a piece of paperthat says meditate on three things you are grateful for today

harnesspositive energy achieve deep relaxation and sink into inner peace my name is jasonstevenson and during this evening session i will guide you to mindfully ease bothmind and body before we journey deep into a healing salt cavethere is nothing you need to know for this practice and nothing you need to actively achievesimply let the words offered here guide you back into your innatesense of balance wholeness and presenceto begin tonight's meditation just take a moment to ensure that you are as comfortable as you can besupported by any cushions or pillows that you have available whether on your side or on your backensure that your spine is long and your neck is aligned with your spineyou may close your eyes now if you haven't already done so and then just take a few moments to letyour mind catch up to the present moment paying attention to what it feels liketo be right here right nowyou might notice the felt sensation of the mattress beneath you or the blankets that cover youor you might open your awareness to the sounds that filter through your earsalternatively you might arrive mentally in this present moment by noticing whatit feels like to breathe observing the subtle expansion and contraction that occurs with each breathwhatever sensations help you to arrive in the present moment just spend a few moments noticing themwithout judgmentnotice if the mind wants to label your experience as good or badright or wrong and then simply let those labels go as you breathe outcoming back to the very simple practice of justnoticing [Music]and now take a moment to notice your physical body beginning by drawing your attention tothe top of your head from here gently start to scan your bodydownwards noticing if there are any areas of tension that you might be able to softenor releasejust simply let any physical tension start to dissolve into the surface beneath youas if it were melting awayas we move through this practice you will likely notice that from time to timenegative thoughts worries or other unhelpful ideas and images mightrise to your awareness these fearful or negative thought patterns arethe very things that stand in the way of our experiencing deep peacepositivity and relaxation now what typically happens when negativeor worried thoughts arise is one of two things first we might findourselves becoming completely swept up by these mental storieswhen we are not mindful of these thought patterns they can weigh heavily on our sense ofwell-being and then a second type of relationshipwe might have with these thoughts is one of avoidance and suppressionavoidance and suppression however are not long-term solutions to troublesome or racing thoughtsif what we are after is deep peace positivity and contentment we must firstcultivate a more nourishing balanced relationship with our thoughtsand from here we can explore the possibility of welcoming positive energy and ideas into ourconsciousness so as thoughts arise during thismeditation i invite you to witness these occurrences as if you were anoutside observer of them rather than being caught up in the stream itselfconsider that you are standing at the side of the riverbank watching mental objects comeand watching them gopractice this for a few moments on your own now before we move deeper into our salt cave visualizationto cultivate positive energy and a deep sense of peace simply observeany thoughts that arise with care and maintaining a subtle gap betweenthem and yourselfif certain thoughts seem to have a heavy pull you might alternatively guide thesethoughts down to the center of your heart to be released focusing your attentionon this loving center in your chestnow to cleanse yourself more completely before we step into our visualizationi invite you to take three long deep breaths and releasing with a soft sigh throughthe mouth on each exhalationafter that final exhalation let your breath return to its natural rhythmand your attention

be supportive of deep sleep when the time comesjust allow your spine to lengthen and your limbs to softenas you feel into how gravity is holding you here right nowclosing your eyes whenever you feel readyand take a moment to check in with your physical bodyjust inquire with your body about whether you might need anything else in this moment perhaps apillow a blanket a pair of socks or any otheradjustmentand when you're ready find a comfortable position of relative stillness you don't need to aimfor complete stillness as your body is always in subtle motion anywaysbut see if you can surrender as much as you can into non-doingknowing that you are always free to make adjustments as you need to throughout the practiceand turn your attention towards the breath for a few moments now just minding its natural rhythmas it moves through your bodyand for the next few breath cycles refrain from changing the breath in anyway simply allow it to flow naturallywhile also considering the fact that each full breath cleanses and nourishes and supports youeach breath in restores your blood of the oxygen it requiresand each breath out emits what no longer serve youand now i invite you to take three deep breaths at your own pace beginning whenever you areready and inhaling to the furthest depth that is stillcomfortable for you and then exhale maybe releasing a softsigh or anything else that yearns to be let go ofinhale completelyand exhale what you no longer needafter your third deep breath just continue to breathe naturallyand then take a moment to re-ground into the surface supporting youand just take note of each part of your body that is in contact with your bedand noting the sensation of fabric against your skinand before we move into the forest inside your mind just take a moment to offer a word ofgratitude for the place that holds you right nowmake a note of any aspects of your environment that you can be thankful for in this very momentand when you're finished

and resiliencethe sun's rays continue to hold you as you tune into other elements of the forest nowfirst you notice the sweet aroma that fills your nostrils as you breatheyou absorb the aliveness of the forest with each full breaththen your eyes trace the lengths of those remarkable treeswhich are firmly rooted calm and stableyou admire the base of the trees and the intricate pattern of their barkand then your gaze rises up them noticing the complexity of branches thatextend out from the solid stable corethe leaves on those upper branches are diverse and varied even from down below you cansee that some are round some are triangular and someare irregular like the leaves of the chestnut trees and the maplesjust together they dance seamlessly in the soft breezeoccasionally you witness a leaf splitting from its branchand dancing down towards the earth you admire how effortlessly it lets gohow naturally it surrendersas you gaze up at the leaves you realize how transient they are seasons come and seasons goand throughout the seasons the trees shed their leaves in order to be renewedand so you liken the leaves above you to the thoughts that come and go for seasons in your mindanxious or worried thoughts are just as transient as those delicate leaves that shimmer inthe windand so as you rest here beneath the canopy paireach falling leaf with an anxious ruminating or worried thought that you would like to releaseor softenas one of these thoughts come to mind see it falling towards the rich andfertile earth as a delicate leaf does at the end of its seasonas each leaf of anxiety or worry falls towards the earth somethingremarkable happens time appears to speed up in your mind'seye as you watch each fallen leaf transmute from vibrant greento deep red to dark rust and quickly as if you were watchingtime-lapsed film you observe each leaf decay becoming one with thebed of soil it rests oncontinue to watch this miraculous process of transformation on your ownlink each anxious thought with a falling leaf and as it arrives on the earth watch asalchemy takes over what begins as a worried delicate leaffluttering in the wind of life is capable of transformingof becoming rich dense soil through the ever-present possibility oftransformationremember that your body is a tool to facilitate releasewith each thought that surrenders to the earth allow the body to surrender as wellby relaxing your body you encourage the mind to do the sameany and all sorts of anxious thoughts can be processed in this wayso long as the cause of your concern does not require urgent action in this momentit's possible to tap into a sense of surrenderand to let go of anxious thoughts does not mean we don't care aboutcertain outcomes or that we are in denial of how we feelrather it's a simple recognition that the past cannot be returned tothat the future is undetermined and that all we have is the presentmoment and in this present moment we can choose to open ourselves upto deeper peaceyou continue to rest on the forest floor bundled up as the sun moves behind thecanopy now the air is still warm and soyou are completely comfortabletake a few more moments of silence to watch leaves of anxious thoughts falltowards the earth watch them quickly and effortlesslyturn into dried leaves and then into soil itselfyour eyes are growing tired but you continue to absorb the tranquility ofthe world around you here amongst the plantsinsects and trees you realize that anxiety is not a concernthe various beings that call this forest home simply go about their livesthey know what needs to be done and they do itand the rest they leavean awareness grows within you that nature doesn't need to worryyes there are times when it must leap into action to protect itselfbut it doesn't over ruminate it doesn'toverthink this recognition alone helps you to breathe deeper helps you to further surrenderyou come back to your breathing feeling the natural rhythm of this cyclemoving through you just like the seasons the breath comesand it goes it comesand it goesyou feel yourself surrendering deeper to this universal wisdom of the breathyou realize that there is indeed an innate universal force that is holding youand supporting you you realize now that you do not need todo nor do you accomplish everything on your ownand so if you'd like to i invite you nowto ask the universal energy all around you for any support that you need for afinal releasein other words is there something that you are still struggling to let go ofsomething that you need support withand if so turn towards the sky that seeps through the canopy overheadand ask for its wisdom for its supportif you hear a wise voice offer its support to youknow that not only does it come from the universe around youit comes simultaneously from inside your very own beingyou are the holder of the wisdom that you seekfor a few more silent moments come back to the falling leaveslet any thoughts that do not serve you be surrendered nowallow the universe and your inherent wisdom to support you with thisif it feels natural for you you might even tap into a sense of joy as you observethe falling

1 tf1nsinsicpg1252onttbl0nilcharset0 HelveticaNeue;ieww11520iewh8400iewkind00s22 [Music]hello and welcome to this guided meditation this is the positive miraclesguided sleep meditation I'm Jason Stephenson we're often toldabout the importance and power of being positive but knowing that we should bepositive is one thing but actually being positive is another and when the day'sstresses pile up and things don't work our way it's too easy to give in to ouremotions and feel anything but positive and it makes it harder for us to go tosleep when this continues we sometimes give in to feelings of inadequacy believing thatwe're not good enough or worthy enough and never will be at the very worst wemay begin to suspect that there's a vast conspiracy determined to foil us at every turn and thus cynics are bornthese perpetuate a terrible cycle they believe they're not good enough or thatthings will never work their way they therefore become blind to wonderfulopportunities awaiting them at every corner thus reinforcing their own beliefs and this is the prison ofnegative thinking now this meditation is the antidote to such a prison the aim ofthis meditation is to get you to sleep with miracles of positive and kindintentions so let's beginnow for this one you can prepare as you would go into sleep lying down on your back or you can sit upright with yourspine straight and this allows you to maintain an upright but comfortable position without strain to help youbreathe more easily and maintain a good balance let your shoulders relax andrest your hands palms up on your lap or by your side if you are lying down thisstabilizes you rolls your shoulders back and opens up your rib cagenow facing straight ahead and pretend that you're the CEO of a major companyor the ruler of a powerful country in your hands lies the fate of millions youare a very important person so project your power through your upright andconfident but relaxed postureand because of who and what you are you have earned the right to just be for nowall appointments meetings schedules and deadlines they can all wait but now theymust take a back seat to what you are about to do so keeping your lips closedrelax your jaw so that there's a gap between your teeth and rest the tip ofyour tongue against the back of your upper teeth gently close your eyes soyour work can begin now please payattention to your breathing and notice how it moves in and out of your body andhow your body responds to it and that's breathing now in and out through yournosenotice how your body feels a sense of expansion as you breathe in and how yourbody contracts as you exhalebring your focus now to your stomach and as you breathe in bring the breath hereso that it bloats with each inhalation and as you exhale feel your stomachcontractyou[Music]so in a few more moments I'm going to direct your breath by asking you to inhale and to exhale to a slow count ofthree ready inhale one one-thousand twoone-thousand three one-thousand exhale one one-thousand two one-thousand threeone-thousand inhale 1 2 3 exhale 1 2 3inhaleexhale now trying to keep this pattern ofslower breathing for the remainder of this meditation just slowing it downnaturally you don't have to mentally count each breath but just seeing if you can keep it nice and slow and steadymaintain your focus on breathing into your stomach so it expands with eachin-breath and contracts with each out breath you can visualize that yourstomach is a balloon that grows and shrinks with each inhalation andexhalationyouyou still maintaining the pace of yourbreath think back to an incident where you put a smile on someone's face nowyou don't have to remember their names all that matters is that you made someone happy and that you did it withno thought of getting something back itdoesn't have to be something major it could be something as simple as holding the door open for someone or giving achild a piece of candy or offering someone a sincere compliment that madetheir daynow if several incidents come to mind pick the one where the recipient of yourkindness expressed a genuine gratitude can you remember what they said or whatthey did just dwell in that memory for afew moments and try to recall as much detail as you can[Music] do you remember how you felt in thatmoment did the other person's reactionsurprised you maybe it made you feel goodmaintain your even breathing but just keep that memory and enjoy the feelingI'd like you now to remember a time when someone did you a kind Actpreferably one that you so badly needed but never expectednow again you don't have to know the person's name or even remember the details of their face just try to recallas much of the incident as you can didit happen at night or during the day what happened just before the person orpersons came along did you ask for help or did they just volunteer to help whatdid they do to help youdo you remember how you felt in that moment did you feel surprised gratefuldid you express your gratitude if so howdid it make you feel valued noticed no longer invisible that there are indeedgood people in the world just take a moment to explore that memory and torelive what you feltstill maintaining the slow even pace of your breath I'd like you to consider thefollowing thought the gratitude you've felt toward another was the samegratitude that another felt toward you it might be a feeling of lightness andpeace one where the world seemed right even if only for a moment but the personto whom you were kind they too felt what you are now feeling that the worldseemed right because they were good and kind people in it people like you nomatter what your situation is like no matter the state of your finances orrelationships no matter the state of your health or the demands on your timeand attention this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you if youbut hold on to it no matter how much orhow little you have no matter your state of mind or how you feel this power to begood and kind can never be taken from you if you hold on to it no matter whatyour country's social political or economic situation is like and how itaffects you this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you youhold on to it by understanding that this is your innate nature that's why itfeels so good because it's your default State this is how you came into theworld and how you may have spent the first years of your life until you grew older and forgot your true natureyou are not your gender nor your sexuality nor your job nor your economic status nor your nationality or politicalaffiliation you are yourself a being filled with love with light with peaceand joy you are a person who seekshappiness and miracles and wants it for others as well because you know thatthis is the default State for everyone your pain is the result of knowing thistruth but seeing another that's why youcome alive when someone shows you kindness because it reminds you of theirinnate nature and that's why you feel powerful and validated when you showkindness to another because it is a reminder of your own innate nature youmay not be the CEO of a major company or the ruler of a powerful country but youhave a power similar to theirs the power to change the lives of others and itbegins with one thought that I am good and therefore have the power todemonstrate the goodness or to withhold it it begins with one act the power tosit or stand up straight and undefeated confident in understanding of your owninnate goodness finally it projects itself with onesimple but sincere smile one that makes you feel good and because you feel goodyou pass that feeling on to another changing another's day for the better bymaking them feel the same and when another person feels good theypass on that feeling on to another who passes it on to another and so oncontinuing a chain reaction that began with you so you do have a tremendouspower one that could potentially affect millions and indeed change the world forthe better knowing this you cannot possibly be ashelpless or as powerless as you have let yourself believe understanding this youcan live each day with an upright posture a kind smile upon your face andcreating miracles there are millions out there whose dahi depends on you andbecause their day depends on you so do their lives and the lives of others letgo of your limitations and accept your own power and responsibility to shapethe world into a better and more positive place it first begins with yourest well my friend rest well and go outcreate miracles change your life and at the same time changing the lives ofothers

bodyas you watch your breath know that there is nothing it needs to do in noparticular way it needs to flow our breath contains a wisdom that knowsjust how to support and nourish us all that is

travel through the body softening each part that our awarenessmoves through begin now by drawing your attention tothe crown of your head holding your awareness there for a fewmoments [Music]imagine this uppermost part of your body softening and a process that trickles down slowlyto ease your foreheadyour eyebrowsand your templeslet your entire top half of your head relax releasing all physical and mentaltension it might be holdingand then slowly let this softening seep into your cheekbones and your jawyour mouth and your tongueas your awareness gently descends further it brings softness to your neck and yourshoulders helping them to release any weight they may have carried throughout the dayand then envision that softening trickling down your arms relaxing each and every cellall the way to your fingertipsreturning your attention to your heart space now allow your chest to relax and your upperback as welland then slowly scan the length of your spine downwards inviting all tissues and muscles thatsurround it to surrender deeper into this night[Music]your attention centers itself in the belly now and let all muscles around your corerelax as the belly rises and falls with eachbreathand then allow your awareness to soften the hips the pelvis and the buttocksbefore gently trickling down the legs softening each muscle completely until arriving atthe tips of your toes[Music]hold your entire body in your awareness letting it surrender completely into thesurface beneath youyou might notice a heaviness within your body as well as a lightness the sense thatyour body has given up completely to the weight of gravity while at thesame time feeling entirely free and weightlesslet yourself revel in that sensation for a few breaths nowthe feeling of being held by gravity while also freely floating within theairy cosmic universe[Music][Music]in just a moment we will begin a journey into the starsfloating gracefully away from the earth yet before we do solet's take a moment to realize where we are truly headed and that is into a deep and restorativeslumber so before we begin our ascension into the cosmostake a moment to silently repeat i let golet goi let gosurrendering completely to the weightlessness of [Music]sleepin your mind's eye as your body and mind become lighter i invite you to envisionthat you are resting in an open meadow beneath the starry skya soft blanket of grass rests beneath you your body is kept warm amidst the summerairthe breeze whistles in the leaves of nearby trees rustling through tall grasses as wellthe night sky is onyx black reflecting darkness into your eyes butfor the dazzling stars and crescent moon above you [Music]the world is quiet around and within youyou inhale the evening air filling yourself up with the airy cosmosyou are a part ofeach breath in brings a lightness to your body [Music]and each breath out helps you to let go to surrender to the sky aboveand around youas your body gets lighter you notice the earth beneath you drifting awaysuddenly you are light enough to be untouched by the weight of gravity yourbody rising above the ground and into the night skyyou are not afraid you know you are protected here sosurrender to the process you are in allowing yourself to be carried awayfrom the earth and into the stars[Music]your body floats higher and higher passing through thin veils of cloudthat grace the atmospherethe air around you is quiet as is your mind spaceup here amidst the clouds and beneath the light of the moonnothing of your life on earth seems to matterall that matters is this miraculous open space you drift throughdrifting further away from the earth you take a moment to look down upon itthe entire globe is in full view the atmosphere around it dark andpeaceful and twinkling lights shine back at youas if mimicking the starsno sounds of the earth can be heard from where you are no trafficno wind no moving wateryou are miles away now [Music]your entire body floats higher still and as it does the stars becomelarger and brighter [Music] your eyes land on one star in particularand everything else seems to melt awayyou spend some time with this star whispering your intentions for thecoming day and inviting it to support you in surrendering to the nightyour breath is still soft nourishing you as you float high above the earthyou take one last moment to commune with your favorite star before letting your attention widen toall the other celestial bodies that find their home within the skyplanets comets and shooting stars all come into view as you gaze into theabyss of the cosmos still you know you are heldsafe by the universe here you are calm peacefuland entirely at ease [Music]you consider all the constellations that are spread out before youindeed they look different from this higher vantage point their patterns not so easilyobserved this close up and yet you reflect upon some of yourfavorites orion libracapricorn and aquariusnow that you are here in the realm of all the constellations [Music]you understand why ancient traditions and cultures have long held up these celestialformations the closer you get to them the moreremarkable they come the more they enchant your mind heartand soulcome back to your breath with full awareness now inhaling and exhaling deeplyyour body remains light and free as you drift through the cosmosreveling at the starsnow like a feather gliding through the air slowly and steadilyyou feel your body slowly coming back downsome magic mysterious force holds you supporting you as you movegracefully away from the realm of planets stars and the moonyou do not return to the earth just yet though with grace you land gentlyupon a plush supportive cloudyou release a deep sigh as you sink into this cosmic cushion letting it support youfrom head to toeas you rest here you find stillness [Music]you gaze up at the mystery of the atmosphere above you eyes landing on the silver of the moonthat is transitioning through its waning facein a few nights from now it will become a dark and dazzling new moonand yet for now it is waningslowly growing smaller at a rate too slow for the human eye to catch in asingle moment you consider the energy of the waningmoon remembering that this particular lunar transitionis a time for releasing slowing down surrendering andrestoring now is the time to sink into non-doingto let yourself be exactly as you areperched on a cloud you take three full breaths each inhalelasting to a count of four and each exhale being a little bit longerlasting to a count of six inhaling forfour and exhaling for six[Music] you finish one more breath this wayallowing your exhale to cleanse you of any residual tension or weight you may beunconsciously holdingallow your breath to return to its natural rhythmyour body is relaxed your mind is relaxedand you are ready to completely surrenderyou take one more moment to gaze up at the night sky from this heightyou thank

Iwill be taking you on this journey though this meditation was originallyused in Buddhism you don't have to be a Buddhist to make it work for you nor doyou have to subscribe to any religion or belief in Supernatural love and kindnessare wonderful things but often we feel anything but sometimes it's easier tofeel anger and hate but author Jonathan Lockwood who he alsoknown as the philosopher of happiness put it best when he said forgive othersnot because they deserve your forgiveness but because you deserve peace now unfortunately that's ofteneasier said than done but fortunately this meditation can help you so let'sbegin so please sitting upright but comfortably so if you'd like to restyour back against something that's fine just don't slouch or lean back because doing so will affect your breathing andif you want to lie down and do this before you drift off to sleep that's okay to just rest your hands palms faceup on your lap or or by your side if you're lying down now close your eyesand focus on your breathing it's alright if thoughts and images come in so longas you keep most of your attention on your breath you're doing fine when you see a thoughtallow it to be don't try and push it down but you simply shift your focusback to your breathing I want you to remember a time when youdid a kind thing for someone it doesn't have to be dramatic but I have twoconditions the first is that you did it without a thought of a reward or aninfluence to that person and the second is that you didn't later regret what youdid just reflecting on that do you remember how it felt did it feel gooddid you feel proud of yourself did it bring a smile to your face[Music]if you're smiling now that's all good that feeling stems from a core goodnesswithin yourself now I want you to try to remember what you looked like as a childthe younger the better that child youwere for all their faults and mischievousness deserved patience andunderstanding that child you were also deserved loved could you see yourselfwanting to protect and provide for that child[Music]could you see yourself wanting to hold and comfort that child just explore thisthought for a moment[Music]you younow if you can just mentally repeat after me for all the ways that I harmmyself negate doubt belittle myselfjudge or be unkind to myself through myown confusions I forgive myself

you so much[Music][Music] could you see yourself hating this imaginary child if this child were hurtor upset could you see yourself wanting to pick them upperhaps hugging them to give them some comfort if you saw this child alone andscared could you see yourself walking away [Music][Music]what could you see yourself putting aside your own feelings to comfort someone in the midst of their own painand suffering [Music]now imagine this person as they are now if you saw them alone and scaredfar away from wherever it is you have to interact with them if you saw themvulnerable suffering and in pain and know that this is that same child youwould have comforted could you still dislike or hate them with the sameintensity or could you see yourself softening a little[Music]if you could see this

become more and more aware of thepresent momentvery moment you simply are you areperfect you are whole just take a momentnow to observe the natural flow of yourbreathingyounotice how with each breath in yourchestizes and with each breath out it fallsup and downjust like the steadily swinging pendulumof lifeyoubring your attention to this precisemomentto struggle or to force yourself to dothis by simply coming back to yourbreath you will return to the moment andbecome aware of it just breathe in andthen breathe outfrom the start of a new day right up tothe end we are exposed to thousands ofthoughts don't try to fight yourthoughts simply observe them witnessthem and then coming back to your breathslowly let those thoughts goremember breathe in and breathe outyou may find yourself thinking about aparticular event or events that havepassedslowing down the thought processdrift among those memories witness themfrom above and recognize themtell yourself I'm thinking about thisevent I acknowledge itand as you breathe out move along withthe breath detaching yourself a littlemore from that particular thoughtwe must understand that we cannot changethe past that we can learn somethingfrom itupon a lesson you might have learnedfrom that event or those eventsagain to not strain yourself to think ofthe lesson simply breathe in and breatheout againand if something comes to mind take itwith you if not remain with the breathand you can always return for furtherreflection at another timebreathe inand as you breathe out let the past flowthrough your system and out to becomeone with the universesometimes we are overpowered by a senseof anger or grief and that in turn holdsus back if this is the case view now ifany of these thoughts arise just breatheinfocusing on that breathing breathingafresh energy and on your breath outbecoming fully aware of your breathin this state of relaxation your mind isoperating at a slower more passivefrequencyyou are hence able to observe thesefeelings of anger or grief withoutletting it affect youa moment now to reflect upon this didnot try too hard to determine the sourceof it simply acknowledge its presenceand then return to the breaththere are opportunities to become angryand upset every now and again howeverit's important to remember that we havea choice of whether or not to feed theseemotions and by merely coming back

1 tf1nsinsicpg1252onttbl0nilcharset0 HelveticaNeue;ieww11520iewh8400iewkind00s22 my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this guided meditationthat will help you to wisely let go of any anger you might beexperiencing before sleep when held onto anger can inhibit us from feeling intoour innate sense of peace and our capacity for compassionand so by becoming mindful of this emotion and addressing it thoughtfully we canloosen its grip and uncover a new way forwardso to begin this bedtime meditation take your time to get settled in for the night ensure that your spine islong and straight and your neck becoming an extension of it and thenallow your limbs to relax and fall however they arecomfortable close your eyes as you turn yourattention inwards and then note what it feels like to be held by the surface beneath youwhat does it feel like to be tethered by the weight of gravitywhat does the mattress or other surface beneath you feel like against your skinwithout judging your experience see if you can simply become more intimate withthe physical space you rest inand once you feel grounded and completely connected to the physical world i inviteyou to shift your attention to the air around you you might notice thesensation of it against your cheeks or you might observe the way itslowly enters and exits the body as your breathas each breath fills you you're provided with life-supporting oxygenoffered to us by the plant kingdom and with each breath out we return thisgift to the plant life in the form of carbondioxide spend a few moments with your breath now noting howeffortless this exchange this flow issee if you can allow the chest the shouldersand the belly to soften facilitating the flow of the breath and perhaps inviting ita little bit deepernow as we dive into this process of releasing the energy of angerit is worthwhile to begin by softening out judgments of this emotionin and of itself anger is neither good nor bad it is simply a reactionwe experience to various circumstances or events in our life what we dowith our anger is another thing when left to fest inside or whenreleased mindlessly upon those around us anger can hurt more than it healshowever we can also choose to use anger as a signpost for what we valuefor the direction we wish to move in our livesonly when we begin by softening our judgment and opening to this experience withmore care and curiosity do we enable ourselves to discover a newway forward so right now i invite you to take amoment to draw your attention to your heart space the center of your chestand as you breathe envision the heart expanding energetically with eachbreath in and softening its toughest barriers witheach breath outwith each breath that moves through the heart imagine your judgments of this emotionrelaxing as you create more space for it to unravel in a healing and a cleansing wayif stories about rightness or wrongness come to mindsimply note these as they appear and then release with an out breath for example if wenotice ourselves feeling righteous or holding on to the wrong doings of another we might invitethese to soften if only just for a momentand this does not mean you'll not be called to take certain wise action in daily lifebut for now harboring the energy of this anger is likely of little benefitso continue to come back to the breath again and again as needed expanding as youinhale and softening or releasing as you exhalebefore we move into the visualization that will help us to cleanse any held anger for the coming nighti invite you to mindfully inquire into the energy that lives beneath your angerthe energy that this anger arises fromsometimes our anger comes from the mind as a yearning to be rightor as a defensive reaction other times it arises from our valuesfrom care and concern about someone or somethingand even sometimes it's a mix of these two things a blend of mental and intuitiveresponses to the world around us so i invite you to take a few moments tocompassionately curiously and non-judgmentally inquire into the energies beneathor behind the raw experience of anger and just hold yourself gently as youexplore this noting to what extent you might be reacting in defenseand to what extent this emotion may be rising out of lovewhen you awaken into another day you can use this self-knowledge to help younavigate your anger in a way that is conducive of deep healingon an individual and collective level but for now let's take some time to justlet it all go to reaffirm that in this momentwe are well that in this moment we can best serve ourselves by invitingour anger to dissolve so take a moment now to come back toyour breath for a few cyclesuse the breath or the body as an anchor for your attention any time you find your mind wanderingthat does not serve you in this moment just bring it back focusing back on your breathingand once you feel centered i invite you to bring your attention to the creative capacity of your mindand in this space begin to visualize that you are in the midst of an autumnforest surrounded by trees with leaves turning ambermahogany gold and crimsonthe forest floor beneath your feet is a path of densely packed earth a thin layer ofearly autumn leaves lays sparse signifying that the turn of seasons isupon youthe air is cool but you are dressed warmly for the eveningthe sky is still a pale blue but you can tell by the glimmer in thetrees that the sun will be setting soonbefore making your way along the path that leads you through the woodsyou take a moment to plant your feet into the earthreaching the top of your head towards the sky above your heart opens your shoulders relaxyou take a few long slow deep breaths to ground yourselfinto this calm and soothing forestyou allow your forehead to soften your jaw to unclenchyour belly to relax and all unnecessary tension to softenand following your next breath out you decide to move forwardto venture deeper into the transitioning woods you have arrived instep by step you move along the pathway that guides you through the colorfulenchanting landscape the air is crisp and earthycleansing you with each breath that moves through yousmall forest critters scurry across the earth and and birds chirp from their cozy nestssnuggled in the trees as you admire the harmony of life herein the woods you feel yourself surrendering to itopening up to this moment exactly as it isany weight you've been carrying upon your shoulders begins to lightenguided by the energy of the falling leavesany judgments frustrations concerns or

tranquil space within yourself aswell though the forest is not immune to thechallenges of life but now it embraces the harmonioustransition from day into nightyou carry on just a short while before the forest begins to thinand as it does your jaw drops at the radiant beauty that emergesglimmering back into your eyes a silent still pristine lake surrounded by thevibrant foliage of the forest comes into viewtreading lightly towards the water's edge you find a sandy stretch of shorelineand allow yourself to take a seatfrom where you rest you admire the reflection of the trees and the stillsurface of the lake the perfect mirror image softens yourheart calling you deeper into the mystery of the worldthe reflection reminds you that we are all mirrors to one anotherthat everything we face has something to show us about ourselvesor about the nature of the worldsee if you can feel your mind softening as you reflect upon thissinking into the silence that holds it alland now as you sit here by the lake you hold yourself and the worldin a full embrace without desiring to change anythingabout this simple moment see if you can open yourself completely to whatisthe frustrations the judgments anger that you've experienced as being apart of the world now begin to feel distanthere amidst the autumn trees and silent lake you are granted with the time and spacerequired for you to process all of those inner energiesyou trust that as you process them new possibilities for more wise andloving steps to take in days to come will present themselves to youas you gaze out across the water you realize there is nothing that needsto be done in this moment but to continue allowing yourself to surrenderand so you lean back allowing your full body to nestle intothe sandy shore beneath youfeel yourself fully supported here on this small beach by the lakeas the sun seeps behind the tree linethe orange pink glow of the night radiates throughout the cosmosbringing a warmth to your beingand as you rest here you take a moment to inquire with your bodyabout any areas of tension or residual anger that may be longing for yourattention drawing your awareness to the crown of your head

flower some way offyou hear the contented buzz of a honeybee pleased with an afternoon ofpollen gathering the soil is soft under your bare feet warmed by the Sun aboveyour head fluffy white clouds Scud across a bright blue skyyour heart feels warm filled with gratitude and love for this place eventhough you have just arrived you are safe here and you are happy take it allin[Music][Music][Music][Music]the air is warm and the Sun is gentle on your cheeks you feel loose relaxed letyourself sink down into a reclining position your back cushioned by the lushgreen grass underneath you a butterflyfloats overhead moving on to a nearby flower feel the soil underneath yourback smell the flowers the grass thedirt all around yousee yourself looking upwards watching the clouds move across the sky they tocalm you loving your body into an even deeper tranquilityif you can imagine your body falling asleep in this mirror growing heaviermore relaxed your spirit may not

a little while as your spirit continuesits journey into relaxation your bodywill rest right here entirely safe entirely secure until you are ready toreturn to it no harm will come to you during this meditation with this in mindturn your eyes to the horizon at theedge of the meadow you can see a leafy green band of trees standing Sentinelthe majestic guardians of this sacred space in your heart you know that thereis a tree there's that is taller and larger than the others far more ancientthan those that grow around it you feel inexplicably drawn toward it connectedat a deep and spiritually significant level you begin to walk towards the edgeof this meadow allow yourself to move towards theforest following the path that appears at your feet and leads into the trees as you approachthey grow taller and taller in your vision beginning as the size of yoursmallest finger in the distance but soon towering over your headwith a calm wisdom that permeates your entire being as you step under thecanopy you feel any stress or strain you're carrying begin to loosen fallingaway in the same way dried leaves fall from the boughs of the maple in autumneverything you let go of drifts away disappearing already decomposing intothe soil that will nurture the trees here for years to come[Music] the sunshine here is less bright dappledand soft instead of its usual brash goldthe air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed toand yet it is a soothing coolness filledwith the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss all around you standthe trunks of trees and saplings some tall and smooth others old and knildthere are younger trees too skinny and gangly as they grow towards sunlight letyourself sense the slow determination of these trees anchored by roots as long asthe tree is tall the trees are contentto simply be here calm and strong against the weather they welcome youinto their presence greet you as one just as ancient and wise as they are[Music][Music] as you breathe deeply watching thesunlight meander back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze bring yourattention back to your spiritual self the tree sense that there is somethingyou still carry with you a mental or emotional weight that troubles you evenin this place it is safe to understand it here perhaps you are mourning the endof a relationship or struggling with a relationship that exists now maybe youare tired after a long journey toward a still unreached goalperhaps you worry about money or health either for yourself or for someone elseyou might carry guilt or regret bitterness or perhaps even hatred[Music] whatever appears does not make you evilbut is a sign of yourself outgrowing something that once used to fit there'sno need to judge yourself here but instead calmly regard whatever appearsin your mind and spirit [Music]let whatever this may be surface within you and when you have looked at it fromevery angle imagine as a handful of mudmaterializing in your hands as you lookat it a breeze appears drying it outturning it to dust blowing it away from you into the trees your palms are cleanand no trace remains of this worry or concern in your heart [Music]feel the way the sunlight darts about moving with the fluttering leaves butalso heeling wherever your soul may be hurting first the wind cleansed you ofany emotional pain and now allow the Sun to heal you whatever may be aching[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]you continue your walk down the path hearing the distant chatter of squirrelsand the occasional chirp of birds thepath leads you onwards as you take in the sounds sights and smells of theforest drawing you onward until you reach the oldest tree in the forestthis particular tree has a trunk so large that a cave has been carved outwithin the middle of it a perfect place for quiet reflection and contemplationits bark is smooth with a goldish sheen and far far overhead the leaves dance inthe breeze with an almost silvery tint

it is important for you to set a specific intention orpersonal resolve for the practice so you can commit to it at the start let itsink into your subconscious during and revisit it when the practice is comingto a close this intention is called a San culpa this San culpa can help you make apositive change in your life as your brain enters delta-wave frequencies where you are very receptive to changefor your San culpa choose something that aligns with your deepest desiresthis statement is positive in nature and is in the present tense you may chooseto start the statement using the words I am as you are solidifying your intentionfeel it in your heart as if it is trueperhaps imagine what your life might be like when it is true you can keep thesame San culpa for as long as you like and

We will start in a seated posture, and then move onto a lying posture later on.Please find a comfortable seated position on your bed. It might help to add a pillowunder you for support. ...Rest your hands on your knees, with your palms facing up. Close your eyes.Take a moment to feel your body, and feel the natural flow of your breath....Regardless of what happened in your day, it is time to let it go. Release your day, releaseall the worries, release all the stress. You don't need it anymore.We'll take 5 deep breaths, with an open mouth exhale. When you inhale, think of peace. Whenyou exhale, let go of any tension that you may be holding onto, both in your body andin your mind. With each exhale, find a deeper & deeper level of release.Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling up the space in the bottom of your belly...Then a deep exhale out through your mouth, releasing all the worries and tension fromyour day.Take another deep breath in through your nose, breathing in peace,And a big exhale out through your mouth, exhaling all the stress...Deep inhale through your nose, let the air reach deep into your belly...And a deep exhale out through your mouth, letting go...Another deep inhale through your nose,Exhale and let it all out... feel your body soften & relax...Final deep breathe in... inviting peace...And exhale... drop your shoulders and release...Become aware of how your body feels now. And how your breath grows slower and deeper asyou relax. ....The mind and body are one. When our mind relaxes, our body relaxes, and vice versa. When wefeel stress or anxiety, our bodies hold onto these emotions as physical tension, and itmakes it harder for us to relax and sleep well.Every night, make time to clear your mind and relax your body. This is your time tolove and nurture your mind, body, and soul.Now, we will do some gentle stretches to further relax the body.Let's start with some neck stretches.Take a deep breath in'85 And on your exhale, bring your chin down to stretch the back ofyour neck. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your hands behind your head.Hold here for two full breaths, breathing through the tension with each exhale.On your next exhale bring your chin to neutral and face forward.Onto side neck stretches. Gently tilt your head to the right, and hold for three deepbreaths. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your right hand on your head'85Reset on your 3rd breath.Now do the opposite side. Tilt your head slowly to the left, and hold for three deep breaths....Reset on your next exhale'85Now let's do a couple neck circles on each side.. While inhaling, slowly roll your headto the right, back, then exhale to the left, and then down'85 gently at your own pace,do one more round'85inhaling for the first half, exhaling for the 2nd half.....Now switch directions. Slowly circle your neck the other way, inhaling to the left,back, exhaling to the right, and down. Repeat for one more round'85When you'92re done, take a deep breath and open mouth exhale to reset.Next, do 5 shoulder rolls in each direction. Inhale and bring your shoulders forward andup, then roll them back then down. Repeat this circular motion four more times, deepbreathing throughout....Now roll your shoulders 5 times in the the opposite direction, deep breathing throughoutand loosening up your shoulder muscles. ....Take a deep breath and reset. Notice how your body feels now.Now that you've begun stretching, listen to your body. Where else would you like to stretchand release tension? Follow your intuition and what your body craves....Maybe you want to stretch your legs and reach for your toes. Maybe you want to lay downand do some spinal twists. Whatever it may be, listen to your body and follow what yourbody is telling you..... Remember to deep breathe through each stretch. ....[ 2.5 min ]Whenever you're ready, move into a lying position. We'll start with a slow breathing exercisewith 3 slow breaths.Take a deep breath into your abdomen... hold it there for 3 seconds, and exhale slowly,elongating your exhale as much as you can....Take another deep breathe in through your nose, breathing into your abdomen.... holdit there for 3 seconds... and exhale slowly.One more breath like that, inhale into your abdomen, hold it for 3 seconds.. and thenslowly exhale until you have no more air left.Take a healing breath in, and exhale it out... Feel your breath and heart rate slow down.It is time to completely let go, and allow yourself to just be.We will now relax the entire body, bringing awareness to one area at a time. With eacharea, feel your body melt into the bed'97into total relaxation.Relax your forehead'85 Relax your eyebrows... Relaxyour lips'85 Relax all your facial muscles...Relax your scalp'85 Relax your brain'85Relax your shoulders'85Relax your arms... relax your hands'85 relax your fingertips.Relax your heart'85. Relax your stomach.Relax your hips.. Relax your thighs...Relax your calves'85. Relax your feet.... Relax your toes.Feel your entire body totally relax...Take a slow deep breath in... and a slow deep breath out.... allowing your body to sinkinto your bed, comfortably, peacefully.You are safe. You are safe now.....Allow your mind to drift... into the space between the conscious and subconscious.You are safe. You are safe now.In this space of zero effort, there is nothing more for you to do, but to let go and allowyourself to rest.Rest. Beautiful, nourishing, loving - rest.You deserve it.Sending you so much love and light. Sweet dreams. & Namaste.

with your higher self too often we get so caughtup in our lives that we forget to really live and really living means existingbeyond the confines and demands of schedules immediate wants and needs theexpectations of others and the need to conformI wonder if you can remember what it was like as a child what it was like to justbe to live and to be joyful without aquestion to live free of doubt and self-criticismit's all about being in the moment enjoying it free of expectations andjust being alive William Blake put it best when he wroteto see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity inthe palm of your hand and eternity in an hour it'sand so beautiful but I guess we think but how can you hold infinity in thepalm of your hand and eternity in an hour is it even possibleyes it is true.you exists in all things and allthings exist within you when you truly understand that you experience theentire universe within yourself and yourself as the entire universe once youexperience that then you grasp that heaven already dwells within you as doesinfinity within that heaven lies all possibilityand all joy and with that infinite space lies infinite wisdom and infinite powerall begins with breath the bridge between your smaller self and yourhigher self let's begin just finding a comfortableplace either seated or lying down making sure there are no

that meanders to theright side of youyou begin to go down to this river and walk alongside it as you do payingattention to the sounds of this river the healing sensations that it deliversto youyou are at peace here there's no oneelse to disturb you only you and natureeach time a thought comes up for you allow that thought to float by and youmight like to project that thought into the river and allow that thought totrickle downstream actually see that thethought beginning to be placed into the river and beginning to leave you watchit as it goes the tune comes to yourmind row row row your boat gently downthe stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dreamthe river and all the stones within the river are here today to have lessons toteach you gentle lessons remindersbecause you already know inherently what it is here to teach you as you continueto walk up a slanted hill the gentle rivers still rolling along beside youyou hear it whisper to you you already have everything

here to tellyou that you are already connected to everything that is and whatever you needwhatever you desire is really only a thought away from your reality it allbegins with a thought you are the co-creator of your life it'salmost like you can let go of the striving this is not by any means beinglazy rather it's simply surrendering to the process and trusting that yourgentle actions are already in place manifesting your desires take a momentnow to visualize the river and put your hands in allow the waters to splash toyour face be grateful for this river and for allyou have within your life at this time you might want to say a silent thank youas you continue on to move upwardsthe Sun peers through the top of the canopy of the rain forest creatingalmost a halo effect around you warming you soothing you you can almost feel thevibration of the cells within your body as they come alive from this beautifulsunlight you stand still in this placeand allow the sun's rays to sink into your mind your body and spiritand so you continuethe gentle sounds of the river following you as you continue on your pathyou take some time now to sit at the riverbank and allow your feet to soakwithin the cool water enjoy the coolnessof the water as it flows between your toes around your feet and feeling thegravelly earth within the riverbed itselfsoothing your feet you might even want to rub them with in this gravelly earthalmost like a massage for your feetas you look upstream you begin to see a bottle floating down with a note insideit as it comes closer to you you catchthe bottle and you pour the cork out and read the note as you open up the notetake a look at what it says you read the note the words materializealmost out of thin air they say you are loved for the uniqueness of who you arego out there and shine and let it be known to the worldhere is another reminder to you that something you inherently already knowand yet sometimes you dismiss this youdon't feel worthy you don't feel that you were good enough well this note ishere to tell you that right now you are loved you are worthy and you are perfectin this very moment and it's calling outfor you to truly recognize this and to acknowledge this to feel this with allyour entire being and once you acknowledge this you give a mission forothers to light up their lives too for others to recognize the love withinthemselves just take a few moments to sit with thisto sit with this love within you you might begin to feel it radiating fromthe inside out allowing your body togrow lighter and shine brighter with every breath in and outyou take this note and you place it back into the bottle and put the cork back onthrowing it back into the river and allowing someone else downstream toreceive the same message you begin toget up and continue on your journey[Music]as you continue on a little squirrel runs past you he stops looks at you youlook at him and even if only for a few moments you connect with him your eyesmeet the squirrel looks peaceful in thisenvironment content and he's here tosimply remind you that in this moment you're content that you can allowthoughts of yesterday and

them[Music]take a moment to fully notice this child let your heart be completely open totheir presence regardless of how they've shown up today[Music][Music]this child moves carefully and as they come within a few meters distance youoffer a few words of kindness and invite them to come and sit next to youknowing they're safe in this visualization they come to take a seatin front of youyou begin this interaction simply by extending the warmth of your heart ontothis small person before you grounded ina wisdom and self compassion that they have yet to develop you hold this energyfor them simply through your presence you offer them your unconditionalacceptance [Music]meeting their eyes you take in the heart and soul of this child and you ask themif there is anything on their heart or mind [Music]leave plenty of space for what arises and if or as they speak listen withoutjudgment simply hold space but whateverit is they are feeling know also that itis okay if they do not have any words to say your inner child may speak throughnonverbal languageand in the face of whatever arises whether that be fear joy anger griefguilt playfulness or anything else you offer them your love you offer thischild your compassion without expectation and without condition letyourself be there Rock as steady as the physical rock beneath youyounurture them in whatever way feels most comfortable for the two of you perhapsthat is through a big hug or through hands held tightly or perhaps it issimply through holding the space for one another know that there is no right orwrong way to nurture your inner child here[Music][Music]and then ask your inner child if there is something they'd like your help withis there something they'd like you to set free for them is there somethingthey would like you to forgive[Music]let this child know that they have your unconditional support in releasinganything that does not serve their sense of happiness and wholeness you as theirwise elder can offer them the love support and forgiveness that they'vebeen yearning for[Music] and nowin the silent space that holds you both next to the lake you might silently repeat to them I seeyou I hear you I love youI am here for you I support youI forgive youI honor youI embrace youI free youtake some more time now to fully embrace this in a child through your lovingpresence through hands held or through a warm and caring hug let this child beheld by your love and by your strength [Music]let this child take the time they need to feel as they feel reminding them thatyou are not here to change them you are simply here to listen and to support[Music] and as they feel heard the inner worldbegins to quiet as does your ownsoon the two of you sit peacefully and contently gazing out over the calmwaters of the lake at dusk [Music]The Sun has disappeared behind the trees and a warm orange glow stretches acrossthe horizon the sky above is ocean blueslowly deepening its turn as the day fades awayyou and your inner child look towards one another and smile you were gratefulfor this moment and for this opportunity to reconnect[Music]you and as the colors of the sky signal thatit is almost time for slumber you ask your inner child where they like to restfor the night perhaps they yearn to go to bed in aplace from your shared past perhaps theylonged to slumber beneath the open starry sky or perhaps they would findthe most peace the most happiness falling asleep in some imagined landthat inspires them wherever your innerchild finds peace and comfort let them know you will guide them there[Music] and then

holdswherever you find yourself invite your inner child to settle into a cozy andcomfortable bed for the night you tuckthem in with love and care reminding them that you are always here for themand as they surrender into the night you whisper the words I love you I am herefor you I love you I am here for you I[Music] love you[Music] I am here for you[Music] spend a few more silent moments whispering these words to your innerchild perhaps aligning the words I love you with your inhalations and I'm herefor you with your exhalationsthe inner child drifts off to sleep and you are left with the revitalized senseof love and care for this part of yourself you set an intention now thatwhen the signs of this inner child arise in you in the future you will tend tothem with unconditional

hold your attention hereimagine a small white light beginning to appear in the center of your chest itexpands outwards with each second that goes by and as it permeates through yourbody it offers its a loving energy to each cell that it passes[Music]soon your entire body is held in this healing white light arising from withinit nurtures every part of you the present self the past self and thefuture self all at the same time[Music] spend just a few more moments nowfeeling yourself as you were bathed in this warm glow[Music]and when you were ready slowly let that light dissipatecome back

then gently let that white light dissipate in your own timenow this will be a journey of clearing and forgiveness and while on the otherside of these processes is deep peace and love the journey itself may bechallenging for some depending upon how you find yourself in this momentoffering yourself or others forgiveness may cause difficult emotions to arise ifthis turns out to be the case for you tonight remember that you can always come back to your breath or your body toground yourself let your heart journey as deep as it ismeant to be in this moment knowing that you are universally supportedso take a moment to find yourself standing outside of a home or cabin thatfeels safe comfortable and welcoming to youit might be a home that you know or one that the mind creates in either caseobserve what its exterior looks like what is it made ofwhat is the surrounding environment likewhat about this abode that warms the heart and soultake a few moments to cultivate an image of this home in your mind letting itbring you a sense of safety and peace[Music] this home has shown up view today toserve as a symbol for coming home to yourself it represents a return to thelove support and care that is within you and so before you make your way insidetake a moment to set an intention to love care for and support yourselfunconditionallyand now as you reach your hand for the door handle you slowly turn pull andmake your way inside standing in thefront hallway you feel an immense sense of relief and gratitude wash over youthe home is exactly what you imagined it would be when you stood outside of ita sanctuary full of love light and beauty that also lives at the very coreof your beingtake a moment to imagine what this hallway looks like what colors are itswalls what details and accents does itboast what artwork adorns itnow you slowly walk down the drifting main hallway soon arriving in a livingspace that is warm at ease and full of soul and charm it contains details bothlarge and small that bring you a sense of coming home to yourself this room isa perfect reflection of who you are at your loving core take a few moments nowto paint in your mind's eye [Music]notice the windows the light and theenergy that this room holdsimagine now that alongside one wall of this room is a mirror tall and wide itreflects back the entire room into the onlookers eyes

this mirror you sense that you are returningto yourself how long you wonder has itbeen since you've been this lovingly attuned to your own inner reflection andyet while love is indeed present here you might find that limiting judgementsabout who you are or where you've been come up to the surface because sometimeswhen we attempt to love cherish or accept ourselves the mind rises with itswhispers of resistance often these innerjudgmental whispers are subtle and yet they can have such a strong effect onhow much love forgiveness and kindness we are able to grant ourselves[Music] so in order to clear whatever storiesthoughts or beliefs that may be holding you back from unconditionalself-acceptance and reconciliation with your true self you look at yourself inthe mirror as you slowly repeat

into theatmosphere around you as you come back to the quiet space with him you meetyour reflection in the mirror once again feeling a wave of gratitude washedthrough you you are grateful for the energies of love kindness andforgiveness is showing up today and you are grateful for this return to yourselffor this inner reconciliationif you need some more time to connect with your loving center imagine yourselfresting a hand upon your heart and breathing into that space eachinhalation brings a wave of self-love and each exhalation frees you from theentanglement of judgment resentment and the pastyou take one last look in the mirror and then you turn away from it and backtowards the beautiful room that holds you and as you rest here grounded inboth the earth and in your heart take a moment to consider if there is anyoneyou might like to offer this loving forgiving and clearing energy to[Music]when you feel ready to simply offer to any individuals or to the universe atlarge the

thecase with any meditation you may experience rising emotions or otherchallenging sensations if these waves come to you know that issafe to feel into them allow the space that holds you the air that surroundsyou and the force that lives within you to carry you through whatever arisesjust surrender these energies to the higher power that supports all of lifenote that each day of this meditation

okay and that whatever comes upis in fact required to be seen in order for you to move through it and finallyknow that you are unconditionally supported through this journey [Music]take a moment now to connect with your breath without attempting to change itin any way simply notice its natural rhythm in this very moment[Music]notice the way that without any action on your part the breaths innate wisdomguides itself into the body gently and back out to the world around you allowyour breath to be your anchor into the present moment throughout this process of letting gofor a few breaths now bring your awareness to your bellysimply observe this part of the body and notice that wherever your attentionflows the breath goes to witness thenatural rise and fall of the stomach with each inhalation and each exhalationnotice the body becoming more relaxed with each deep breath taken and feelthat sinking further into this space that support youtake a moment to bring awareness to the truth that just by being here in thisvery moment you are already beginning the process of releasing by allowing thebody to rest deeply into this present moment you are immersed within thejourney of releasing limited notions that have been carried for quite sometime with your attention turn towardseach breath you are continuously being grounded into the present momentsurrendering your thoughts to that which exists all around you to cosmic energyto the source of all lifethroughout this meditation your mind may become subject to wondering if this isthe case in any moment simply observe this tendency of the mind to lose itsfocus to wander into the past or into the future and into deeply entrenchedbeliefs about yourself or about life in general and know that this movement isentirely natural observe each mentalshift away from the present moment with compassion and non judgment as humanswith the capacity for self consciousness it is entirely natural for the mind towander now if it's here and not to reject or deny these movements but tosimply observe them and then to guide awareness back to the breath or someother anchor to the present moment[Music] with each mental meandering that arisessimply witness it and then guide your attention back to your breath or to thesound of my voice take a few momentshere to gently follow the breath allowing it to guide you further intothis present moment releasing any mentalnotions of the past present or futuresimply allow yourself to be right hereright now[Music]letting go requires a complete surrender of our mental energy often this processbrings up uncomfortable sensations and deep feelings of fear whatever we havebeen holding on to has become interwoven with our experience and expectation ofhappiness letting go requires us to surrender into the deep and knowing that even withoutwhatever beliefs ideas people or objects we have been clinging to we are entirelywhole entirely loved and entirely freeour attempts to control the world around us are born out of fear fear that we maynot receive enough love or money or safety or nourishment or anythingelse for that matter through exerting control we often believe that we canensure that our future will play out the way we hope for it to letting go of thisbelief requires a leap of faith a leap into knowing that everything werequire will be provided by this cosmic force greater than ustake a moment once again to tune in to the breath acknowledging any sensationsfeelings or emotions that may be risingsimply witness these uprisings if they present themselves as passing waves thatdo not belong to you allow them to come and allow them to go without fixating onany mental ideas about what they are why they are there or what their purpose issimply observe them without thoughtwithout judgment and with unconditional acceptance and compassionthe act of surrender requires what may feel like a courageous leap into theunknown and yet on the other side ofthis leap is the sensation of freedomby letting go of our attempts to control or to manipulate the world around us werelease vast stores of energy thisenergy does not disappear from us but instead repurposes itself energy thatwas once tied up in fear becomes energy intertwined with love trust and peacetake a moment now to come into the body due to the intricate interconnection ofmind

knowing deep down in your heart that you are enough as youare it means being comfortable with yourbody your emotions and your mindit means accepting what you have achieved as well as what you have notyet accomplishedacceptance of all your strengths as well as what you may consider your flawsit means being exactly who you are and not who you want others to see you asaccepting yourself is not

tension and to help you fall into a deep andpeaceful sleep of this meditation you will be guided tobring your awareness to each area of the body to feel into it to tighten it andthen to release it completely allowing the entire body to come to a state oftotal relaxation so before we begin thisjourney just ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of if you requirean alarm to be set just quietly set it now if there are blinds that need to bedrawn or bright lights that can be turned off just take care of these smallmatters before settling into a comfortable lying down position[Music]wherever you are and sure that the spine and neck are straight but relaxed andthat you are supported in any way that you need take your time to adjust anycushions or blankets so the gyrus comfortable as possible inthis very moment [Music]set an intention now to fully let go through both body and mind as we enter aprocess of complete release now let'sbegin by becoming more mindful of this exact moment in time and space begin bydrawing your awareness to your ears and to all the sounds that you may currentlybe infiltrating through themyou open your hearing simply observe all the sounds that come from subtle hums tomore prominent noises outside youwithout judging or labeling these sounds practice remaining in a state of deepawareness as vibrations filter into your eardrums and as they disappearallow the Mayans tendencies to categorize to label and the judge tostep aside as you simply witness these noises as dynamic expressions of life assimple and subtle vibrations of energynow expand your awareness of this present moment by beginning to observethe physical space you rest in noticethe air that touches your skin and the material world that supports andsurrounds you [Music]take a few moments to observe each inch of your body that is in contact with thephysical world [Music]you might come to notice the temperature of your body and surfaces around you youmight observe the textures of blankets and pillows that brush against your skin[Music]and you might even observe a barely describable feeling of support of safetyor of heaviness as you sink further intothe surface beneath you[Music][Music]notice if the body's formation or sensory experience changes in any way asyou become more mindful of this physical space you are in[Music]become more mindful now of your breath quietly observing the rhythm and depthof its present form [Music][Music]to be mindful does not mean to change or to manipulate the present moment in anyway that the mind deemed to make better or worthy to the contrary mindfulawareness asks us to open to and to accept this moment exactly as it is sowith this in mind see if you can open to your breath exactly as it is right nowreleasing any judgment or expectation for it to feel any differently than itpresently does [Music]if a natural deepening occurs allow thissimply noticing it as a natural movement of energy further into your being[Music]continue to observe the breath for a few more moments feeling into the expressionof each inhalation and each exhalationnotice the feeling of air entering through your nasal cavity filling yourlungs and pressing upward against yourbelly [Music]and then notice the same dynamic movement in Reverse observing anysensations connected to your fall exhalation [Music]just breathe here in mindful awareness for a few more silent moments[Music]if the mind wanders at any point during this meditation see if you can refrainfrom judgment as you compassionately call your attention back to the presentmoment it is in the minds nature to wander but with that said we can use thepower of our intention to refocus our attention back on this present momentthis refocusing is what helps us to enter an expanding state of complete ofrelaxationin just a few moments we will enter into a full-body scan through which you willbecome deeply aware of the presence of tightness in the body and then of thefeeling of complete relaxation you willbe guided to witness tighten and release each area that we pass allowing eachpart of the body to come to deep rest and complete ease in preparation for apeaceful night's sleep [Music]as much as possible see if you can align tightening movements with yourinhalations and all movements towards release with your exhalationsjust breathe naturally in between each muscle group that we work on[Music] so before we begin into this body scan Iinvite you to make any adjustments now that will help you to feel into theentirety of your body you might find that it is easiest to access each musclewhen in a straight line down position on your back however if this is notcomfortable for you come into a position that is as neutral as possible whileremaining comfortableensure that the chest is open with shoulders drawing away from the earsallow your breath to continue to be in the background of your awarenesssecondary only to your gently shifting awareness of the physical body so beginby noticing your toes feeling into them exactly as they are in this momentnotice if there are any sensations present any tiredness or softness[Music]and now consciously tighten just your toes on your next inhalation observingwhat it feels like for them to be pulled inwards completely and then exhaleletting them go and allowing all tension melting away with ease [Music]now bring your awareness towards both feet toes and ankles included observingthem exactly as they are in this momenton the next breath in tensor muscles in the feet area holding tightly for just abrief moment and then release all of the tension on your exhalation allowing yourfeet toes and ankles to rest back down completely and breathing normally for afew moments [Music]observe now the presence of both of your lakes drawing your awareness all the wayfrom your heels up to your hips noting any sensations you pass along the wayhold the entirety of both legs in your awareness and then inhale as you tightenthese muscles squeezing them in towardsyour midline hold there for a moment andthen exhale releasing them completely into the surface beneath you[Music]moving to the area between the hips draw your awareness to your pelvis on yournext breath in tighten all of these muscles holding them for just a briefmoment and then release them completely on your next breath out just feel intothis complete release from your pelvis downward letting each of these areassink further into the support of the physical world[Music]observe the stomach region now becoming aware of its present stateand then as you inhale tighten all of these core muscles holding them intightly for just a moment as you hold the breath in and then release entirelyas you exhale softening all muscles around the belly return to your naturalbreathing rhythm as you relax the stomach completely[Music]now expand your awareness of the stomach to encompass the entire tosser fromlower back to upper and from belly up to the shoulders take a moment now toobserve each muscle group in the core of your body[Music]now on your next inhalation tighten them or towards the midline of your bodyfeeling them in a contracted state and then release heavily with a sighallowing your entire torso to relax completely [Music]take a moment here to reconnect with your breath mindfully

restcompletely relaxed[Music]draw your awareness now from your wrists all the way up to your shoulders andcompasses all the muscles and areas in between so inhale as you contract all ofthese muscles

opportunitiesto learn evolve and awakenregardless of where this negative energy may have come from I invite you torelease any stories you might hold about wrongdoingand by softening shame and guilt and through opening up to ourselves withcompassion and patience we lovingly create space to release what no longerserves us and to invite in the energy that willso take a moment now to draw your attention to the crown of your headgently softening any tension you might observe here or in the space of thethird eyerelax your shouldersyour arms release your bellyand any other unnecessary tension andthen come back to your breath as we prepare to cleanse our energy fieldthrough the power of this visualizationcalling upon your innate capacity for imagination now I invite you to envisionthat you are on a small chartered boat sailing calmly and gently towards theshore of a pristine tropical islandyou sit or stand at the prow breathing in the fresh salty breeze of the opensea around youyou have charted this small boat for an island getaway for a chance to restreset and cleanse yourself of any negative energy you've been exposed toor have been holding on toand as the boat nears the dock at the shore you feel your shoulders releasingsome of the unnecessary weight they've been carryingno breathing deepensand finally the boat pulls up against the dock overhanging the turquoisewatersyou carefully step on to the steady dock turning to thank the captain and to lethim know that you will be back later in the day then you head on your way yourbackpack is full of all you need for the day and so pulling the straps tight nowyou begin your journey through the pathway that leads through the tropicaljungle oasispalm trees and other lush greenery line the narrow trail you find yourself onbirds ring out in the trees overhead as do chirping insects and croakingamphibiansthe air is completely free of any man-made sounds you relish in this inthe purity of the symphony that fills your earsalready you can feel your lungs being cleansed your breath moving deeper andyour body being filled with pristine air full of vitalityyou continued on a little while longer weaving through the jungle of thisprivate island[Music] eventually you come across a shimmeringAzure Blue Lagoon just off to your rightyou take a moment's pause here kneeling down by the water's edgesomething about this Lagoon feels enchanted something tells you that thewater is listening that it is aware of your presenceso you take this as an invitation to consciously set the intention to releaseany negative energy that has been harbored within you take a moment toformulate this intention in your own wordsand when you were ready you whisper this intention to the pristine mystic watersbefore youyou sense that simply through having set this intention something has beenreleased and that the process of deep cleansing and rejuvenation has beenupgradedso you take a few final moments to absorb the beauty of this Lagoonand then you continue along the path that has gotten ooh this farcontinuing to make your way through the lush environment you've retreated to youfeel a deep sense of gratitude for this opportunity to clear your energy field[Music] not only do you thank the environmentthat is supporting you now but you also feel a sense of appreciation for thepart of you that made this retreat a priority you thank yourself for this actof self-careyou carry on until soon the path widensslowly transitioning from soil to sandand as you make your way through the last layers of trees on this oppositeside of the island your jaw drops at the purity of the white sand beach beforeyou and at the calm turquoise watersthat ripple out from the island you'vearrived at a place where you can allow all remaining negativity to be clearedfrom your being you are certain that this is the place for itand so you take off your shoes carryingthem in one hand as you walk closer towards the water you walk slowlyallowing your feet to sink into the warm sand with each stepa few meters from where the soft wave slap against the shore you drop your bagand your shoes letting your feet ground into the sand rooting yourself throughyour feet you then stretch your arms up towards the sky your heart opens as yourchest pushes forward welcoming the radiance of the Sun the sky and seayou let your arms come to rest by your sides now as you gaze out over the openwaters with not a single other landmassinside you feel as if you're a world away from the everyday you take a deepbreath in and letting it go with a sighand then you lay out your towel and prepare to head into the calm and cleansing watersyou remember the intention you had said to cleanse yourself of any negativeenergies perhaps negative thoughts feelings habits or more subtle energies that nolonger serve you and as you beginwalking towards the water you invite these negative energies to come to theforefront of your mind and you hold themhere not to judge criticize or condemnthem but to silently let them know that you can see them and to let them knowthat it is time for them to be let go[Music]slowly wading into the water you let the cool sea brush against your skinbeginning to cleanse you from the outsidecontinuing on until you are waist-deep you pause and then you bring your palmstogether in front of your body inviting all negative energies to be held betweenthemraising your arms up and overhead you let these negative energies begin movingaway from your bodyand you throw them forward sending them off into the seaas your hands dip underwater all the negative energies you once held begin todissolve in the salty water that surrounds you you let the water tocontinue to cleanse you of all negative energies that you do not wish

or other surface that supportsyou and feeling a sense of gratitude for the comforts that you are provided with[Music][Music] as remaining closed consider the roofover your head and the open air thatsurrounds you now visualize this openair as it becomes the breath entering into your nostrils as you inhale andbeing released from your body with each exhalationas you breathe mindfully let yourself soften further into the earth beneathyou letting all unconscious and unnecessary tension begin to unravel[Music]as your body melts into a deeper state of relaxation the presence of stresshormones begin to decline and the immune system begins to strengthen naturallyreflecting the symbiotic relationship between mind and body our physicalwell-being improves as we consciously and compassionately invite the mind intothis present momentso take a few more moments now to witness the breath as it flows throughyou and with each exhalation let yourbodies surrender more completelyyou might witness and soften the muscles around your eyesyour jaw and tongue your shoulders andarms and your bellyor any other part of you that feels tense in the same way that relaxing themind promotes physical well-being relaxing the physical body encouragesease and release of the mindin a minute or two we will begin a visual journey of immune systemstrengthening but for now let's just take a few more moments to deepen thebody's relaxation response first allowall the air in your lungs gently to be released to the atmosphere around youand together let's just take a deep full breath into the bottom of the belly andthen slowly let it back out another longdeep breath in and when you're ready let it back outone more full belly reaching breath now making it even longer this time and onceyou've reached the top slowly release all the air back out to the world around you let your breath come back to itsnatural rhythm now as you mindfully observe it for just a few more moments on your ownnow as we slowly transition into our visualization take a moment to draw yourattention to the space before your closed eyesthough the mind might conjure up images and ideas when left unchecked an openspace of unlimited creative potential exists before the mind's eye when weslow down quiet down and tune in and itis upon this canvas now that I invite you to imagine yourself seated on atreehouse balcony overlooking a radiant singing rain forests of Central America[Music] the Sun glistens in the sky casting itslight upon the treetops above you theair is warm and humid earthy and pure you take a long deep breath in and outfeeling a strong but subtle wave of gratitude washed through you from whereyou sit or you can see is the untouched rainforest a sea of green spreading inevery direction your gaze turns towards an intuitive understanding of thevitality and health of this rainforest rises to your awareness inspiring you toventure through this ecosystem to experience its restorative and healingpotential and yet you take a moment now to noticehow you feel in this very moment in these moments before heading on your wayperhaps you feel tired perhaps you feel well or unwell perhaps you feel what youwould call normal or average maybe numbness or discomfortwhatever is the case view now ear on your perch above the rainforest simplynotice it without attaching yourself to the feelings and sensations movingthrough you just notice what is here [Music]if there is any discomfort tension orunease send those sensations your loveyour care and your patience as you prepare for a journey into greaterhealth vitality and immunity[Music]now you've heard that somewhere not far from the tree house lives a wise healera mystical woman who knows all about the healing elements and herbs of thisrainforest and who may be able to grant you with the greatest sense of healthand well-being and so trusting your intuition to guideyou in the right direction you pack a backpack with all the essentials you'llneed for the day and then you begin yourjourney you start by climbing down from your treehouse rung by rung gentlymaking your way onto the earthfeet firmly rooted in the soil beneath you you take a moment to mindfullyinhale the fresh nourishing rainforest air once again and as you exhale youtake your first step down the foot path that leads you to the main roadnot far from your private perch in those natural lands the main road is humbleand unpaved just a few metres wide itweaves its way quietly through the rainforest [Music]mindful step-by-step you make your waydown it in the direction your heart guide you as you walk you note thesilence between the forest symphony the air is both quiet and lively modest andconfidentbirds call to you from the overarching canopy as does the breeze the cicadasand the howler monkeys the orchestraawakens you softening the rational and analytical mind as it guides you deeperinto the beauty and mystery of the worldyou continued on for a short while until a path appears on your right-hand sideas if silently calling you towards it you are drawn in its directionand so deciding to venture off the main road you take a leap of faith as youmake your way down this narrow footpath into the unknown[Music] as you meander seemingly aimlessly younote that your body begins to shift shoulders begin to softenreleasing knots of tension they have held onto for quiet some time nowyour belly begins to relax expanding andsoftening with each full deep breathyour eyes begin to widen taking in moreof the surroundings than they are accustomed to absorbingand your jaw begins to unclench sinkinginto greater comfort and ease[Music] your feet tread lightly as if kissingthe earth and you sense yourself coming into greater alignment with the naturalworldyou continue on for some time taking in the surroundings through open eyes ismind and heart great big beautifulflowers in magenta tangerine and lilactones break up the pervading greenery of the forest meanwhile your ears continueto absorb the sounds of the nearby creatures frogs now chiming in alongsidethe cicadas birds and monkeysyour expanded state of mind takes in the wonder of this incredible vibrant spacereflecting upon how healing these natural ecosystems arehow can it be you wonder that we have yet to truly learn from thewisdom of these natural ecosystemsand then your heart fully expanded nowtakes in the love and beauty of this rainforest you feel an immense wave ofgratitude wash through this loving energy center and so you silently offera word of thanks to the natural lands you move across you thank them forproviding you with just the sort of healing you had yearned for[Music]you continued on a little while further until another path comes into view thistime is on your left-hand side and is even narrower than the one you are onyour intuition tells you it is the path to take and so you turn down withconfidence and curiositythe path weaves in and out of the tropical trees bringing you into even acloser contact with its wonder the broadleaves are close enough that they nearly brush your cheeks leaving you for amoment to question if you are going the right way and yet just as you begin todoubt the path you've chosen something opens up to you it is a small clearingin the forest in the center of it an elderly womanstands gazing up at the branches of the surrounding trees she's dressed in along burnt orange dress and is wrapped in a loosely knit Shore the silverbraided hair is wrapped in front of her left shoulder and as she stands there itseems as if she is whispering to the trees and then listeningand whisperingand then listening [Music]you cough quietly to let her know you were here completely unstart 'old by your presenceshe turns to you slowly and welcomes you with a warm smile you make your waytowards her and she invites you to sit down on a long bench in the center ofthe clearing she sits next to you and asks what brings you here you begin totell her that what you longed for is a greater sense of health and well-beingparticularly in the area of immunity you yearn for a system that is strong andresilient and you believe that perhaps this rainforest might hold what you needshe embraces every word you speak and lets you know that it is possible toinvite greater balance into your body through any and all acts of self-careincluding through the words and images you hold in your mind she invites you tobegin by taking a dip in the healing blue lagoon just a short walk from hersacred circle and upon your return shewill have concocted an herbal tea that will heal and balance your body andenhance its immunityyou take her advice and follow the pathway she points you towardsveering down a small hill and around a few more bends in the path you soonarrived at a break in the treeline we're turquoise waters reflect back atyou from a short distance a small set ofstairs guide you down towards the water's edgeand as you step off the final stair youtake a moment to absorb the fullness of this landscape you have never seen waterso bright so clear so radiantafter preparing to head into these cool and cleansing waters you inch your wayslowly into the lagoon the water movesgently up your body until soon it hasreached your waistyou went to the water to as comfortable as you possibly canand if you choose to dunking your head under the water and up again[Music] the Sun is still high in the sky beamingdown on you from its steady place there [Music]you close your eyes and surrender to the lagoon knowing that it will support youyou take a full deep breath in and asyou exhale you envision all heaviness or constriction and all imbalances leavingyour body you take another full breath in andexhaling once again you envision yourself releasing all the thoughts allthe ideas and all the physical imbalances that inhibit you fromexperiencing radiant health[Music] and now that space has been created within you for the new you consciouslylet your next inhalation fill you with the sun's healing energy it enters yourlungs is a warm golden glow cleansing this part of the body's defense systemcompletelythen as the sun's golden light seeps further into your body it cleanses andbrings balance to your lymphatic system your spleen your thymus your white bloodcells and all other parts of your body'simmune system[Music] as it spreads through you from within itcontinues to penetrate you from the outside as the Sun continues to beatdown on your bare skin[Music]you spend a few more moments here soaking up the healing energy of the Sunoff the breath and of the water you rest in knowing that only when all systemsand elements are healthy can we experience true health and vitality[Music]when you were ready you slowly make your way back towards the shore dryingyourself off with the towel and preparing to head back your entire bodyfeels light and free full to the brim with energy and vitalityyou take the small pathway back to where you encountered the wise woman before she awaits your return with a fresh cupof a hot herbal teathe two of you hold silence as you bow your head and accept the mug she extendsto you and as you let the warm immune-boostingliquid flow through you you trust that you already have and continue to comeback into balance to come back to your innate capacity for strength

days andyears to come rest of both body and mind she says isone of the most underrated and yet most important factors of a healthy internaldefense system you smile thanking heronce more and then you slowly head back in the direction of your very own treehousefirst you navigate your way down the narrow rainforest encroaching pathwaytowards the wider footpath then youfollow this wider path until you arrive at the main road and the main roadguides you back to the pathway up to your heartand before you know it you were resting on the hammock that swings on yourbalconyyour entire body rests with ease and yet you can feel the awakened empoweredenergy that flows through you[Music] you remember the healing light of the Sun that entered your lungs as youfloated in the turquoise lagoon and
