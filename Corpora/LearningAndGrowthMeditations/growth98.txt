take a few moments to sit
comfortably ideally with your back
straight
and with your soles of your feet on the
floor
as we begin now with three minutes of
focusing on
our breath so we breathe in
[Music]
breathe
keep this flowing if you need to just
pause for a moment that's okay
we're looking to do this for three
minutes breathing in
and breathing out and no space in
between the in-breath
and out-breath as we right now
start to fill ourselves up with
oxygen spreading oxygen to
every cell of our body
[Music]
that's one minute if you want to take a
pause take a pause for a moment
feel alive become aware of what it's
like
to be more oxygenated oxygen
is the fountain of your life of your
existence
and if you want to start again let's
start again
breathing in and breathing out
breathing in and breathing out
just the constant flow
of oxygen spreading it to every cell of
your body
from your nose to your toes from your
toes to your hands
and from your hands to your heart
and to your head and all through your
body as you continue to allow
oxygen to flow
that's two minutes let's go for
another minute if you want to take a
rest for a moment that's fine
are you ready let's go again breathe in
that's perfect keep going another 30
seconds
allowing yourself to feel
great to feel yourself alive
to be in the present moment
beautiful just another 20 seconds
focusing on your breath if your mind
wanders
it's fine just bring it back
another 10 seconds
amazing you are
incredible that's three minutes
now take a moment to think about
three different things different moments
in your life where you felt
gratitude picture one of those things
right now see it
hear it feel it
remember what you saw what you heard
what you felt
and imagine right now stepping back into
that moment
that's it feel the grateful flow
coming from your heart into your head
right through your body
re-live it
gratitude is so
powerful and you can take that memory
and just bring it to life
as we move on to the second thing in
your life that you're
you're grateful for it could be a person
it could be an experience that you had
where you felt so grateful so much
love love is this supreme
emotion and we experience love when we
feel
gratitude see what you saw
hear what you heard back then or feel
what you feel when you think of this
experience or
this person emotionalize that
right now in every
cell of your body
feel that gratitude flow
yourself up right now
bring the memory of the person to life
better than ever
[Music]
as we now move on to the third
experience or person that you feel or
people
that you feel so much gratitude for
see it hear it feel it
turn it up emotionalize it
be inspired
take control of your mind your body
your emotions feel that power
that energy flow
allow your nervous system to get fired
up
and feel that flow and wear that smile
as you train your mind like you
never have done before
and right now as you take those three
things those three moments those three
people whatever it is for you
and put it all together and feel that
connection between your brain
and your heart
allow yourself to feel more gratitude
than you felt before
give that gratitude a color
and send that color to every part of
your body
as you fill yourself up and you take
that feeling
and you double that feeling and you
triple
that feeling and you quadruple the
feeling
to the point where gratitude is coming
out
of your body in front of you behind you
above you
beneath you everywhere and
send that gratitude off
to people who need it people you love
people you care people you meet every
day
people all over the world as you beam
gratitude out into the world the
attitude
of gratitude is one of the biggest
things which makes
the biggest difference to the world
that's right and now let's think of
three things
in your life that you want to have
happen
things that you're working on pick one
of them
and see it in the future it doesn't
matter how
clear that is it's just an idea
but what brings an idea to life
is your ability to smile to feel
grateful and to see that thing having
been done with
clarity with a sense of faith
what is faith it's your ability to see
what it is that you want to have happen
even before
it's done and feel that dynamic
tension of being drawn towards the thing
that
you want to have happen in your life
feel it be it become it
as you right now focus on the next thing
in your life
that you want to finish or complete
and see it as if it's already been done
as einstein said reality doesn't exist
in the outside world reality exists
inside your own head
and the people who achieve things are
the ones who have the foresight
like you have now to see what it is that
you're working on
having been completed you owning that
thing
that's it see it hear it feel it
emotionalize the fact that you have
already
achieved what it is that you're working
on
give it more life give it more substance
give it more meaning become
one of the two percent of people around
the world it uses
their imagination the workshop that we
have
inside our minds and body the gift of
creation
and now think of the third thing or
maybe it's
one of the first two you're just gonna
do it again it really is up to you
something that you want to see
done finished completed
be grateful for the fact that you now
are able to see this
feel it and step into it
like it's already been done you have
this ability
you're doing it right now
feel the feeling of completion
your ability to take an idea take the
feeling like it's already been done
and just just to get on and make it
happen
it's all about action
emotionalize it feel that tension that
is
a positive tension that draws you
towards where it is that you want to go
you are amazing you are awesome
well done take a few minutes once again
to focus on your breath
as we bring this little training because
this is what this is this
is my 365.
this is you working on being the very
best
that you can be we have this old brain
in an incredible body with a heart and
for us to make our brains and hearts
work together
much more effectively we have to train
train ourselves to thrive this is 10
minutes
of your time your valuable time
you make a difference take all of this
bring it all together
allow your whole body to come alive your
mind your body your soul
everything emotionalize it anchor it
what i mean by anchoring it is
take a deep breath in and maybe clench
your fists
or stretch your arms up in the air and
allow yourself to feel
this in every part of your body because
the more
you do this the more you'll feel
wonderful
the more you'll be able to access this
because
greatness comes in many forms but for me
two of the greatest things that you can
do is see where you want to go and hear
it and feel it
and be compelled to move towards it
and then the second thing you can do is
recognize that in every moment in every
day
you always have a choice between what
happens the stimulants
and the response practice this every day
and see the difference it makes to your
life my 365
is about you becoming the inspired
person
you becoming someone who you want to
follow
this takes training and time and energy
and commitment
but it's worth it thank you for your
time today
do this every day and let's take you and
your life
to a whole new level let's help you
become the hero in your own life
you
