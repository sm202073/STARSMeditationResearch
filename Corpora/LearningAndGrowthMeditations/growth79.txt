begin this practice by letting your body
get nice and cozy
whatever that looks like for you
lovingly close your eyes
untune your awareness in words
noticing your breath
your body
any Sensations occurring within you
and letting the weight of gravity take
over
as you relax into your body
taking a moment
to adjust your muscles as needed
to let them all become soft and loose
there is nothing to hold on to here
safe to let go
to let the muscles in your face become
Slack
to let your shoulders drop down
to let any other muscles that you do not
need right now
become still
relaxed
and at peace
and as you feel yourself sinking down
more deeply with the weight of gravity
you become aware of a red rose in the
middle of your chest inside your heart
he even feel as though you smell a
beautiful fragrant red rose now
notice how each petal in your heart
is perfect healthy whole
even glimmering slightly
this radiant red rose
is fresh
blooming fully
in its peak in its prime
notice how that energy feels radiantly
glowing in your heart
you may notice it feels fresh
and free
full of love
possibility
blooming with a sense of boldness
a fervent trust in life
and as you tune into its energy you ask
yourself does the Rose resist its bloom
you feel an immediate no answer within
you
a rose cannot resist its Bloom for it is
natural
it's a natural unfolding process
so too is the nature of your life
at Birth
like a flower
you are but a seed
and within the seed contained the
blueprint of the whole
the growing stems and leaves
tiny bud
the blooming and blossoming flower
and eventually the returning into the
Earth
the seed of the flower does not fear the
cycle
and therefore it just happens naturally
and you watch the beautiful Blooms of
flowers take place in the summer
new experience many cycles of Summer
cycles of spring fall and winter
there are natural cycles in your life
just like in all plants and animals on
the planet
you are not separate from that
[Music]
when you relax and Trust in the flow
when you are non-resistant towards your
life
everything unfolds naturally perfectly
and with ease
you can trust that each step each
passing moment
each smile each
each grimace
every experience
is a beautiful natural unfolding
you are the beautiful simultaneous
Observer of your life
and player in The Game of Life
balancing the mix of the two perfectly
through non-resist
you imagine yourself standing before a
cliff with your arms outstretched wide
you may even feel called to let your
arms stretch out wide
breathe into this feeling
of being open
imagining a cool breeze brushing against
your face breathing in the fresh air
feeling this truth in the fact that
there is always another inhale behind
every exhale
trusting that as long as you live
it's safe
keep breathing in
to keep welcoming in
everything life has to offer you
in truth
all that life has to offer you is love
everything else is an illusion created
by your resistance
when we go forth
without resistance trusting in life
then only love exists
Only Love is Real
we're not placing forth the illusions of
resistance when we move about life this
way
as you feel yourself standing freely
an open air Arms Wide Open wind blowing
through your hair
you again tune in to the wisdom of the
blossoming flower in your chest
and simply tune in to its energy of
non-resistance
of perfect flow
Divine timing and harmony
if you had chosen to have your arms out
at your side of course bring them down
anytime you need to
then as you tune into that feeling of
non-resistance
you affirm to yourself I am that I am
life unfolds perfectly for me
trust in each
unfolding moment
I welcome every moment
with the love
on your next inhale breathe an extra
deeply stomach and rib cage fully
expanding holding your breath at the top
and when you are ready exhale with a
sigh
now that you know this feeling of
non-resistance versus resistance
you can greet life head on
if you feel resistance recognize
you've created some kind of block some
kind of fear
but what's real is love
and when you can trust in that
you can move forth the same way nature
does
knowing it's all a natural unfolding of
love
and nothing more
take this solemn truth with you
as you begin to roll your shoulders
wiggle your fingers and toes
and when you're ready open your eyes
back to the world around you
wonderful job today
