a mirror to the divine this meditation
is based upon the teachings of dr. Joe
Dispenza karma killer John Jones and our
principles and practices of hypnosis and
mystical meditation
it is designed to help you recognize
your own divine nature and help you
decide enta PHY from any ego parts that
may be experiencing fear beliefs
negative emotions or states of
limitations so begin when you're ready
by finding a comfortable place where you
can either sit or lay down
[Music]
[Music]
once you're comfortable and relaxed you
can close your eyes as you close your
eyes feel the heaviness of the muscles
around your eyes
the muscles around your eyes are so
relaxed and heavy that even if you
wanted to open your eyes you couldn't
allow yourself to have this time of
quiet of relaxation and begin to send a
wave of relaxation of the same nature as
the relaxation of the muscles around
your eyes throughout your entire body
from the top of your head all the way
down to your fingertips and to your toes
as you continue to relax your body you
sink deeper and deeper and deeper into a
state of inner peace and relaxation
as you sink deeper and deeper into deep
relaxation you become aware of the space
around your body the vast emptiness of
space around your body
and as you allow yourself to become
aware of that space your Werner's of
that space expands reaching further and
further away into space to the sides the
front the back of your body
now in the vast emptiness of space
imagine feel or visualize yourself
traveling down an ancient path
and as you travel down this ancient path
you find yourself in the middle of a
forest
aware of the space around you you move
deeper and deeper into the forest and
somewhere along the path in the forest
you see little clearing while light is
shining and you decide to go and explore
is clearing
in the middle of the clearing there is a
little pond
[Music]
you gently approach this pound
and as you approach this pond you can
see the reflection of your own self on
the surface of the pond
as you look and observe the images or
simply feel it if you're not seeing it
maybe you see images of yourself younger
older in different bodies different
lives
and you just observe
maybe you see projections of your
thoughts your emotions your personality
reflected on the pond and you're simply
observing these images being projected
on the ponds
as you observe these images or feel them
become aware of the feelings the
sensations that are associated with them
without clinging or grasping simply
noticing the emotional charge whether
you feel happy or not whether you're
having a judgment or not as all of these
images and projections of self are
reflected on the pond
now as the images continue to appear and
disappear send each and every one of
them love from your heart
placing your awareness at your fourth
energy center on your heart and the
space around your heart
filling the space around this energy
center as you observe or feel these
images and the associated emotions with
them
continue breathing through your heart
feeling sending love to all of these
parts all of these projections of self
on the surface of the pond
[Music]
as you continue with this process
keeping your awareness at your fourth
energy center your heart center opening
your heart breathing through it
connecting to the feelings of love you
feel lighter brighter more relaxed more
connected to your divine nature less and
less identified with the images the
projections on the surface of the pond
loving each and every one of them into
the light of pure consciousness
[Music]
dissolving merging back into oneness
now there are less and less images being
projected on the surface of the pond
upon this serene flat reflective of
light
and as you see this light you recognize
yourself in the light
[Music]
you recognize that the light is a
reflection of your own soul your own
divine nature
and you connect to the beauty of this
light
it's magnificence
you recognize yourself in the light of
pure consciousness
and you know that all of these images
all of these projections of self are
constantly in the process of merging
back with the right
and as you gain this insight is
understanding your heart opens even more
and as your heart opens more you see
this reflected in the brightness of the
light that is reflected on the surface
of the pond
the more your heart opens the brighter
the light and the brighter the light the
more your heart opens
[Music]
and you become aware of this dance
between you and the divine between your
heart and the light of pure
consciousness
and what would you like to see reflected
in the pure light of consciousness on
the pond what qualities what elevated
emotions would you like to see reflected
would you like to connect to
as you connect to the feelings of all of
unconditional love of joy
a pure love for life a deep sense of
freedom and lightness wholesomeness
what are you connecting with
what emotions how are you choosing in
this present moment to connect to pure
consciousness what aspects of the divine
are you embodying that you are seeing
reflected in the pond in the light
and as you recognize those aspects of
the divine within yourself your heart
continues to open and you feel these
deep sense of gratitude for this
experience for this realization
realizing that you've always been one
with the divine and that you will
continue to be one with the divine for
the rest of eternity
feeling inspired by this moment
feeling grateful for it in all of it
you decide that you will come back to
this pond anytime you feel the desire to
anytime that you wish to see yourself in
your true light anytime that you may go
into self judgment self blame or
criticism
you will go back to this pond and allow
yourself to see yourself in the true
light of who you are feeling enriched by
this experience he decide to go back on
this path where others have worked
before
feeling light feeling free with your
heart open
you find yourself back in this room you
find yourself back in the space where
you first started this journey back in
your body a new body a body that is
filled with the light of the Divine her
body that is aware of the miracles the
healing that can be achieved in the
presence of pure consciousness
and in this new body in this new time in
this new place as you come back you
remember all of the insights and
understandings that you gained through
this experience and you remember your
true nature and the pact you made with
yourself to come back to this pond to
come back to this realization of your
true nature
anytime that you feel lost hurt in pain
or in the illusion of being separate
from the divine from your true nature
feeling grounded in your body you can
begin to deepen your breath feel the
flow of energy moving through the entire
body from head to toes awakening you
bringing your back in this space and
time in a new body
feeling recharged energized in love with
yourself in love with your divine nature
when you're ready you can gently open
your eyes and begin to embody your
divine nature your true self in every
moment of your day
you
