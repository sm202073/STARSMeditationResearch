allow your body to get very
relaxed
whatever position most supports you to
do this
trust yourself
and get into that position now
[Music]
once you're ready
softly
close your eyes
and begin to tune in
to your breath
and your body
allowing your breath
to slow
down now
and begin to become more intentional
belly expanding on every in-breath
and contracting on every out-breath
[Music]
allowing the air to flow smoothly
and
[Music]
gently as you scan your awareness
to find any muscles you're holding on to
that you do not need right now
[Music]
allow gravity to take over
[Music]
only using the muscles that you need
right now
and letting all of the others
relax
[Music]
it is safe
for you to allow your body
to be heavy right now
it is safe for you
to relax
[Music]
you now begin to receive
an energetic massage
as you feel the highest most loving
energy
entering in
you may see this as white light
but either way
feel
the love
[Music]
it may feel like tingling
massaging
[Music]
peaceful sensations
[Music]
relax
and
allow
trust and know
you are getting your body ready
to do this magnificent work
[Music]
this experience
is for your highest
most loving good
[Music]
allow yourself to relax
even more now
[Music]
dropping
down
[Music]
letting go
[Music]
and you begin to see yourself
walking down
a long
dark
corridor
with a golden glowing light at the end
this space you're walking through feels
peaceful
[Music]
and yet mysterious in a way that sparks
your curiosity
compelling you to continue to walk
towards the golden light
the closer you get
the brighter it becomes
until you step out of the corridor
and enter in
to bright
golden glittering light
[Music]
it's as if you are suspended
in the center
of this golden light
[Music]
it's as if you are deep
within
your mind
[Music]
take a couple more breaths
relaxing
in this space
[Music]
and notice that all around you in a
circle right now
[Music]
appear your highest most loving guides
some may be different versions of you
or perhaps you just feel
sense or see energy forms
either way
feel the love and support here
[Music]
one of these guides reaches out their
hand
to give you a golden seed
[Music]
you place this seed in the palms of your
hands
and gaze at it lovingly
[Music]
in this seed
you affirm the following thoughts
ensuring the energy of these thoughts
and feelings
enters into the scene
i am love
i am fortunate
all is well
[Music]
spend a few more breaths infusing this
scene
with more
loving thoughts that come to you now
[Music]
and as you feel these thoughts
allow yourself to be very aware
of how the seed is being infused with
the energy of these thoughts
[Music]
me
[Music]
[Music]
allow yourself to wrap up your thoughts
and notice how this seed is glittering
in golden light
[Music]
and imagine
you are planting the scene
in the center
of your mind
[Music]
covering it
metaphorically
with earth
trusting whatever that looks or feels
like to you
[Music]
and more importantly
feeling
the seed being planted
[Music]
feeling your energy
transforming as it is
and with this seed within you
[Music]
and your highest most loving guides
around you
you affirm to yourself
i am that i am
[Music]
feel deeply appreciative to yourself for
showing up for this
practice appreciative for the changes
that are to unfold from here
[Music]
and when you're ready take a nice big
deep breath in stomach and rib cage
fully expanding
holding your breath when you reach the
top
and when you're ready exhale with a sigh
[Music]
begin to bring your awareness back to
your body where it is right now
[Music]
as your breath returns to whatever pace
feels good to you
you take this beautiful feeling you've
created with you
as you begin to roll your shoulders
[Music]
wiggle your fingers
and your toes
and when you're ready
open your eyes
back to the world around you
wonderful job today
the more you return to this practice
the more you replant these beautiful
positive messages and energies within
your subconscious
continue to return to this practice time
and time again
for your highest most loving good
thank you for being here dear love
we're so grateful for the work you're
doing that ripples out to the world
around you
sending so much love
you
