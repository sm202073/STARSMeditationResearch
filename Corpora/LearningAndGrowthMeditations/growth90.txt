[Music] it is our intention that these meditations guide you towards the
abundant life you deserve not just financial and material abundance but
living an abundant life with love happiness and joy we are here to tell
you that you can you can have what you want and we are here supporting you we
are here for you and we believe that you can be truly happy and have the life you
want the first six tracks are about going within we will begin within it has
been stated by many wise ones throughout history that we are vibrational energetic beings we are going to start
the process of awareness of the unseen part of ourselves and from that powerful
place we will manifest our desires by using our thoughts and our feelings
getting right into that feeling place when manifesting is like supercharging
your desires and speeding up the receiving process rather than just repeating ideas and affirmations because
when you feel it your brain thinks that it already exists then the law of attraction brings you exactly what you
feel it is our intention that this be the beginning or the continuation of you
becoming conscious of yourself and from that place of inner awareness to create
an extraordinary life for yourself just by being who you truly are and in doing
so help others do the same please do not listen to the first six tracks while you're driving our
operating heavy machinery the last six tracks are about telling the new story of you if you just focus
on the reality you see around you now you will only keep getting what you have let go of how things are now as they are
only the product of what you have previously thought and believed you can create your life however you wish it to
be the only limitations that exist are the ones you put on yourself lay the
foundation of your new improved life believe it is possible get playful with
your imagination you might feel like a bit of a crazy person when you start or you may feel like you are lying to
yourself but all that you are doing is taking your attention off what is what
you have already created in your life and telling a new story that will show up the more you believe it and the more
you tell it the trick is when you come out of the meditations if your mind
wants to go back to complaining about the way it is now just try to relax
don't give those thoughts too much attention and fill your thinking up as much as possible with the new story
repetition will help you physically to create new pathways in your brain you
will change your life the power is yours

if we see ourselves from this consciousness place and see how our
thoughts are creating our level of existence we can see how we are in the
driver's seat you can create your
reality by thinking properly imagine watch feel what happens to your body or
what you bring into your life when you think negative thoughts from the
perspective of your inner being observe what happens to your body and
surroundings when you think thoughts of self-loathing when you think thoughts of doubt when
you think thoughts of unworthiness what do you think thoughts of fear can you
see hear or feel how that this thinking is not in alignment with who you really
are with what you really are now observe
thoughts of love compassion happiness fulfillment
expansion feel from the perspective of your higher self your inner being your soul
the one that is connected to source freedom is denying that
you are the thinker of your thoughts you can be the thinker of your thoughts you
don't have to live with the illusion that your thoughts just happen and that
they are separate from you who you truly are can have effect on your thinking
higher mind higher perspective higher vibration I have frequency bring your
attention to your breath breathing
deeply in and out bring your attention
to your breath breathing deeply in and out
bring your awareness to in between your eyebrows breathing deeply into that space
turning around becoming the observer

breathing deeply as the observer as your higher self your inner being your soul
the energy that is truly you I am
nothing I am unworthy of happiness my life sucks
bad things always happen to me no one
loves me as the conscious being that you
are right now how do these thoughts make you feel breathing deeply in and out be
the observer keep your attention looking into your mind in your heart and your
body you are your inner being your higher self or your soul now try these
thoughts I feel good I feel whole I feel
happy I feel safe I'm allowing the universe to bring me
good things I am allowing the universe to help me I can hear my intuition I can
hear my guidance I follow my good feelings I feel love I feel joy even if
some of these feel far away from you right now I still feel better than thoughts of
lack doubt and limitation little steps to retrain your brain to think properly
if you're not sure go to or remain in the place of your inner being your
higher self listen to the answers and they will come the quickest way to
retrain your thinking is not necessarily to try and catch every thought as this
will sometimes be extremely overwhelming anger make the hole deeper
so simply relax if you notice a thought
that doesn't feel good which means it's not in alignment with who and what you
really are then relax go back to the relaxation
meditation let go release imagine
letting go of your thinking this may sound like a contradiction however the
more you can let go release the holding the trying to change
the effort the fighting the more you will allow the space for new softer
thoughts and feelings to flow release your thinking relax allow space for your
higher self your inner being to fill your mind with thoughts that make you feel good or even just a little better
[Music] let go of your thoughts imagine untangling them and letting them
flow out of your head hell our space in there for more feeling good thoughts
which will ultimately lead to higher minded conscious thinking bring your
attention back to your breath breathing deeply in and out
