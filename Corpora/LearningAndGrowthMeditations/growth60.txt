today you will be able to clear an
opening
in this new year or new chapter of your
life
for you to move into
a shift is on the horizon
and with a little guidance you can steer
the course
of how your life's journey unfolds
welcome to the mindful movement i'm
sarah raymond and i'm honored to provide
you with space today to explore your
mind
now let's begin
[Music]
i invite you to make yourself
comfortable
and free of distractions
[Music]
allow yourself to settle in
knowing this is a time
for deep relaxation
[Music]
notice if there is any tension in your
body
or maybe there is a busyness in your
mind
it's completely okay
[Music]
over the next several minutes
you will be able to let both your body
and your mind
descend into a pleasant
sense of calm
if you haven't already
gently allow your eyes to close
for the next few moments
i will guide you to connect with your
body
beginning by resting your attention
on your breath
observe the rhythm of your breath
expansion
and release
now add a little ease
into the flow
your breath will be letting your body
loosen a bit
on each exhale
[Music]
on the inhale
see if you can quiet your breath a
little
invite a slowing down
of the inhale
as if to minimize any sound
that is produced
[Music]
then as you exhale
[Music]
let aside
fall out of your body
way to gravity
letting go deeper into the surface
that supports you
continue this process for
several more breath cycles
a very slow
light inhale through your nose
followed by
a heavy
exhale
letting your body
go a bit
further
[Music]
now bring your attention to your feet
on your next exhale
release any tension
you may be holding
in your feet
allow the heaviness of your breath
to connect with your legs
and soften them
with your exhale
knowing that you are safe and supported
you can let your legs
and hips
begin to melt
into the surface below you
now feel the movement in your belly
notice its rise as you inhale
notice its fall
as you exhale
unwind
any lingering tension
or gripping
of your belly muscles
[Music]
allow your belly to swell
and fall
as if it were a lazy wave
in the sea
shift your awareness further up now to
your heart space
can you connect with your beating heart
there is so much of what makes you
uniquely you
held in this space
your heart space will help guide you on
this journey today
[Music]
deep down in your heart
you know
exactly what you need today
i am only here to give you space
to create what is needed
and invite you to listen more deeply
[Music]
you can go within
and trust your heart
to guide you
and in doing so
it's warmth
and energy will expand
feel the space
around your heart
feel its energy beginning to expand
in every direction
there is a light inside you
and it needs to shine
[Music]
as you continue to relax
and connect with the light
within your heart
you can begin to tap into your
imagination
for a little while now
[Music]
you are safe in your mind
to visualize yourself outside
standing at the edge of a meadow
this may be a familiar place
or one that exists only in your
imagination
most importantly
you know you are safe
and you feel that there doesn't seem to
be
any rush to move
[Music]
you are only taking in the scenery for
now
it is an absolutely beautiful scene
with a skyline
over the horizon
that is inviting your gaze
the light in the distance is filling up
the sky beautifully
it is bright
yet your eyes are thirsty to take it all
in
[Music]
the meadow before you
is full of soft tall grasses
rich
in light greens and yellows
spreading into the distance
where the horizon
meets the bright sky
the temperature is just right
and the air is crisp and clean
as you gaze into the horizon
there appears to be a subtle flicker
in the distant sky
a soft flash of light
it's not alarming at all but it invites
your attention
you notice a flicker of a faint
image it's an image from your recent
past
[Music]
there are multiple images
and they seem to be representing an area
of your life
where you desire to change
something is telling you that you do not
need to dwell on these images
these scenes are only reminders
that these are moments of your past
you know in this present moment
you are exactly where you need to be
pause for a moment now free of judgment
of what you are noticing
this is the moment
you begin to move forward
and act as the architect
of your upcoming experiences
[Music]
you begin to step forward
into the grassy meadow
[Music]
and although the grass is tall
as you step
the blades of grass fall down before you
it's as if your foot
makes a light contact
and the grass simply tumbles down
like dominoes
revealing the direction
of your
path looking down at the falling grass
a beautiful
glistening of yellows and greens
captivates your senses
as you continue slowly
you notice
the distant sky
no longer shines
with those previous images
it appears to be
an inviting blank slate
waiting for your new
ideas
and your new visions
it's time to declare to yourself
where you are intending to go
this is a journey of your own design
you have a clear opening
a blank slate
for this new year
or new chapter of your life
you have created a shift
on the horizon
and you can steer the course
of how your life's journey
unfolds
now is time to visualize
a scene
from this upcoming year
this next phase in your life
what is it that you want to see
how would you like it to unfold
[Music]
imagine a specific scenario
maybe an event you are attending
or an interaction with someone
perhaps
a work experience
or something that reflects
how you will be spending your time
you are beginning to notice something
emerge
in the sky ahead
you can see yourself
you can see yourself having made the
changes you desire
you see what it all looks like
you can look deeply
as the image is revealed with even more
clarity
[Music]
there are multiple images
or ideas
representations of you
amidst
several different experiences
[Music]
look at yourself
see how it looks to
watch yourself
fulfilled
look at your face
and see your emotions
[Music]
how does it feel
feel it in your body right now
sense what it feels like
as if these changes have already taken
place
now think of the steps along the way to
get there
imagine those steps being laid out in
front of you with ease
throughout this beautiful meadow
you can see the path
clearly now
there is a comfort emerging within your
body
it is reassuring
knowing you are exactly where you need
to be
and exactly
where you intend to go
the sensation feels warm
it feels just right
there is a sense of building gratitude
for your discovery today
this discovery is felt
as a
smile throughout your entire body
take a moment to bask in this uplifting
energy
feel that you are embraced
by the warmth
and love
you have created for yourself
in this moment
[Music]
now let your attention gently arrive
back
into your body
and the space it is occupying
notice the felt sense of the room you
are in
acknowledge that something memorable
has just taken place in this space
you can build on this going forward
by connecting to this moment
where you have created a shift
you will remember this moment
in times when it is needed to lean on
this moment represents
a pivot
in your course
rest your attention on your breath now
[Music]
you have had time to completely
relax
[Music]
so your body and breath
feel
easy
now
you have been truly nourished by your
practice
and your mind
your mind has been inspired
by your imagination
[Music]
if you can dream it
you can create it
you have instilled a sense of confidence
in your future
begin to deepen your inhale with
intention
[Music]
use your inhale to energize your systems
and come out of this experience
ready to move forward with your day
you are alive and clear-headed
equipped with your share of the
universe's
infinite energy
when you are ready open your eyes as you
come into full awareness
ready for this new year
or new chapter to unfold
i am honored to have been your guide
today
repetition and consistency
are important for creating the life you
desire
so repeat this practice
often
i hope you have an easy and fulfilling
day
