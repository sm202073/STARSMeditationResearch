thank you for your interest in the
mindful movements guided visualization
to design your dream life i am sarah
raymond and i will be your guide today
are you living the life of your dreams
are you happy with your life
and the direction you are going my guess
is not entirely or you wouldn't be here
or maybe you are happy but you just want
more for your life maybe you feel like
something is missing or you're ready for
a change whatever your reason I am glad
you found your way to this visualization
and exercise
lao-tzu once said if you do not change
the direction you may end up where you
are heading
before we believe the life of our dreams
is possible we first must have an idea
of what it looks like today's practice
is a guided visualization to help you
design a life that you love and take the
steps to fulfillment and satisfaction
this practice will give you an
opportunity to design your dream life
and clarify your values you will begin
to develop positive habits and live
intentionally and you can connect with
your authentic self and let go of
resistance
let's start now with this guided
visualization find a comfortable place
where you won't be disturbed for the
next half hour or so open your mind and
your heart to the possibilities of a
life of your dreams we will begin by
letting go of tension and holding in our
physical body so we can let go of
holding on to expectations judgements or
being attached to specific outcomes in
our mind when your body is relaxed there
is space for possibilities to arise
you can more easily connect with your
authentic self I invite you to make
yourself comfortable making any subtle
adjustments to your body to soften
close your eyes
and bring your awareness
- the automatic process of your breath
while noticing your breath
begin to look inside yourself for
anywhere you can let go of the tendency
to hold on
let the weight of gravity sink into your
body to deepen your relaxation
give in to the support beneath you allow
relaxation into your body and peace into
your mind once you are calm you can
connect to your heart
and invite the version of your wisest
and truest self to come to the surface
[Music]
as your truest self surfaces I will
guide you to relax even more deeply
begin to breathe intentionally more
fully and count your breath
[Music]
your inhale is one and your exhale is
two counting up to 10 and then back down
again stay with your breath count and
allow your mind to begin to calm
[Music]
[Music]
allow your breath to relax to its
natural rhythm and let go of the
counting with a relaxed awareness look
for any areas of your body you can relax
from the inside
are there any places within you that you
can soften
[Music]
since the soles of your feet release as
well as your toes the tops of your feet
and ankles
allow this release to move up to your
calves your knees your thighs
and your hips
[Music]
continue to soften your stomach your
back your chest and your arms
welcome this relaxation to linger and
extend at the area of your throat and
neck as well as over your entire face
[Music]
your jaw and your scalp to feel complete
ease in your body
[Music]
look for relaxation without the need to
control
allow ease to move over your body when
it comes in its own time so it's not
forced
[Music]
as you become relaxed I will guide you
through a visualization
this practice is not about perfection
things may not feel aligned with the
life of your dreams right now and that's
okay
[Music]
simply work with what you have
and begin to move towards what you want
as you imagine this ideal life you may
see vivid pictures in your mind or you
may find emotions arising within you
perhaps you have specific answers to
some of the questions or they may come
later connect with everything that is
coming up for you today and open your
awareness to possibilities as they arise
in the future now in your imagination
begin to visualize your ideal life see
with as much detail as is available to
you
[Music]
how does this future life look
[Music]
what are you doing
what are you feeling in this ideal life
[Music]
who are you spending your time with
if you could not fail what would your
ideal self look like
[Music]
see what your typical day would look
like in your dream life in vivid detail
[Music]
[Music]
what feelings and emotions do you want
to have more of in your life
what are the values and beliefs that are
important to you
[Music]
visualize both the outcome and the
process to get there without getting
attached to either
all it takes is a thought to make a
change you can change your life the
moment you decide to change you choose
to live life how you choose to live life
you are not the sum of your
circumstances you are the sum of your
choices choose to live in alignment with
what is truly important to you
[Music]
these feelings from your dream life are
already within you you can choose to
call upon the feelings anytime you can
create any life you want your dreams are
within your grasp when you choose to
reach connect with what is showing up
for you now breathe that in
as you connect with your authentic self
the self that is deep within you you can
make choices that will align your life
with what's most important to you when
you intentionally choose more of what
feels good
and less of what doesn't situations and
life events will feel right and offer
more joy
you'll experience a sense of flow in
your life you might have a sense of
profound clarity
stay with this visualization of your
dream life a little longer
connect with your authentic self and any
feelings that may be coming up for you
now
[Music]
[Music]
and now bring your awareness back to the
surface and since the room around you
once more invite in a deep cleansing
breath filling up with the possibilities
of new and breathe out fully letting go
of old habits and negative beliefs take
a moment to honor yourself and the time
you have spent here today as the first
step in the creation of the life of your
dreams
know that aligning your life and your
decisions with your authentic self is a
big part of creating the life of your
dreams when your life is aligned with
who you are deep down inside you let go
of resistance and invite in the ease and
flow of life's energy this alignment
brings a clear purpose and fulfillment
to your life commit to reconnect to your
needs and desires make decisions aligned
with your values and this will design
your dream life choose to nourish what
feels good to you
