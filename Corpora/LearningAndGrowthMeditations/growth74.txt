allow yourself a moment to find a
peaceful
and comfortable spot where you'll not be
disturbed
rest your feet on the ground and just
pause the moment
close your eyes breathe in deeply
through your nose
for the count of three really filling up
your tummy like a balloon
[Music]
pause for a second or two and then
exhale deeply
all the way out until there's no air
left to release
continue taking these nice long deep
breaths
and notice how your whole body becomes
relaxed
[Music]
the more you focus on your breathing
slowly and purposefully the more your
whole body begins to sag with relaxation
and you can just feel all the tension
begin to melt away
as you relax 10 times more deeply
with every out breath
just focus on your breath allow yourself
to release
all of the stress and heaviness from
your body
you can feel yourself getting lighter
and brighter
already as you release all of the day's
demands
[Music]
now begin instructing your body to relax
even more deeply
beginning with the eyes say to yourself
in your mind
i am relaxing my eyes say to yourself
i am relaxing my cheeks and mouth
i am relaxing my neck and jaw
i'm relaxing my shoulders and chest
i'm relaxing my arms all the way
to the tips of my fingers
i'm relaxing my hips and my tummy
i'm relaxing my legs all the way to the
tips of my toes
just begin again from the eyes i'm
relaxing my eyes
just continue sending these instructions
to your body
[Music]
i'm relaxing my shoulders and chest
i'm relaxing through my arms and fingers
that's right just keep telling each part
of your body to relax
and when you arrive at your toes again
just allow yourself to imagine you have
big strong roots growing from beneath
your feet
like the roots of a tree
and these roots go down all the way into
the earth
moving through every layer of the
earth's crust
just follow their path as every root
and tendril reaches down towards the
earth's center
where there is light
just intend now that your roots anchor
themselves deeply here in mother earth's
belly
imagine them sinking deeply into the
earth's light
and as your roots begin to soak up this
grounding earth energy
you can notice a feeling of perfect
comfort and stillness
overwhelm you now
just take a moment to appreciate how
good that feels
as you fill yourself up with this
grounding earth energy
you can become aware now of the glowing
white light above your head
feeling the warmth of it upon your skin
the gentle whisper of it against your
cheek
the tingle in your crown as this light
begins to flow into you
filling you up with pure unconditional
love
and light allow yourself to become aware
of this channel of light that passes
through you now
connecting you to love from above
and below intend that this energy is
centered
and aligned within you
feel into your heart space to find that
point of center
and as you do just take a moment to feel
all of the sensations that arise from
being perfectly aligned
[Music]
feelings of perfect peace trust and
contentment
allow all of this light to move in and
around you
to form a perfect sphere or bubble
around yourself
and seal this bubble now with a layer of
gold or silver
creating a firm shield of protection for
yourself
and say to yourself in your mind
i am safe i am protected
i am love i am
love say those words over
and over again i am love
i am love the more you repeat these
words the more you can notice the energy
around you begin to buzz and charge
as you raise the vibration of your own
heart and field
just sink deeply into that delicious
feeling of love
safety comfort and peace
send a big beautiful thanks out to the
universe and beyond
for all of the love and all of the
protection
extended to you in this moment
[Music]
now imagine that you are stood at the
top of a mountain
breathe in deeply count to three in your
mind
the air is crisp and fresh
the view all around you so beautiful it
brings tears to your eyes
count to ten now slowly in your mind
allowing your consciousness to fully
integrate itself into this new place
feeling into this space with all of your
senses
pay attention to the sky beautiful and
shifting
swirls of color leading your eye to a
twinkling in the distance
and you can notice a feeling of curious
anticipation
and excitement as you feel yourself
being pulled
towards it just allow yourself to relax
and move gently
gently floating and gently bobbing along
just relaxing and feeling so light
and so bright and as the twinkling comes
into focus
you can see a grand staircase leading
towards a swirling vortex of light
just be still now
allow yourself to tune in to all the
subtle sensations and changes
that happen within you and around you
as you move closer towards this high
vibrational gateway
as you prepare for the dimensional shift
through the doorways of the heart of the
universe
your light body begins to activate
itself
the merkaba field of mother earth
amplified through this cosmic portal of
light
begins to come sharply into focus
and you can become aware now of the two
pyramid grids that surround you
one upright and one inverted
together forming a perfect star
and as you are drawn closer and closer
towards the portal
your field begins to tremble and buzz
you may feel a gentle tingle or hum
against your skin
just stay centered and still as you
continue
floating towards the portal of light
you can see the staircase now in perfect
detail
allow your memory to open up to receive
all of this experience
as you land gently at the foot of the
staircase
[Music]
allow yourself to begin climbing the
stairs towards the portal
offering the flow of unconditional love
in your heart
and asking out loud in your mind for
initiation into the light
[Music]
allow yourself to be magnetized to the
portal
feeling a gentle pull towards it as your
vibrational
frequency increases and as you enter the
portal
an explosion of euphoric love within you
as the frequency of twelve twelve
resonates within you
and your mercarbic field is activated
take a moment to enjoy how good it feels
to return to unity consciousness
[Music]
your heart and mind clear and bright
with a renewed sense of purpose and joy
the merkabah is a vehicle for your
ascension
as a light being in human form

tetrahedron
is now being activated around you by the
codes contained within the portal

powerfully shining starry shield of
light
that holds the resonance of your soul's
divine blueprint

completed on the solstice
