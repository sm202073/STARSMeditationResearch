hello and welcome to your guided
meditation on developing your growth
mindset
[Music]
now let's get started
find a comfortable seated position with
your back straight and your feet planted
on the ground
take a deep breath through your nose
feeling your lungs completely
and as you exhale through your mouth let
go any tension your body's holding
bring your attention to your breath
noticing any sensation of air flowing in
and out of your body
[Music]
repeat this deep slow breathing for a
few more rounds
allowing yourself to relax and sink
deeper into the present moment

now bring your mind to the idea of a
growth mindset

improved over time
little by little

notice any thoughts or beliefs that may
contradict this idea

at math
