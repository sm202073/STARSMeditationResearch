allow yourself to get into whatever
position feels best to you
when you're ready lovingly close your
eyes
allow your awareness to begin to drift
inwards
as you start to tune into your inner
landscape
[Music]
tuning in to the flow of air entering
and exiting as you breathe
[Music]
feeling how it moves through you
[Music]
paying attention to what muscles you
engage as you breathe
letting the breath be natural and easy
nothing you need to control or Force
in this moment you simply allow the air
to flow freely
[Music]
also allow yourself to release and relax
any muscles you do not need to use right
now
as best as you can
letting yourself off the hook if this is
not easy to do
[Music]
and if thoughts come and go as they do
that's okay
just invite your awareness to return to
your breath
and the words you are hearing
[Music]
[Music]
begin to allow your imagination to show
you a beautiful ocean beach
white shimmering Sands as far as you can
see from left to right
and Crystal Clear Blue Water ahead of
you all the way out to the horizon
[Music]
you may feel the warmth on the soles of
your feet
and the sun beaming down upon your
shoulders
[Music]
as you breathe in a fresh Breeze off the
ocean Coast
invite yourself to be fully immersed in
this scene
feeling the fresh air
feeling the freedom
and you bring your body just to the edge
of the water
crouching down
[Music]
watching the water just barely tickle
your toes and then recede back into the
ocean
[Music]
you may feel called to imagine you are
placing your hands in the water
[Music]
feeling the coolness and the freshness
that is here for you
[Music]
and you begin to notice that to your
right
is a large glowing light
and as you look more closely it appears
to be a pink net made out of pink light
you have this urge to cast it into the
water
and so
you lift up the net
and you throw it out wide into the ocean
[Music]
you see this pink light shimmering in
the water
and notice that
as you begin to pull the net in
you discover it has captured hundreds if
not thousands of glowing orbs of light
all making their way to you
as you pull the net in
you pause for a moment as they're all
gathered up and floating in the water
and you just stay connected to your
breath as you look at this imagery
you are reminded In This Moment
how many resources are right there at
your fingertips
[Music]
it's all there for you
energetically
it's already there
everything you desire
it's all a matter of bumping up with it
now
and as you see these orbs of brilliant
light
and as you feel your own immeasurable
manifesting power
[Music]
your own connection
to the all that is
to love and to source
you suddenly get an urge
to set all of those orbs of energy free
and even
to set the net free
casting it out letting it flow where it
may
[Music]
letting everything be as it is
[Music]
and as you do this you watch the net
disintegrate
into a beautiful brilliant pink light
that flows freely throughout the ocean
and you yourself feel so free you lie
down on the sand
smiling how good this feels
and in this sense of freedom
many of the brilliant orbs of light in
the ocean begin to lift up
on their own accord
and come to you now
[Music]
bringing you gifts a loving energy
that they release all over you
trust how your imagination senses and
experiences this
[Music]
you cannot stop that which is meant to
be yours
for the highest good
you cannot stop that from coming to you
foreign
[Music]
it is natural
you may relax in The Knowing of this
I will leave you for a few moments to do
just that
[Music]
[Music]
when you're ready to come out of this
really take your time to do so
[Music]
taking a moment to feel your body where
it is right now
feeling gravity
slowly rolling shoulders
wiggling fingers and toes
and as it feels good to you
open your eyes
back to the world around you
wonderful job today
