hello welcome
take a moment to settle in
relax as we begin a journey through time
your eyes and breathe
i am your guide we are traveling through time tonight
whatever time of day it is for you adjust and return when you are up to speed
and ready for a wonderful journey towards incredible peace solitude
and healing
i'm now going to count down from 10. each number we are becoming more
and more relaxed in our bodies and
awareness you should feel quite
lighter
ten
nine eight
seven six
[Music] five
for becoming more and
more relaxed
three
more relaxed bring awareness to your body too
going now to the most deepest relaxation we have felt
in meditation one
we are here now at the bottom of the relaxation scale
we will remain here until the meditation and guided journey
to atlantis has concluded
until that time remain grounded and relaxed
let's turn up that imagination now we are now ready to journey together
through time discovering many unique visits and sites
along our way
i want to take a moment now and thank you for joining us along this journey
together in a journey of discovery and healing my dear friend and soul
the best journeys are accompanied by friends and guides
we cannot do it all on our own we are all helping each other along the
way and you will soon find that even you
begin turning into a guide yourself towards the ending of this journey which is really
just a new beginning
now that we are on this lower level one of the relaxation scale
we are now tuning our minds and our imagination directed towards this enlightened
healing journey
imagine now a time portal in a room
this time machine is eternal and has the ability to take you
anywhere you choose
this time machine will always be with you wherever you go
you'll be able to see it but no one around you will as
it remains in multiple dimensions at once
we use a cloaking mechanism for this beautiful time machine so
fear not gather some thoughts now on where you'd
like to go stirring up this imaginative
real reality
i am your guide so i will direct us appropriately the goal here
is to find the palace and ruin of healing
i've heard this place of healing is located in the city of atlantis where
anything is possible
let's choose to go there now
i've routed the time machine for ancient atlantis
step in to the time machine now the door is closing and our
opportunities fading [Music]
you'll notice the inside of this time machine is very pressure sensitive so as the
pressures begin to change don't worry about that it's normal
strange visuals and sounds now accompany your presence
you visually see what the travel portal wants to reveal before your arrival
awesome we have landed [Music] the door opens now step
[Music] out [Music]
now this is the real deal this is what we call the wonderful ancient
atlantis [Music]
so [Music]
a true sight now isn't it
walk along with me in this place the people have fully
harnessed the limits of mind bending them and allowing the
imagination to run a little wild
in good ways mostly
the ancient temple i heard is 1 000 years old
foreign species and cultures have harnessed the inner powers inside
for centuries the cool part is we are allowed
in due to the unlimited tethers of parallel dimensional
realities made possible by the inventors of this time portal
we can go anywhere and honestly do anything we want
we just need to get you healed though as it is my mission to keep this journey
moving along steadily as we walk past these rather strange
enlarged monuments notice the changes in color
these are vibrations that have been intersecting with foreign frequencies
view this as a intersection of crossroads but rather energetically they
are alive actually living
it is said that at the intersecting point here it has a higher intelligence than the
combined universe this energy its multiple energies they
notice all and see all
but no worries we are allowed here if we weren't our time portal would have
collapsed us into deep space
[Music] yeah notice those animals
quite rare you see lions with foxes half human half rhino
here in atlantis they have experimented with crossbreeding
anyways that's for a later conversation it ended up getting them into some
trouble with the planetary councils
until now no culture has lasted this long with such ability
here you are healed instantly these rooms and towers actually
accelerate learning ever see the movie the matrix
it's like that but much faster and expanded
that person over there they just spent 1 000 years on the solar planet
necronian learning how to capture time continuums in order
to spawn new suns in our multiple different galaxies
sounds like a walk in the park right but she was actually present the whole
time these portals are like contracts
if you begin one you are lawfully tied to remaining there
only the most experienced souls enter these types of contracts
all right enough scaring you let's see here there is the ruin
of all energetic healing doesn't look like much that's because
it is cloaked to look like a simple cave in reality this is a portal to endless
possibility and potential power
it is said to hold all of the knowledge of the great creation and beyond
this is where it is said that life first began
shall we let us go come through
this dark room holds all the answers imaginable
any answer i know it's rather cold in here but they'll take really good care of us
every inch of this underworld is lined with unique malleable
consciousness
in terms we understand that thought creates and spawns whatever you like
it out imagine whatever you wish
[Music]
all right come on here we enter the forbidden staircase
it's called that because many foreign rulers and energies have tried entering without
rite of passage those souls are said to be held within
small pebbles around the walls and floor everything has life here
and i mean everything just watch your step it sees you
and i and it knows all possible outcomes anything we think it knew prior to us
thinking so just be aware
there it is the pool and fountain of all healing
quite large and bright it is lined with intelligence far beyond our
capacity to understand i will never try at least
as a guide this is where i stop wander this place for a moment and
i'll still be here but only my voice now you are in a different dimension than i
just watch the pools beside you very intelligent they are
[Music]
[Music]
yeah over there step up on those stairs leading to the circle of healing
don't yet step onto the water
also don't worry about the colorful magnets or lights spinning overhead
[Music]
the washing process as they call it will erase all past resentments and karma
from your energy [Music]
it has to do with frequencies basically it frees you to do more with
your life often souls come here
if they can no longer progress through time they live in constant fear remember
it's your intention that manifests here nothing else
the power can only do what you allow it to
all right that's the signal those lights
do this now step into and under the open shower head
clean water is now rinsing you from head to toe
cleaning any and all debris and baggage of self-imposed
limitations this rinses you clean of all impurities
of bodily illnesses fears doubts and
disbeliefs
all worries it carries them all away
quite the sensations aren't they [Music] oh i've been here more than a few times
it's why i help people like you
it's fully rinsing every inch of you
from all pain and sorrows
any stuck energy is now released by this purification
definitely effective [Music]
that shower stopping is normal that means that you have washed away all the impurities within
yourself
there you now stand there you are my lovely soul friend
walk with me now over here back to the time portal
i know it's a little hard to see we're actually in here already walk a little further
time works a little bit different here that sight there that's your body
this meditation was a pleasure
truly revisit often i'll always be your guide and friend to help you solve life's
ongoing worries you wouldn't believe how many different
spirits and souls i see journeying here to find rest
well it's now time to go back and rest my dear one
take this adventure and new enlightening perspective and share it
i must now return to the other portals
i hear many beings calling
ciao
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you
