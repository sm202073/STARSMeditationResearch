begin by getting into a comfortable
position
whatever that looks like for you
and once you feel ready lovingly close
your eyes
[Music]
begin to tune your attention inwards
[Music]
focusing on your breath and your body
tuning in
to yourself tuning in to you
affirming i am here
i am me all is well
and now take a nice big breath in
stomach and rib cage
fully expanding holding your breath at
the top
and when you're ready exhale with a sigh
at the bottom of that breath repeat
stomach and rib cage fully expanding
holding your breath momentarily at the
top and when you're ready
exhale with a sigh
whenever you reach the bottom do this
one more time
really making it count feeling yourself
entering
into this moment releasing with a sigh
and then just returning to breathing at
a pace that feels
good to you
[Music]
you begin to feel more centered in your
body
more connected to this moment
the time is right for you to realize the
truth
you are love and you're capable of
creating a world of love around you
you control your future through your
heart
tune into this space in the middle of
your chest and a couple of inches
inwards
feel the energy here expanding
until it creates a sphere of heart light
around you
[Music]
take a moment feeling into this
connect to your own heart's vibration
it is all love powerful and wise
as you connect to this feeling
you recognize there's nothing you need
externally
the path to a bright future begins
within
through your heart
you see before you now several pathways
as if you're in the woods
facing many winding dirt trails
it's a very peaceful forest you feel the
sun
shining down on you and you are still
surrounded by your heart light
only love may enter in and only love may
exit out
you are connected to your heart's power
source
to your power source
the powerful energy of your heart
emanates from you
the more you become aware of it the more
you feel it
the more you tap into it the more you
recognize
it is deeply wise deeply knowing
and powerful
before we explore this forest tap in
more deeply
to this heart light that's around you
do you see a color or perhaps multiple
colors
does it shimmer is it prismatic
what do you notice
trust yourself
even if for now you just get an inkling
of a sensation that is enough
whatever you're experiencing right now
is perfect for you
and know that the more you do this the
stronger your connection becomes
spend just a couple more breaths
connecting to this
[Music]
the more connected you are the more you
know
it doesn't matter what path you take
they will all lead to love
for when you let love lead the way in
your heart
it automatically leads you to more love
this love is grounded secure and stable
it is not flighty nor fickle
it is steadfast
it is faithful to you
your heart light knows that you cannot
get it wrong
that you are always exactly where you're
meant to be
that you are a beacon of love
and therefore a magnet for more
experiences
and to feel loving joyous
freeing
as you tune into this knowing that you
can't get it wrong
and that it's safe to trust your heart
light
your inner guidance
your own energy and faith
that love is all around you love is
within you
from here the path you most want to take
lights up before you what color is the
path lighting up as
are there any fun woodland creatures any
cool plants down that path
trust what you sense see or feel
and begin to joyously begin down the
path
as you do your heart light expands
it grows throughout the forest lighting
up every path
[Music]
for indeed whatever path you walk on
with your heart light as your guide
will always be bright
the path you're on opens up into a wide
open field
you begin to feel yourself very much
like a small child
feeling free to play to enjoy yourself
you recall that feeling of what it was
like to be a child
carefree
[Music]
innocent
and you recognize you can be that way
now
you can trust in life
you can trust in your bright future
you are free to play and be yourself
surrounded by love guided by love
it's safe to be you now is the time
to let go
let go of external suggestions
of what you should do or be
and drop in to that child like you
with your beautiful heart light leading
the way
as you walk down any path your heart
guides you to take
as all paths that you follow from your
heart
will always lead to a bright future
indeed dear love your future is most
bright
take a deep breath into this knowing
hold your breath at the top
feel grateful to yourself for feeling
this and when you already exhale with a
sigh
[Music]
return to this anytime you need to
reconnect with your heart light
and that trusting knowing sensation
that you're on the right path and the
future in front of you
is indeed very bright
when you're ready come out of this by
slowly rolling your
shoulders wiggle your fingers and toes
and take your time as you slowly open
your eyes back to the world around you
we're so happy you're here
and we're so excited for your bright
future
have a wonderful rest of your day
