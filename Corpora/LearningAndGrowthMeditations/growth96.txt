hello and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to
cultivate a positive mindset before sleep and one that will empower you in
the days to come my name is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to open your
mind and soften your heart as you prepare for this journey just to begin
finding a comfortable resting position that will be conducive of sleep and
support yourself with any blankets and cushions you might need and close your
eyes as you settle in
ensure that your neck is aligned with your spine and let your limbs surrender
into the surface beneath you
and I invite your mind to fully arrive in this moment by tuning into your
physical body and just note what it feels like to be in your body and to be
supported by this place that holds you now
drawing your attention to your breath minding the unconscious stream of life
force that continually flows through you
in order to breathe there is nothing you need to actively do the breath is guided
by an innate consciousness that supports the life in all of us so simply observe
it simply pay attention to its effortless presence watch the way it
flows in and watch the way it flows out
if at any point during this meditation you notice the mind has drifted into
unrelated thoughts simply guided back towards the words spoken here or to the
anchor that is your breath now before we move into a visualization to cultivate
positivity before sleep let's take some time to harness the power of the breath
because even though we do not need to control or engage the breath in any way
in order for it to function we can consciously direct the breath in various
ways to support deeper healing for instance as we mindfully invite the
breath into the belly we initiate the body's relaxation response and interfere
with the fired flight freeze response that can chronically take over our lives
we can also use the breath to consciously cleanse ourselves of any negative thoughts or beliefs that impede
with the experience of vitality and empowerment to practice this just take a
couple more natural mindful breaths at your own pace
and after your next exhalation I invite you to imagine that as you inhale you
take in a bright white light from the universe that surrounds you and as you
exhale imagine any mental or emotional debris leaving your body inhale the
white healing light of the universe and
exhale any heavy stagnant or negative energy that may be holding you back from
being or that you are
continue breathing in this way for a little longer and as you do I invite you
to be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout this process we are
all subject to experiencing negative or limiting thoughts and feelings so if it
feels that negative energy has been culminating in you recently know that
this is nothing personal and in fact it is nothing bad or wrong rather when we
become aware that we have been holding on to negative or self-limiting energy
we are blessed with the opportunity to move beyond it awareness of negative
energy in this way acts as a catalyst for deep transformation
so take just three more for cleansing breaths now inhaling light and exhaling
any heaviness or darkness
and after you finish that third exhalation let your breath come back to
its natural pace depth and rhythm
having established a groundwork of inner light and positivity let's begin our
journey into a visualization of positive transformation so take a moment to draw
your attention to the mind's eye honoring this space within you for its
incredible capacity for visualization
clear away any images or ideas that might be held here and on the empty
canvas left behind I invite you to imagine that you are standing in a
wintry forest somewhere not far from the outer reaches of the Arctic Circle
the sky is dark and a deep silence permeates the forest snow covers the
ground and though it is cold out you are
well bundled and prepared for this journey standing with your feet firmly
rooted into the snow packed trail beneath you you stand tall and take a
deep full breath into your belly and
they let it back out another long deep breath into the belly
and then back out and you take a third
and final breath in of this crisp clean pine infused air and let it all go with
a sigh
you begin now your journey on the path ahead you tread slowly and mindfully
open to the wonder of this remarkable midnight landscape
as you walk through this quiet uninhabited land you feel a sense of the
infinite possibilities of the universe stars and the moon that shined down on
you from up above remind you of the magic and mystery of the cosmos the
cosmos that you are an integral part of all of the world's challenges and your
own challenges seem to fall from your shoulders as you make your way through
this vast and natural landscape it may
not be that the difficulties go away completely however your fear and
resistance to these challenges diminishes with each step you take
across the forest floor
in their place confidence courage and a
positive outlook on life arises
you continue to weave through the pines and spruce trees though it is quite dark
your eyes are well adjusted thanks to the help of the glowing full moon above
you are not quite sure how or why you've arrived at this place
but you sense that you were being called to take a step back from the gritty
details of life and to consider yourself your life and the universe from a fresh
perspective
here in this near Arctic forest you find space to breathe and indeed you begin to
develop a clearer broader view of things a leap away from the day-to-day routines
and habitual modes of thinking the weight of the world you've been carrying
dissolves here in this forest you feel
yourself awakening to your divine presence and to the divinity that lives
within all beings and within the earth itself
you breathe deeper now letting each breath continue to cleanse any negative
thoughts or beliefs that no longer serve you
as you walk a little further through this enchanted landscape you begin to
absorb all of its wonder beauty and blessings you take in the freshness of
the snow that covers the earth and the treetops you relish in the sound of this
snow crunching beneath your feet and you
sink into the silence that pervades the entire forest absorbing the herbal aroma
of the pine and spruce trees
your mind is awakening to all of the details of this landscape and to the
beauty in the simplest of things
soon you arrived at the edge of the forest coming upon a small clearing in
the land the small field is covered in snow and at the opposite end of it a
cabin awaits you slowly you cross the
field paying attention to the crunching snow of each step
and as you arrive at this humble abode you discover a small fire pit just
outside the front door that is cleared prepped and ready to be
lit
in the small shed just a few meters away from the fire pit you discover a small
brass matchbox holder as well as a warm knitted blanket you grab both and head
back towards the edge of the pit
kneeling down beneath the starry sky you strike a match and set the bundle of
twigs on fire you watch as the flame slowly consume these thin branches and
then you place two logs atop the burning pile
you wrap yourself in the warm blanket and then sink back into the wooden
armchair in front of the fire
[Music] the crackling flames pierced the silent
night with grace you welcome the noise as it settles the soul and awakens the
heart
and as you rest here gazing into the amber glow of flames and coal you sense
the possibility of transformation that rests before you this element you gaze
into is the holder of new life bearing the capacity to alkalize parts of you
that are ready for change fire ignites
our personal power and calls us to new beginnings and so hearing its call you
offer to this fire any negative thoughts stories or beliefs that hold you back
from moving positively and courageously into the future
you might consider beliefs that hold you back from experiencing positive loving
relationships or you might consider those that hold you back from success
and achieving your wildest dreams
or you might reflect upon the negative thought patterns that hold you back from
cultivating your greatest capacity the spiritual emotional and physical
well-being whatever arises you offer to
the fire what no longer serves you casting those limiting negative thoughts
into the fire to be transformed
when nothing else is left to be released you let yourself bask in the fire's warm
glow your belly softens your shoulders
relax and you compassionately witness whatever is now moving through you
sometimes clearing out space for a more positive mindset feels exhilarating and
empowering sometimes this process creates momentary confusion sadness or
other challenging emotions whatever is present for you honor your experience by
tending to it with patience and compassion just allow these waves to
come and go it and flow
you lean your head back against the upper surface of the chairs backrest and
as you shift your gaze away from the fire and into the night sky it appears
the radiant glowing alchemical Northern
Lights neon green indigo and fuchsia
bursts of light dance in the cosmos above you watching them play in the
night sky you feel an immense wave of
gratitude washed through you as well as a sense of magic and infinite
possibility
you realize that the world is much more than it seems and that even when things
are dark there are always traces of light to be found from the fires glow to
the stars and the moon to the radiance of the Northern Lights positivity is
reflected back to you from all directions the openness confidence faith
and trust that lives deep within you
[Music] spend a few more moments here now watching the play of the light in the
sky above these rays of neon light sweep
the sky with grace joy and ease
awakening you to those qualities as they appear within you
in this moment held in the beauty of the natural world you realize that this life
is a gift and that in each moment there
is something wondrous to discover
[Music]
the light continues to dance in the atmosphere that surrounds you and yet
you let your eyes land once again on the burning fire you come back to your
breath back to your body and back to
your heart
and to help reaffirm what you've discovered here you take a moment to set
an intention to live your life courageously confidently and with faith
allowing positivity to guide your way
now take a few final moments to bask in the beauty of this landscape and when
you are ready take three long deep breaths as you let the imagery dissolve
slowly return to the reality that holds you by minding your body and your breath
[Music]
note the surface that supports you and the air that nourishes you
and let your body surrender to this transformative night and as you do allow
the following affirmations to permeate your being as they enter your
subconscious mind they will continue to ground your being in the positivity you
