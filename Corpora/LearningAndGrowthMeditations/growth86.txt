begin by getting into a comfortable
position
whatever that looks like for you
whenever you're ready
lovingly close your beautiful eyes
and begin to allow your awareness to
drift inwards
tuning into breath
and body
identifying a sense of flow
in your breath
and a sense of stillness in your body
feeling that both are possible
in this moment
in each moment
in all moments
feeling that neither one is
good or bad
better than or less than
feeling how flow and stillness go hand
in hand
even if only for this moment
finding and identifying the stillness in
your body
and
the flow in your breath
perhaps feeling how they work together
the flow of the breath
makes the stillness possible
or rather it makes the awareness of the
stillness possible
for without the breath
there goes the awareness
feel within you a marriage of stillness
and flow
a sense of understanding
a marriage between
both being
and
becoming
for what you already are
is simultaneously
becoming
we will be
there is both a stillness and
a flow
let your awareness now drop down into
your heart's energy center
in the middle of your chest and a couple
of inches inwards
finding the space
resting
in a sense of
solace
within this space
a sense of peace
and stillness
a sense of hope
and openness
within your heart you feel a curiosity
a pulling
a longing
for the heart to be wide open
open to receive
love
joy
happiness
fulfillment
success on the hearts terms
as you rest into this feeling
you begin to imagine that all around you
is a piece of high tech
here
it appears to be a solid sphere
see yourself inside of this almost as if
it is a high-tech vehicle
you may use your imagination to envision
it as something from the future
a perfect sphere
that fits you perfectly
build yourself with your mind's eye a
comfortable chair
a giant window with a grand view
[Music]
what else is in this piece of high tech
gear
this high tech vehicle
trust your imagination
and find before you now a lever
and as you push it forward
feel this
ship this vehicle you've built
rising
moving forward and up
trust your path
see yourself lifting above the tree line
seeing now your entire country
seeing now your entire continent
exiting the earth's atmosphere and now
seeing the entire earth
let yourself zoom to a spot in the
universe that feels just right for you
trusting your imagination and where it
brings you now
what is your view
what do you see
and perhaps more importantly
what do you feel
out here in this vastness of space
let your imagination sense
that there is
love
it's not
empty space
it is love
you may imagine what appears to be
space
is actually full of and teeming with
life
in a non-physical non-visible way
this is more a job for the imagination
and the heart than it is for logic
you may sense perhaps
a glittering in the air
a light emanating
or maybe nothing at all
but just a feeling of love
a feeling
of life force energy
and you feel a pull within your heart to
receive this love
to support you in both your stillness
and your flow
in both your being
and your becoming
tune in to how you feel you know within
you
that this loving energy this life force
will assist you in both aspects
of being and
becoming
stillness
and flow
and when you're ready you find a big
bold button inside of your machine
and you have an intuitive knowing that
when you press it
doors will open
and love will come flooding in
when you feel ready
take a deep breath in
and on your exhale press the button
feel the doors of this spherical vehicle
opening wide
and on your next inhale feel yourself
receiving the love from the universe
the love that's all around you feel it
flowing into your heart
into every cell of your being
and as you exhale feel it flowing
throughout you
settling in
imagining that the breathing in is the
flow is the becoming
and the breathing out is the stillness
the being
[Music]
sensing love entering into both of these
aspects of your life
and as you tune into your hearts energy
center
you discover that just as you've opened
the doors of this vehicle so too
have you opened metaphorical doors in
your heart
feel and tune into an openness in your
heart
a receptivity to love
a receptivity
to compassion
to self-forgiveness acceptance and
understanding
affirm to yourself
i am here
i am me
i am love
and with that
the vehicle quickly closes its doors
teleports you back to where you are
right now
you feel yourself in this present time
and space
perhaps moving your sit bones from side
to side to really feel yourself angered
down
and you tune in to how your body heart
and mind feels right now
there is an increased flow of love
and receptivity towards love
towards compassion
how in both aspects of your being and
your becoming
there is love
if you feel cold you may place both your
hands on your heart
as you say thank you
thank you
thank you
carry this feeling with you as you
really take your time
and you slowly begin
to roll your shoulders
wiggle your fingers
and your toes
and
when you're ready
[Music]
gently
open your eyes back to the world around
you
wonderful job today
we so appreciate you being here
you
