welcome to this meditation for spiritual
development
i'm so happy you're here you're in the
right place
let yourself get into a nice comfortable
position
whatever that looks like for you
place your hands on your heart and
lovingly close your eyes
[Music]
as you tune into your breath you also
direct your attention to the space in
the middle of your chest
and a couple of inches inwards
your hearts energy center
spend a moment settling into your body
connecting to your breath and that
beautiful heart of yours
that heart of yours is more than just
the physical
and you feel a deep and annoying within
you right now of that truth
within your heart the core of your being
[Music]
you may access the eternal
limitless formless
being
[Music]
we really are
[Music]
tap into this non-physical form of you
that's all-knowing all powerful
how loving
and if it helps you sense a name
for this non-physical form of yours
if not you can just call it me
trust whatever feels right to you
you may let your hands drop down to your
sides if that feels good to you
or keep them on your heart whatever
feels best
either way the goal now is to set the
intention
to truly connect deeply
[Music]
completely as completely as possible
to that non-physical form of you
you may begin to sense energy vibrating
around and within you
you may begin to see patterns of waves
and light
trust whatever is happening to you
whatever's happening
with you from you
as you tap into the deeper truth of who
you are
you spend a few breaths relaxing into
this connection
feeling yourself merging
[Music]
becoming one
and now as you feel this oneness with
your source
it's as if you are floating on
a raft down a smooth flowing river
you may feel the sun shining on your
face as if your hands are behind your
head
and you get this sense that you trust
in the unfolding of life
that you know you are on the right path
of your spiritual development
but you're in good hands with your soul
you can let go and enjoy the peaceful
ride
you say to yourself i trust in my
soul
tune into how that feels
there's no need for you to use oars or
paddles on this raft
you feel it's flowing in divine timing
[Music]
it's navigating the waters perfectly
[Music]
so too are you through your physical
form
navigating your physical life
through your connection to the
non-physical greater aspect of you
you let go of attachment to outcome
[Music]
you let your connection to your heart
and that deep eternal
all-knowing aspect of you
you let that be enough right now
[Music]
letting go of everything else
you make all that matters in this moment
your connection to the divine
your connection to you as a divine being
you may feel deep gratitude for this
[Music]
you feel the love of your eternal
being wrapping around you flowing
through you
you feel a deep power within you that's
all loving
all wise
and you feel deep acceptance
accepting yourself fully as you are
where you are
and you know for whatever reason it's
perfect right now
you are perfect
you're on your own perfect path
of spiritual development and perfect
timing
perfect order
relax into this truth
you open up and ask yourself
that eternal you
what will you have me know about my own
spiritual development
trust what you receive
[Music]
you are more powerful than you know but
in this moment you
start to acutely know
you start to really feel that power
it's divine it's
gentle natural
you are a creator of miracles
you are a miracle
carry this truth with you with deep
gratitude in your heart
knowing you're on the right path
your spiritual development is happening
all in perfect timing
[Music]
begin to really connect your physical
form
feeling gravity wiggling your fingers
and toes
rolling your shoulders
and taking your time as you open your
eyes
back to the beautiful world around you
wonderful job today
[Music]
you
