good morning and welcome to your
practice
i'm sarah raymond from the mindful
movement
and i am truly honored you have chosen
to allow me
to be your guide
this meditation is designed to empower
you
if you are feeling stuck overwhelmed
and anxious and if you are motivated for
change
yet feeling limited by your beliefs
today is a new day and a new opportunity
to gain clarity in a time of personal
growth
i invite you to make yourself
comfortable
choose a relaxed seated posture with
your spine
upright if possible
[Music]
perhaps on a cushion on the floor
a chair against a wall
or on a couch
close your eyes if you'd like
or simply soften your gaze
start to shift side to side gently
in your seat
feel the movement of your attention
from one side to another
move this shifting upward
to your waist
then see if you are able to move the
wiggle
up to your ribs
[Music]
and then shoulders
then maybe even a small movement side to
side
at the height of your neck
and then your head
take a deep breath in through your nose
then let out an audible sigh exhale
as you settle into stillness
become aware of the feels in your body
the sensations
perhaps you sense a buzzing
or tingling
as the energy from your movement
continues
yet your physical body becomes still
as if there is a momentum within you
that takes a few moments too slow
take another few deep breaths
at your own pace continuing
to settle
[Music]
inhale through your nose
and let out an audible exhale
a sigh or ha sound
or perhaps make a humming noise on your
exhale
[Music]
noise creates vibration in your throat
and it is effective to help you relax
and regulate your nervous system
[Music]
after a few cycles
let your breath return to its effortless
rhythm
invite a softening of your outer layer
to wash over you
perhaps you might imagine the removal of
armor put there to protect you
yet here you are safe
it is okay to let go of this armor
for a bit
or consider what it might feel like
to blur your edges
as if a camera lens is changing focus
you are still you
you are safe you are simply
letting go of the rough hard
edges
as you continue to relax and soften
in your mind visualize a doorway
or an entrance of sorts
this can be a doorway you have been to
before
or one that exists only in your mind
[Music]
this may show up as a memory
or as if it is a picture in your mind
[Music]
if nothing specific comes to mind
simply use the idea
of a door
this door represents your opportunity
to grow to move forward
to make the change in your life that you
desire
this is the metaphorical threshold
you may be having trouble crossing in
your own life
perhaps something related to business
a relationship
your home life
a creative endeavor
[Music]
as this image becomes clearer in your
mind
you can also see yourself in front of
this doorway
[Music]
as you witness yourself standing in
front of the door
that you know leads you to the next step
in your life
you see that you are holding many items
in both of your hands
it becomes clear that you cannot open
this door
unless you are willing to put some
things down
breathe slowly and continue
to relax and
connect with the feeling that you are
safe
these items you are holding represent
any and all beliefs
obstacles or responsibilities
that are holding you back
knowing that you must let go
[Music]
in order to open this door
consider what needs to be laid
down
breathe in and
exhale letting go
letting go letting go
as you let go
sense the weight being lifted
the lightness wash over you
consider these questions to help you
let go
what is no longer serving you
[Music]
what is standing in your way
is there a story you have been telling
yourself
that is holding you back from the change
you desire
the answers to these questions may show
up for you now
or sometime in the future
be open be
[Music]
curious
now is the time to let go of
anything that may be holding you back
from making a change you desire
[Music]
let go of any negative beliefs you may
have about yourself
visualize yourself putting down
the limiting beliefs so they can no
longer hold you back
and now consider what is a new belief
about yourself that would serve you
[Music]
better
you have put down any negative beliefs
or anything holding you back
you have freed your hands
to be able to open the door now
you have made room for new
positive powerful beliefs to surface
that will support you as you move
through this door
things may not feel aligned with the
life of your dreams right now
and that's okay
today you begin to move
towards what you want
[Music]
know that all you desire is available to
you
because you are absolutely good enough
you are worthy
you deserve love success
health financial freedom
and all that you desire
[Music]
hear these words again
[Music]
feel them in your heart as true
you are enough
you are worthy
you deserve all that you desire
[Music]
now that you have laid down what is
holding you back
you can open the door you can move
through the threshold into the next
phase the next step
see yourself moving through the doorway
and look back at all that you have laid
down
perhaps you recognize that now
you are open to receive new
clear thoughts and ideas about your path
[Music]
you are open to experience
clarity
you begin to notice how new ideas
begin to present themselves to you
and now let the visualization go
and bring your awareness back to your
felt
sensations once more
take a moment to ground yourself
after this visualization
and feel the weight of your body
a strong anchoring connection
with the surface below you
become rooted in this present moment
fully
allow your breath to create ease
in your body and
ease in your mind
to open to clarity
to show itself from within you
[Music]
as you breathe sense
the feeling of clarity
breathe in a state of calmness
and ease
the clarity you desire is within you
simply bring your focus inward
[Music]
cultivate simplicity
and focus of the mind
to experience clarity
may you move through the doorway with
ease
and experience all that you desire
while remaining grounded in presence
when you feel ready
open your eyes
if you feel called to do so
you can benefit from taking pen to paper
and writing about what came up for you
during this practice
for your reference as your writing i
have included the questions
from this meditation in the description
box below
thank you for practicing with me today i
hope you have a wonderful day
