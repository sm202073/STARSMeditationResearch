begin by letting yourself get into
whatever position feels best to you
[Music]
and when you're ready
softly close your beautiful eyes
and tune your awareness inwards
focusing on your breath
and your body
letting your belly be soft and loose if
it's not already
there's nothing to hold on to here
allow any muscles you do not need to use
right now
to become slack
and relaxed
feel how the air flows naturally in
and out
without you having to try
or do anything
your only role is to allow
your only role
is to allow
let the feeling behind that sentence
seep in
you only rule
is to allow
what do you wish to allow
love
joy
prosperity peace on the planet
whatever you wish to allow you must
first
line up with
feel within you
and then allow it to flow through you
allow it to fuel you
what do you wish to line up with today
identify the emotion you wish to feel
and generate it within you right now
you may surprise yourself at how easily
it begins to come
identify where you first feel it
perhaps to begin you had a thought come
to mind that gives you the feeling
you do not need to continue to think
about anything
but rather
continue to focus on the feeling
watch as the feeling grows
let your focus on this feeling be all
you need right now
and if your mind does wander that's
perfectly okay
simply return your focus to the feeling
again
over and over continually coming back to
how good this feels
with no other motive
than to give yourself the gift of
feeling this way now
isn't that enough
don't you deserve to
there need not be any other reason
any other motivation
than to give yourself the gift of lining
up with feeling good
watch now as the feeling continues to
grow
[Music]
perhaps thoughts of affirmation start to
trickle in
if this happens allow
only redirect if the thoughts seem to
drift from the feeling you're
experiencing
to refocus on the feeling
otherwise you may notice thoughts begin
to pop up that line up with the feeling
that perhaps even enhance the feeling
allow those
revel in those
enjoy the feelings
i will leave you alone now for a few
minutes
to continue to practice this
and enjoy this
trust and know whatever you experience
is right for you
and you can only get it right
enjoy
[Music]
[Music]

now
begin to imagine that this feeling is
concentrated
in the center of your chest and a couple
of inches inwards
imagining it living within a beautiful
egg
within your heart
you may see this egg as golden
or white
or perhaps some other color or pattern
trust what you see
notice its size
and feel how it perfectly contains these
feelings
seeing them as concentrated in this
space
now
imagine a column of light extending from
as high as you can imagine
down through your head
out through the soles of your feet
and into the core of the earth
imagine now that the egg within your
heart begins to lift up through this
column of light
and it hovers about one foot above your
head
and splits open
from it extends
all of the energy that you just felt
[Music]
and it flows out like an umbrella around
you
sealing you in
creating another egg but this time all
around your body
[Music]
sealing you into this feeling completely
you will carry these emotions with you
in your heart today everywhere you go
carry this feeling with you
as you begin to roll your shoulders
wiggle your fingers and toes
and when you're ready
open your eyes back to the world around
you
you
