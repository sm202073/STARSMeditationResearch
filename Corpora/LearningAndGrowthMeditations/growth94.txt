begin by getting into a comfortable
position
whenever you're ready
softly close your eyes
[Music]
and turn your awareness inwards
[Music]
focusing your awareness on your breath
[Music]
and your body
tuning into the weight of gravity
[Music]
feeling the points of contact between
you and the surface on which you are
resting
[Music]
exploring what it feels like as you
breathe
just let your breath be soft and natural
all throughout the course of this
practice
[Music]
as you allow yourself to feel more
present in this moment
throughout this practice if your mind
starts wandering about the things you
wish to be more productive towards
just let those thoughts flow
as you return your focus to the guidance
you are listening to
sometimes we let ourselves get hung up
in how things are quote unquote supposed
to be
when there are actually
an infinite number of creative
possibilities at any moment
we become more and more productive when
we let ourselves open up
to creative solutions
to perfect timing
[Music]
to allowing our desires to fuel us and
guide us
so
tune into an inner willingness within
you
feeling within your heart
that you are willing
ready and open
to aligning with perfect timing
to creative solutions
to following divine desires
take a big deep breath into this
willingness and readiness
holding your breath at the top
and whenever you're ready exhale with a
sigh
and as your breath returns to its
regular flow of breathing
listen to the following affirmations and
feel them as true for you
it is safe to trust my desires
i can trust the impulses that come to me
that feel good to me
when i trust my desires
and the loving impulses that come to me
i make wise decisions
i align with perfect timing
where everything just works out for
me everything i need to do falls into
place
in the highest most loving
happiest way
i am open to creative solutions
i am open to perfect timing
i allow myself to relax into perfectly
increased productivity
productivity that feels to me like fun
flow and ease
like everything just falling into place
i am open to this now
open to all creative solutions
open to perfect timing
and perfect flow
on your next inhale breathe in extra
deeply stomach and rib cage fully
expanding
holding your breath at the top
and whenever you're ready exhale with a
sigh
[Music]
and as your breath returns to whatever
pace feels good to you
begin to roll your shoulders
wiggle your
fingers and your toes
and when you're ready
open your eyes back to the world around
you
[Music]
trusting and knowing everything will
unfold in perfect timing for you
it's safe to trust your desires and
loving impulses
have fun being in flow today
[Music]
[Music]
you
