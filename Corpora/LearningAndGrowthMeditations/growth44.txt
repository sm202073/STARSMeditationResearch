allow yourself to get into a comfortable
position
lovingly close your eyes if you have not
already done so
and turn your awareness inwards
focus on your breath
and your body
dropping your awareness in
towards your heart center
in the middle of your chest and a couple
of inches
inwards feel your belly expand as you
breathe in
and release as you breathe out
you are safe here in this moment
all there is
is this
moment
throughout the course of this meditation
if at any point you find your mind
wandering that's perfectly okay
just return your attention to the words
and music you're hearing
as well as your breath and your body
building a healthy mindset
takes time
and commitment
but you were born to do this
tune in to a sense of knowing within you
that you are meant to have a healthy
mindset towards life
a part of you deep down knows
that it is natural
for you to have a healthy mindset
take a deep breath into this stomach and
rib cage fully expanding
holding your breath at the top
and when you're ready exhale with a sigh
return to breathing at a pace that feels
good to you
really using your breath to be here in
this moment
there's a voice in your heart
that always has a healthy mindset for
you
as you continually tune into the space
in the middle of your chest
you begin to tap in to an endless well
of love here
you imagine a silvery white light
flowing out from your heart
up into your mind
and then flowing back down from your
mind
into your heart
creating an infinity symbol as the light
flows back and forth
from your heart to your mind
connecting at your throat
feel the flow of energy here
breathing in you feel the energy rising
up from your heart to your mind
breathing out you feel the energy
flowing back down from your mind to your
heart
creating a swirling vortex of clean
smooth
clear energy
the light from your heart
washes away any stale stagnant energy
uplifting
radiating
bringing the vibration of peace and love
into your mind
[Music]
unconditional
universal love lives within you
you can feel it in your heart
regardless of how connected or not
connected you have been to this love it
is always there for you
and when you tap in
you recognize
it can flow through
not just in your heart but also in your
mind
the healthiest mindset is a mindset
guided by unconditional love
for yourself
the world
and a deep trusting and knowing
that all is working out for you
indeed
all is
working out for you
you are safe
you are loved
[Music]
for now just tune in to the cycle of
breathing
seeing the silvery white light
traveling from heart to mind
and mind to heart
creating that beautiful symbol of
infinity
crossing paths in the middle of your
throat
you may even feel a cleansing and
opening in your throat as well
just allow this flow to occur
tuning into it
loving it
recognizing it is love
[Music]
so
the light grows so bright now
it becomes a large
open column
encompassing you
completely
above your hand and below your toes this
silvery white light extends out
[Music]
encompassing you fully
in unconditional love
you feel your mind open and clear
connected to unconditional love
and just beyond this tube of white light
you begin to see a ring of soft pink
roses
this ring of roses travels up and down
this column of light
only love may enter into your space
and only love may exit out
all possibilities
that you most desire
are
possible for you
your mind is open to creative solutions
you recognize that you get to choose
your mindset
perhaps in the past you've put your
faith in fear
but moving forward
you stay committed
to placing your faith only in love
the radiance of this decision glows from
the inside out within you
out into the world around you
you choose the mindset
of love
[Music]
you put your faith
in yourself
for you are
loved
you put your faith in the world
for the world is love
you put your faith
in
love
and this mindset
radiates forth from you to the world
around you
creating a ripple effect out into the
world
take a deep breath in stomach and
ribcage fully expanding
holding your breath at the top feeling
how good this feels
and when you're ready exhale with a sigh
you are where you're meant to be
all is unfolding perfectly for you
know this
as you roll your shoulders
wiggle your fingers and toes
feel genuine appreciation for your
beautiful mind your beautiful heart your
beautiful soul
and when you're ready
slowly
open your eyes back to the beautiful
world around you
you
