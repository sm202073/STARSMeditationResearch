hi this is Joe Tracy and welcome to this
guided meditation on removing blocks and
barriers so to get started allow
yourself get in a comfortable chair or
lying in bed and taking a nice big deep
breath
and as he release it imagine the tension
getting to leave your body
and with your eyes closed
focus your attention at the bottoms of
your feet
imagine that their cords going from the
soles of your feet down into the earth
grounding you and ultimately connecting
you
imagine that there's now
stream of liquid relaxation now flowing
up to the center of those courts into
the soles of your feet and imagine that
liquid relaxation is now spreading
throughout the bottoms of your feet
relaxing here
feeling very calm and peaceful and any
outside noises that you may become aware
of will simply help you to relax more
and more
and that liquid relaxation is now
spreading spreading to the tops of your
feet to your ankles relaxing you even
more as you sink deeper and deeper down
continuing to focus on this Pleasant
feeling
liquid relaxation now spreads through
your shins
your calves your knees and your thighs
and your legs are feeling very relaxed
now as you're sinking deeper and deeper
down and that liquid relaxation is now
flowing through your hips your pelvis
your stomach feeling very relaxed and it
feels so good to just let go and to
allow this liquid relaxation to spread
throughout your body
very nerve
so working at muscle
and their liquid relaxation it's now
flowing into your chest filling your
heart and lungs allowing you to brave
deeper and even more relaxed
and now that liquid relaxation spreading
to your shoulders softening all the
muscles there in your shoulders
and it might even feel like a great
weight just been lifted from your
shoulders relaxing you even more
you're sinking deeper down and the
liquid relaxation now spreads from your
shoulders down through your back
softening each and every muscle there in
your back
and now that liquid relaxation spreads
from your shoulders down through each
arm down to your elbows your forearms
your wrists and your hands all the way
down to your fingertips and it's so calm
so peaceful
and the liquid relaxation is now
spreading through your neck and throat
beer chin and jaw through your cheeks
behind your eyes or your forehead
on the top of your head and every part
of your face is completely relaxed in
fact your entire body from the tips of
your toes to the top of your head it's
filled with this wonderful liquid
relaxation and you're feeling so calm
and unpeaceful
now in just a moment I will begin the
countdown and with each descending
number your level of relaxation multiple
want that to happen and allow that to
happen
five sinking deeper and deeper down four
so calm so peaceful and so relaxed three
letting go and it feels so good to just
let go two getting even closer now
one now peacefully and comfortably
relaxed
and now that you relaxed
it's important to know
and all things are possible in this
private Haven this peaceful place let's
take a walk out of your sanctuary and
into a garden
now as you walk through this beautiful
garden notice the beautiful flowers
along each side and you feel more
peaceful
and comfortable deep snap feeling so
contempt
and this path leads you to further
enlightenment
along this path you easily experience
spiritual growth
however your journey comes to an abrupt
end when you suddenly see before you
stone rock wall
approach the wall that barricades your
way
as you look around on either side of the
mall you see that there's no way around
this wall
and as you look up at how high the wall
is you realize that you have to go past
this wall the progress on your journey
remaining on the side of the wall limits
your personal growth
perhaps you can jump over this wall move
back just a bit and run a few steps
jumping up as high as you can
however you cannot reach the top you
slide back down and this time you walk
back even further
and you run harder and jump towards the
top of this wall but you still cannot
reach the top again you slide back down
the wall
so now you go back many feet and with a
running start you run as hard as you can
and jump as high as you can and clench
your fingers on the top of the wall soon
start scratching your arms hurting your
elbows as you fall back upon the ground
and suddenly you realize that this wall
it's a part of yourself that you've
repressed it's a part of you carefully
hidden from the world and perhaps even
yourself
this wall was a block on your journey
through life it's a part of yourself
and needs to be healed
but you must move beyond this wall in
order to continue to grow and learn
about yourself so one more time we try
to go over this wall you start back even
further and run harder you jump as high
as you can
climbing grasping at the wall
but you slide down scratching your face
and hands hurt your knees and as you
stand up and look at yourself you
realize that to fight this wall will
destroy you so you think what am I gonna
do how am I gonna get past this wall
this part of myself that needs to be
healed if it's important for you to know
take a moment now to understand a part
of you is causing this block what is the
emotion or event that has kept you stuck
walk up now and place your hands on the
wall you can smell the stones and feel
the roughness of the wall you realize
again there's no way around this wall
and no way to go over or under this wall
you have to go through the wall
ask yourself I will take you through
this wall all your beliefs will help you
now a belief in yourself that you can do
anything and you can do it
begin the pro one foot into the wall
and feel your foot go into the wall put
one hand into the wall bring your other
foot into the wall and your other hand
into the wall
you're now a few inches unto the wall
it's becoming very clear now
you have to get through this block in
order to heal there's no way around it
no way over it in no way to go under it
take one more step and another step
and soon you realize that the wall is
very thick but you're standing in it
somewhere in the middle of this wall
breathing easily and effortlessly
standing in the middle of your block you
may be wondering how can I do this how
can I move myself through a wall
did you have a choice you may go back to
the other side of the wall or you can
continue toward greater freedom and
personal growth
and if you decide to continue through
this wall take another step and another
step and as you can get almost to the
edge of the wall you have to decide can
I continue can I break through this wall
can I get through this block
you can do it just take one more step
push yourself out suddenly you're
standing on the other side of this wall
you see a strange new world before you a
world
they've never seen before
free open healthy world for you to
personally experience
freed forever from your block continue
on your path now notice how different
you feel as you continue on this path
you come to a lake
stop and look at your reflection in the
water see how different you look now
your thoughts are different your view of
the world has changed the world around
you seems brighter more clear the colors
are more vibrant the air even smells
fresher enjoy this new improved world
within
take a few moments now to absorb this
transformation enjoying the shift within
at your deepest level absorbing the
change and every cell every thought and
every believe
you
accepting all suggestions which were
positive and beneficial for you and
releasing anything that does not fit
into your life at this time
in just a moment
I will invite you to return from your
experience
and as you return you will bring back
your experience with you feeling calm
and refreshed one feeling returning to
your fingers and toes to all energies
and complete balance Theret body closed
three feeling more confident and in
control realizing things that used to
bother you in the past have now been
released for feeling as if your eyes
haven't bathe and cool clear water five
realizing you have now release the
blocks and now you'll experience more
self development and spiritual growth
eyes open fully aware
you
