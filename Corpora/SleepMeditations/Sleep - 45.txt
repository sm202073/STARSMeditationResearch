[Music]
hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this chakra balancing
meditation that it's aim is to help to bring harmony to your chakras cleansing
your aura and guiding you into a deep restorative sleep before we begin I'd
like to give you a little bit of a background on the nature of the chakras within the body there are seven main
chakras that line the spine we can imagine these chakras as spinning
vortexes of energy unseen to the eye they underlie whatever our current
experience may be each chakra corresponds to specific organs feelings
and behaviors this healing meditation will bring awareness to these energy centers and balance them allowing energy
to flow freely in all parts of our body we'll explore these in more detail as we
dive into our meditation but for now rest in the knowledge that regardless of
how you come into this meditation you will soon bring harmony to each one of
these spinning centers of energy to each level of yourself
as the chakras begin to balance your overall being will come into greater
harmony and transcendence a deep and healing cleanse of your overall aura
will take place and soon you will enter into a deep and restful sleep
so to begin make sure that you are comfortable you might like to use any
cushions or blankets that you need to make sure that your body is prepared to relax fully
and sure than any potential distractions such as computers are turned off and
that you will not be disturbed as you enter into this healing meditation and
sleep once your body is prepared for relaxation allow your mind to follow
to invite any lingering thoughts of the day to gently loosen their grip and fall
away so let us begin now the tune into your
breath in order to guide the mind away from thought let it flow deeply in and
out of your body allowing it to renew you in each unfolding moment
take a few deep breaths here now
on your next inhalation bring your attention to the top of your head and
just allowing the breath to follow at its natural rhythm
on your next breath in pause for a moment and then allow that exhale to
come all the way back down to the base of the spine just breathing slowly and
gently
continue to pay attention to your breathing for a few more cycles creating
a pathway of light of breath along your spine upwards on each inhale and
downwards on each exhale
allow this breathwork to guide you into a deep state of relaxation
now come back to your normal breath allowing it to flow effortlessly through you
we'll begin our journey by connecting to the lowest chakra to the root chakra
bring your awareness to the base of your spine once more in order to connect with
this chakra residing at the pelvic floor this energy center is our base it is
from where we harness our sense of support security and safety as we make
our way through this journey on earth
when the root chakra is balanced we feel grounded and connected to the place we
are presently in we feel safe to journey out knowing the deep roots connect us to
our inner and outer foundations we can
feel the earth steep embrace knowing that the earth provides what we require
to live harmoniously the color of this
chakra is red take a moment now to breathe deeply into the base of the
spine envisioning the warmth of the color red
allow it to ground you in the present moment physically emotionally and
spiritually know that you are safe here safe to enter into this deep state of
relaxation and harmony allow the music
my voice your physical world and your inner world to support you
begin to introduce slowly and gently the affirmation I am safe and supported I am
safe and supported I am safe and
supported
[Music]
continue breathing deeply into the pelvic floor allowing yourself to feel
intimately connected to the physical space you rest in sinking Deva to your
body
[Music]
now moving upwards gently guide your attention to the sacral chakra located between the pubic
bone and the navel within this swirling vortex of energy we find our sense of
creativity intimacy sexuality and connection to others emotions arise from
this Center and you may find that as we venture into this space you sense this
rising of the emotional world if this is
true to your experience at this point or any other moment during this meditation
know that you are supported and loved exactly as you are
rest in the knowledge that you are being balanced and healed in this very moment simply by allowing the music and these
words to permeate your being when the
sacral chakra is balanced we experience pleasure abundance joy and warmth we
feel intimately connected to those around us and feel harmonious within our
relationships we experience the joy of the nature of life the joy of creation
so take a moment to envision the color orange now with your attention
allow it to permeate this space between your hips just above your pubic bone and
feel yourself begin to open up to this warmth and to this healing slowly begin
to introduce the affirmation I am connected to others I flow freely
I am connected to others I flow really
[Music]
continue to breathe deeply into the sacral chakra and return to this affirmation as many times as the mind
wanders I am connected to others I flow really
[Music]
we will now continue our ascension to the solar plexus located just above the
navel this energy center brings us confidence self-worth and personal power
take a moment now to envision this radiant vortex just above the navel ear
into its innate power and its warmth
[Music] when the solar plexus is balanced we
feel a strong sense of purpose motivation and direction when balanced
we hold a calm confidence in our ability to manifest the life we desire we move
confidently in the direction of our dreams [Music]
bring your awareness to the solar plexus now envisioning the radiance and
lightness of the color yellow
be ovis energy center expanding radiating out from your core and
carrying it with a new sensation of aliveness purpose and a sure but subtle
strength
feel Solar plexis awakening meeting this bright healing yellow light as it grows
and expands
[Music]
now gently introduce the affirmation I radiate confidence I radiate confidence

let us move gently now into the heart chakra the home of our innately
compassionate and loving nature bring your attention to this space in the
center of your chest and envision your heart expanding with each inhale and
softening with each exhale
[Music]
[Music] this middle chakra where our downward
moving and upward flowing energies meet in perfect harmony is where our capacity
for love resides when balanced we are able to give love
unconditionally and we are able to receive the same gift from others and
from ourselves [Music]
rest now in the simplicity of this beautiful compassionate center envision
the color green expanding from the heart with each breath notice the pure energy
of the heart radiating outwards healing the heart itself and also the entirety
of your being [Music]
the hearts message is quite simple take a moment to introduce the affirmation I
love and am loved
allow it to permeate all cells of your being as you slowly repeat yourself I
love and am loved continue to give the
heart permission to expand and to soften knowing that it is safe to do so right
here right now [Music]
gently guide your awareness now up to the throat chakra sitting in the throat
area this expansive vortex of energy governs our ability to speak our
authentic truth and to listen to that of others allow your attention now to
settle here noticing any sensations residing deep in the throat
[Music]
when the throat chakra is balanced we find a lightness and trust in who we are
and find freedom to express our highest truths communication is an open space
and an exchange so what we are able to give we are able to receive when
balanced we are able to listen compassionately to the true expression of another being
begin to envision the color blue expanding from the throat imagining it
radiating upwards from where you rest painting the entire sky let it surround
you allow your being to flow freely within this vast blue atmosphere
[Music]
[Music]
feel into the lightness of the free air trusting where it gently moves you
[Music]
gently introduced the mantra I express my truth really i express my truth
freely [Music]
notice the body becoming lighter as you embrace your expanding authentic being
[Music]
come now softly to the third eye this energy center swells between your
eyebrows and is the Gateway to your inner knowledge take a moment to bring
your attention to this space sensing the freely spinning energy exists here
[Music] when the third eye is balanced we are able to access our inner knowing and our
higher mind with greater ease our perceptions are clearer and our
intuition is strengthened we do not need to speak the wisdom that comes at this
level we are simply able to witness it and embrace it
imagination is heightened as we float effortlessly into this deeper reality
[Music]
[Music] invision now the powerful color indigo
pulsating from the third I simply draw
your attention here knowing that there is nothing to figure out nothing to
rationalize and nothing to think through
just allowing the mind to drift away and let the deeper levels of the mind flow
in naturally effortlessly
silently introduce the affirmation I see in a wisdom clearly I see in a wisdom
clearly allow this truth and the color
indigo to bathe and to heal the mind allow yourself to fall further into the
depths of your being
[Music]
[Music]
