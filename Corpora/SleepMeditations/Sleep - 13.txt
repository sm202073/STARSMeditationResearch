[Music]
hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will take you on a
journey to your inner child as you encounter the child within you'll be
guided into developing a more loving freeing and forgiving relationship with
this aspect of self then you may previously have had my name is Jason
Stephenson and thank you for joining me tonight allow your heart to open to this
transformative process as you develop perhaps a new or reimagined way of
relating to that child within so to begin take your time to find a
comfortable resting position where you can settle in for the night ahead [Music]
ensure that your spine is as straight as possible they're still relaxed and allow your
limbs to rest comfortably and naturally
with your eyes closed take a few moments to reconnect with your breath simply
notice the way it waxes and wanes through the body
soften your brow [Music] you're turning your jaw
and your belly as you settle deeper into the space that holds you
[Music]
and see if you might allow the stomach to rise and fall to its fullest capacity
with each breath with each in-breath the
belly extends with ease and with each
breath out it gently falls back down [Music]
extending with ease as it feels and
falling gently as it empties
now before we take a journey to meet the inner child
let us ground ourselves in compassion patience and care each one of us has a
unique relationship to our inner child and sometimes it is a challenging one
for this reason it is important that we
establish ourselves in love before moving further so take a moment now to
draw your attention to the heart space watching as the breath flows into and
out of this loving center of your body
you might imagine that each inhalation feeds your inner capacity for love and
that each breath out softens any resistance to self-love and care
and as you breathe through the heart take a few moments to reaffirm the
following sentiments that will support you on your journey I am patient and
gentle with myself [Music]
I care for and embrace my innermost self
I support myself unconditionally
I am grounded in love and compassion
let these words dissipate into the background as you sink into this energy
of loving-kindness continue to mind the breath
remembering that each inhalation fuels you and that each exhalation frees you
of what is no longer required
and as we move through this journey know that your experience will be as unique
as you and your inner child are for some this process might be difficult know
that as you move through this you are always encouraged to follow your own
inner guidance so be sure to do whatever you need to do to support yourself just
allow my words to guide you and remember that you can always come back to the
breath to ground you [Music]
before we move into this visualization let's take three deep cleansing breaths
together begin by letting your last
inhalation leave the body completely and then take a deep full breath in for the
count of four and then slowly exhale for
a count of six another deep breath in
for a slow count of four and when you've
reached the top slowly exhale for a count of six one last breath in for four
and let it back out for six
[Music] and allowing your breath to come back to
its natural rhythm as you sink into the surface beneath you use your breath as
an anchor whenever you need it to tether you back into this present moment now
let all unnecessary tension slowly begin to dissolve into the space that supports
you allow yourself to be held here unconditionally to begin this visual
journey turn your attention towards your mind's eye and imagine yourself standing
in a deep lush evergreen forest your
feet are firmly rooted in a pressed Earth pathway that weaves through the
trees and all around you majestic aspen spruce and pine trees
climb up into the clear blue sky [Music]
your spine is straight your chest is open and your shoulders are relaxed and
as you breathe you do so deeply welcoming the cleansing pine infused air
into the depths of your lungs
you exhale with a soft sigh letting go of anything that does not serve you here
[Music]
take three full deep breaths at your own pace now letting the crisp and clean forest air
cleanse mind body and soul
you [Music]
and after your third deep breath you begin your journey ahead step-by-step
you make your way through the enchanted forest that holds you the air is a
comfortable temperature keeping you both warm and refreshed
observe the colors and textures that fill your eyesight as you pass through
this landscape what shapes do the trees take
what hues appear in the leaves the trunks of the trees and any other plant
life that thrives here [Music] what richness and diversity is apparent
to you
[Music]
the further you venture the more settled you feel this flourishing ecosystem
holds you as one of its own leading you gently onwards down your own path of
healing
it's not long before there is a break in the trees and you step out of the woods
upon the site of a magnificent shimmering lake your shoulders drop even
further from your ears as your soul is stirred by this body of water you
approach the water's edge slowly inching your way towards the rocky shoreline
that surrounds it the still water loves
you right up to its edge and so you take a seat on the smooth rock face
overlooking the water to rest for a while [Music]
[Music] the Sun inches its way towards the treeline inviting a car and wrested
energy to the fading day the wind is barely traceable and the flat water
sparkles beneath the Setting Sun all is well as you gaze across the water
you realize you feel deeply content in this space and time there is nothing
missing from this moment and yet your heart is wide open to whatever might
come your way you feel strong stable and
secure in who and where you are
remaining seated here something draws your attention down the shore that leads
into the Setting Sun some distance away
you notice someone making their way towards you it is a young person perhaps
five or six years of age though their exact age is entirely up to you this
individual slowly makes their way closer and closer to you until soon you realize
that the person approaching is you it is
you from some many years ago it is the child within the child that has always
kept some space within you [Music]
they're returning to you and you to them
[Music]
take a moment to fully notice this child let your heart be completely open to
their presence regardless of how they've shown up today
[Music]
[Music]
this child moves carefully and as they come within a few meters distance you
offer a few words of kindness and invite them to come and sit next to you
knowing they're safe in this visualization they come to take a seat
in front of you
you begin this interaction simply by extending the warmth of your heart onto
this small person before you grounded in
a wisdom and self compassion that they have yet to develop you hold this energy
for them simply through your presence you offer them your unconditional
acceptance [Music]
meeting their eyes you take in the heart and soul of this child and you ask them
if there is anything on their heart or mind [Music]
leave plenty of space for what arises and if or as they speak listen without
judgment simply hold space but whatever
it is they are feeling know also that it
is okay if they do not have any words to say your inner child may speak through
nonverbal language
and in the face of whatever arises whether that be fear joy anger grief
guilt playfulness or anything else you offer them your love you offer this
child your compassion without expectation and without condition let
yourself be there Rock as steady as the physical rock beneath you
you
nurture them in whatever way feels most comfortable for the two of you perhaps
that is through a big hug or through hands held tightly or perhaps it is
simply through holding the space for one another know that there is no right or
wrong way to nurture your inner child here
[Music]
[Music]
and then ask your inner child if there is something they'd like your help with
is there something they'd like you to set free for them is there something
they would like you to forgive
[Music]
let this child know that they have your unconditional support in releasing
anything that does not serve their sense of happiness and wholeness you as their
wise elder can offer them the love support and forgiveness that they've
been yearning for
[Music] and now
in the silent space that holds you both next to the lake you might silently repeat to them I see
you I hear you I love you
I am here for you I support you
I forgive you
I honor you
I embrace you
I free you
take some more time now to fully embrace this in a child through your loving
presence through hands held or through a warm and caring hug let this child be
held by your love and by your strength [Music]
let this child take the time they need to feel as they feel reminding them that
you are not here to change them you are simply here to listen and to support
[Music] and as they feel heard the inner world
begins to quiet as does your own
soon the two of you sit peacefully and contently gazing out over the calm
waters of the lake at dusk [Music]
The Sun has disappeared behind the trees and a warm orange glow stretches across
the horizon the sky above is ocean blue
slowly deepening its turn as the day fades away
you and your inner child look towards one another and smile you were grateful
for this moment and for this opportunity to reconnect
[Music]
you and as the colors of the sky signal that
it is almost time for slumber you ask your inner child where they like to rest
for the night perhaps they yearn to go to bed in a
place from your shared past perhaps they
longed to slumber beneath the open starry sky or perhaps they would find
the most peace the most happiness falling asleep in some imagined land
that inspires them wherever your inner
child finds peace and comfort let them know you will guide them there
[Music] and then slowly slowly letting the
landscape in your mind transform call to mind the place where they know they will
rest with the most ease [Music]
imagine what this place looks like and what comforts it holds
wherever you find yourself invite your inner child to settle into a cozy and
comfortable bed for the night you tuck
them in with love and care reminding them that you are always here for them
and as they surrender into the night you whisper the words I love you I am here
for you I love you I am here for you I
[Music] love you
[Music] I am here for you
[Music] spend a few more silent moments whispering these words to your inner
child perhaps aligning the words I love you with your inhalations and I'm here
for you with your exhalations
the inner child drifts off to sleep and you are left with the revitalized sense
of love and care for this part of yourself you set an intention now that
when the signs of this inner child arise in you in the future you will tend to
them with unconditional patience presence love and compassion
[Music]
now you two are ready to surrender into sleep and so you come back to your body
letting the evenings visualizations gently begin to dissipate
[Music]
notice the felt sense of your body being supported by the bed or other surface
beneath you what does it feel like to be
held here [Music]
notice the breath as it flows through you creating an expansion and a
softening with each full cycle
and then draw your attention to the heart space once again connecting with
the center of your compassion for one last time before drifting into sleep
[Music] and as you hold your attention here
imagine a small white light beginning to appear in the center of your chest it
expands outwards with each second that goes by and as it permeates through your
body it offers its a loving energy to each cell that it passes
[Music]
soon your entire body is held in this healing white light arising from within
it nurtures every part of you the present self the past self and the
future self all at the same time
[Music] spend just a few more moments now
feeling yourself as you were bathed in this warm glow
[Music]
and when you were ready slowly let that light dissipate
come back to the felt sense of your body in this space let yourself connect
intimately with the earth that supports you here and then let your attention
come back to the breath noting this natural movement as it passes through
you
if there is anything else that needs to be released let it out now with a deep
sigh [Music]
allow your breath to be an anchor for your awareness as you slowly drift into
slumber
sleep well my friend sleep well
