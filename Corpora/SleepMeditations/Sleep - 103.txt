hello and welcome i'm sarah raymond from the mindful movement
allow me to be your guide into a relaxing deep sleep thank you for joining me
tonight release all your worry and fears develop a calm
and peaceful state for sleep connect with the ease of your body your
mind your spirit and your heart for a tranquil night's sleep
when you wake many hours later you will experience a life of peace
free of worry now i invite you to make yourself
comfortable take a moment and make sure your
environment is all set for you to safely drift into sleep
settle into comfort for the night
close your eyes and let this be a signal to your body to let go
as your eyes close and you turn off the outside world
you can invite your body to release any obvious tension or tightness
perhaps soften the muscles in and around your eyes
unclench your jaw and welcome this release to travel down
your body relaxing your neck and shoulders
next
let your chest open [Music] and your belly soften
welcome the heaviness of the relaxed state of your legs
letting go completely into the surface below you
sense any remaining tension from your day being released through the bottom of
your feet to allow you to safely let go
into tranquility
become aware of where your body makes contact with the surface below you
let this point of contact ground you [Music]
feel this as support [Music] and allow yourself to be fully supported
you are safe you can trust in the universe
use this sensation of where you and your support meet
to draw your awareness gradually from your outer experience
to your inner world [Music]
notice without judgment what your physical sensations are in
this moment
your body has the amazing ability to cope with challenges and to grow
stronger from them if you allow and let go
of resistance
it is okay to befriend the fear that shows up for you
fear is not the enemy it is a helpful and necessary emotion when it is
channeled correctly
as you continue to relax physically even deeper
allow your attention to move inward to rest easily on your breath
notice the air as it goes in and out through your nose
feel your breath from within
as it comes in and as it goes out
like an ocean wave rolling into shore
and back out again [Music]
your attention on the wave of your breath
will aid in deepening your peaceful state
and allow sleep to easily come to you without any effort
during any moments of silence if you find your mind wandering
bring your attention back to your breath
perhaps you may feel your stomach rise
or your ribs expand as you breathe naturally
or you may notice the feel of air passing through your nostrils
whatever draws your attention [Music] about your natural breath
let your attention easily linger here for another moment
[Music]
so
[Music]
while there are many things in life that you don't have control over
your breath is one aspect that you can direct a little bit
to continue relaxing and letting go even deeper
invite your breath to lengthen
begin to deepen your inhale for the next few cycles of breath
and on your next exhalation release all the air completely
letting go letting go letting go
this full exhale will prepare your lungs to receive your next
inhale each deep inhale brings in fresh
oxygen each full exhale releases the stale
air carbon dioxide and toxins
each focused breath cycle is cleansing and healing you
with each passing exhale you can say in your mind letting go
and each release of air takes with it any tension
and allows you to relax even deeper
breathe in fresh oxygen
breathe out letting go
[Music] breathe in nourishing oxygen
breathe out release any toxins or tension
breathe in calmness
breathe out stress
breathe in light breathe out darkness
breathe in love breathe out hate
breathe in clarity breathe out confusion
[Music]
breathe in peace
breathe out worry
breathe in breathe out letting go
allow my voice to be your guide into relaxation
you can drift off to sleep when your body is ready and
your subconscious mind will continue listening and relaxing
like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow down
in relationship to each breath
as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath
and the similar space or pause between your thoughts
invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen
be in the gap
no need to do anything simply be in this space
[Music]
as you continue to relax and drift towards sleep
allow my voice to guide you into the most tranquil state
where you are free and clear
now in your mind imagine a place where you can be
completely relaxed and free
[Music] where you can be entirely at peace
this might be a place where you have been to before
or one that exists only in your mind
if no specific image or visualization comes to mind
easily you may consider the feeling or the energy
of this space [Music]
and this place is your personal sanctuary
perhaps you might feel this freedom on a beach or a
calm trail in the woods or maybe your mind takes you to a
special place in your home
whatever feels right to you is simply perfect this
is your personal sanctuary
it is your ideal spot for relaxation and peace
see this special place in your mind's eye [Music] in as much detail as you can
experience your sanctuary using all your senses
as you rest in this personal peaceful sanctuary
know that you are safe within yourself [Music]
in this special place it feels good and safe to let go
of worries let go of fears
as if they simply dissolve into thin air to be gone
from your life for good
in this place powerful emotional healing takes place
[Music] and will continue through the night
as you sleep
as you rest easy in your safe and peaceful sanctuary
consider the times in life when releasing gives way to growth
[Music]
trees must let go of leaves in the fall to have the opportunity
for new growth [Music]
waves in the ocean flow in to the shore and back out again
creating a natural ebb and flow
many animals must shed their skin or outer layer in order
to grow
humans have a period of exhalation to make room for the next inhalation
consider the times when resistance creates more difficulty
for example the spinning wheels of a car in mud the more you try to get out
the deeper the wheels dig into the mud
can you find any areas where you are holding on
and then let go [Music]
perhaps you may be holding at the area of your stomach
can you let go
can you open the flow of energy within you
continue to connect with relaxation and letting go
as deeply as you can
practice surrender
practice letting go
open to the healing energy within
are you able to relax even more
connect even deeper to yourself
[Music] listen to your heart surrender to your inner wisdom
let go of your body further and further into
relaxation
let go and drift effortlessly into peace
let go of any thoughts of worry
any thoughts that might be holding you back from experiencing tranquility
let go of any thoughts holding you back from sleep
[Music] see these thoughts drift off
in the wave of relaxation
they will be there when you need them in this calm state of your mind
let go of worries so that you can sleep peacefully now
what you resist persists
acknowledge your thoughts with acceptance without the need to follow them into
story
meet your present experience with
permission allow your thoughts to come
and go without resistance
welcoming a calmness to wash over you [Music]
completely [Music] let go of anything you might be holding
on to from yesterday or earlier today
let go of anything that may be taking up space in your mind
give yourself permission to be here right now
sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission
to let go of the past
give yourself some space for something new
something to grow into
[Music]
and now you have prepared your mind and your body for a deep
peaceful and restful night sleep
your subconscious mind is clear and free
your mind and body are relaxed
sleep is easily coming to you
allow this to happen if you wish
take the final steps into a deep restful slumber
as you drift into dreaming sleep you will continue to experience
a peaceful and calm mind and body
as you drift into serene peaceful rest my voice
will gradually disappear and you will be deeply asleep
when you wake hours later your body and mind will
continue to experience this amazing peaceful state
you are so incredibly relaxed
there is a sense of inner peace flowing through your body
you are in the perfect place to get the best night sleep
you will wake up tomorrow feeling rested and ready to move forward
