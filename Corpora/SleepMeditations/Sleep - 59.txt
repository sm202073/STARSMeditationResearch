sleep well a guided meditation sleep talked down it's time to get comfortable
now this meditation is best done lying down and preferably in bed prior to
wanting to go to sleep so begin by closing your eyes having your hands
placed beside you and taking in three deep breaths breathing in through the
nose and out through the mouth really
take deep breaths here and letting go of all the tension of the day on the breath
out and after you've done this bring
your breathing back to its natural rhythm not trying to change your rhythm
just being aware of the breath coming in and going out
with each breath in fill your body relax and loosen a little bit more and with
each breath out feel the tension of the day melting away
your body becomes supple and relaxed
deeply relaxed [Music]
whilst you are beginning to relax know that soon sleep will come you do not
need to strive for it to obtain it you just need to listen to my voice as I
guide you towards it naturally and without effort if any thoughts come into
your mind during this meditation that's perfectly normal it's okay for this to happen we are
thinking beings and so we think thousands of thoughts a day what I ask
you to do is simply observe the thoughts without attaching to it and in their own
time allow them to melt away whilst you focus back on my voice or to your
breathing now make sure you are lying
comfortably and if not change your position now even just slightly
make sure that your body is evenly balanced your hands out to the side and
mentally check right now for any tension throughout your body poor posture or
day-to-day stresses can make you hold tension in various parts of your body it's time now to just let it all go
focusing on your feet move them a little and tense them hold that tension and now
let them go shake any tension free just allow them to fall naturally tighten up
your ankles and calf muscles then your knees squeeze it all tightly hold and
let the tension go really really relaxed this part of your body
do the same now for your thighs hips and buttocks tighten then stretch out and
release just let go as though this part of your body is just melting through to
the floor [Music]
now tighten your back and your stomach area tense hold and release all this
tension let it go if you feel any
tension here that seems to be deeply rooted you can repeat this again
now move onto your arms tightening your arms shoulders and neck muscles hold and
release let go
make sure that your jaw is relaxed let your tongue rest against the roof of
your mouth and your lips be open slightly we often carry tension across the scalp
and forward to just breathe in and exhale and visualize the muscles
relaxing at will and again breathing in
and on the breath out see your facial muscles just relax
systematically working your way through your body in this enables you to eradicate tension and allows our muscles
to relax it enables you to embrace deep sleep as it happens without worrying
about it it becomes a routine a positive behavior that leads naturally towards
sleep you just have to let go of everyday problems and learn to empty
your mind doing this form of meditation practice can help you to let go of
everyday problems by focusing on other things and it helps release thoughts old
thoughts negative thoughts unwanted thoughts for the day when these thoughts
come up simply always keep coming back to my talking or your own breathing if
you struggle to stop the bombardment of thoughts infiltrating your mind or find
that you constantly try to solve problems the moment you lie down instead turn your attention to your breathing
inhale and count the breath in for four seconds hold the breath for four and
then exhale for a count of four this can
work wonders take a slow deep breath breathe in and
feel the breath filling all the way up from the diaphragm and all the way up to
the top of the lungs now exhale slowly and feel the diaphragm deflating and
tension starting to dissipate now repeat
this do this again and this time on the breath out visualizing tension and
anxieties leaving your body every time you exhale find me one more time breathe
in deep breath in and let it go
now imagine yourself standing in a cavern at the top of some ancient steps
the steps have been carved into the rock face many years before and although you
were inside with the roof of the cavern being too high to reach you feel a cool
soothing breeze coming up the steps it's
a narrow set of steps but you are longing to know what is at the bottom as you are ready to settle down for the
night know that you will be safe as you
walk down them and it is a part of your journey towards deep and undisturbed
slumber strategically placed torches
with golden flickering flames light the way down the steps casting an orange
glow this late hour [Music]
as you progress down the steps know that you will become more and more relaxed
trail your hands down the rocky walls as you progress downwards one step at a
time slowly and steadily listen to the sound
of my voice but allow the sensations of the moment to filter within visualize
the texture of the rock beneath your fingertips feel the slightly warm but
textured surface beneath your bare feet you feel a part of nature and a part of
history of this place you feel timeless sensations now step down again you feel
peaceful you are relaxed and you can let
go of any anxieties you may be holding on to
step down again you are truly relaxed
you feel safe and secure here step down
once more notice the blue shimmering light flickering at the foot of the
steps intrigued you keep moving
downwards you are so relaxed each step
takes you nearer to this fluctuating colored light feel relaxed absorb the
sense of peace in this place [Music]
[Music]
as you make your way down to the bottom step and emerge from the cavern you
realize that you are now outside at the bottom of a cliff but have emerged in
the most beautiful and quiet secret place there is a small pathway ahead of
you stepping stones that neatly interlock and guide you towards a
platform surrounding by sparkling waters that glisten under the velvet night sky
the sound of water trickling over tiny stones is soothing you pause to enjoy
these sounds for a few moments [Music]
[Music]
as you walk along the pathway your feet bear against the warmth of the stones
heated by the earlier Sun you see that the platform is small and partially
covered at the sides with a pliant willow frame adorned with honeysuckle and jasmine
climbing up over filling the air with the subtlest of sense stretching across
the platform but looking further out to see a hammock ideally placed for the
most relaxing nighttime experience take
a moment now to climb into the hammock it is easy there is no difficulty at all
here it is welcoming and as if it's designed just for you you slip
comfortably into place and feel it support your body in wait you have never
felt so relaxed you feel wonderful you
feel at peace you feel at one with nature bill your
body becoming heavy you are sinking into the hammock you are so comfortable up
above you the night sky reveals millions of stars dotted overhead and around you
the sound of water is making you so relaxed so very relaxed the moon sends a
silvery glow revealing a purple expanse of sky peace floods through your being
let all thoughts go now let all anxieties go now drift away
relax breathe in and then exhale slowly
you are at one with nature you are at
peace the sound of the water nearby the waves
rhythmically lapping against the platform and the trickling over the stones and the shallows is soothing your
eyelids are becoming heavy you sink further into the hammock feeling warm
and sleepy let it happen give into the
sensation of drowsiness rift away you
can return here each night and allow the tranquility of this place to lull you to
sleep cherish this place and return here
each night sleep sleep deeply now relax
drift away
