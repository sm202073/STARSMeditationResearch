the shores and all the sand gets soaked with the ever-present peace when the
sand becomes dry again the peace stays within and the wind blows until it
spreads further away you are the
co-creator of ever-present peace
now bring your attention to every part of your body gradually
breathing in and breathing it out feel how your body
touches the surface of your bed continue
to go with the current flow allow peace
to prevail you as you drift further and further into a deep and relaxing sleep
