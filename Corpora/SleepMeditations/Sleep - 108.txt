deeply begin this meditation with the intention
to develop a positive perspective and connect with gratitude
I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes if you'd
like and settle in to comfort let your
body sink into the surface below you
make any adjustments to your physical body to let yourself settle deeper into
the support [Music]
you can be comforted at this time knowing you are safe supported and that
everything is okay there is nowhere to go and nothing to do you have set aside
this time to simply relax and drift off
into sleep there is no need to worry if
you don't hear everything I say the
deepest part of you is listening
if it feels right to you place your left hand over your heart and your right hand
on top of your left honor yourself and
the time you have taken to shift to a positive mindset and connect with
gratitude may you experience peace joy
and a connection with gratitude may this
practice invite you to cherish all that you are and all that you have in this
moment and may you be open to see the
positive silver linings of your experiences

ready become aware of your immediate
environment

allow yourself a moment to become aware of anything else that you can sense
[Music] are there any smells around you
is there anything you can see inside your closed eyelids
can you sense the temperature around you
allow your attention to move inward and
discover a safe place within a place
where you feel secure and loved

need it
