momentum of your energy to gradually find stillness
tonight begin with your eyes open and although it is likely dark in your room
roll your eyes up as if you are looking into your own eyebrows keep your eyes up
and take a deep breath in and out again
breathe in and know that every time you blink this is a sign that deep sleep is
coming to you and one more time deep
breath in and as you breathe out let your eyelids close since any fluttering
movement occurring in your eyes this
movement is a relaxed state of awareness coming to you a state of internal
awareness where your healing powers are increased the state will lead you into
deep uninterrupted healing sleep notice
the heaviness of your eyelids as you relax the muscles around your eyes your
face and neck are so relaxed that you couldn't even tense your muscles if you
tried you may even feel as if your
eyelids have been glued shut or locked together and it feels great to have them
closed they are feeling like they really
don't want to open
you'll find that when you try to open them they feel locked together
you notice the fluttering of your eyes once more and you go deeper into
relaxation you'll find the harder you
try to open them the more they feel heavy and you feel drowsy and you go
deeper you are surrendering into your
drowsiness and falling into the warm embrace of sleep without resistance
and now forget all about your eyes and just go deeper relax deeper drift deeper
already your cares and tensions are just fading away you're relaxing more and
more with each sound that you hear allow
a drifting floating feeling to develop throughout your entire body no need to
try to make it happen simply allow this enjoyable floating feeling to develop
with every breath you take let
relaxation come to you wash over you with each and every natural breath you
take
as you continue to drift into relaxation let your attention move to notice the
weight of your body sinking into the surface below you feel yourself
softening and letting go deeper into relaxation deeper into the surface
beneath you as your perceived boundaries are falling away the boundaries that
appear to separate your body from the space around it are disintegrating as
you take in a deep breath of air merging
what is inside of you with what is outside of you take in another deep
breath hold it for a moment if you can and then breathe out slowly letting go
letting go letting go do this again take
a deep full breath in hold for a moment
and breathe out as slowly as you can
and one more time breathe in hold and
let it all go

same let's sleep come easily to you give
yourself permission to relax as you go
