you [Music]
hello this is Sara Raymond and welcome to this meditation to help you increase
your confidence and inner strength to prepare you for the day ahead today I
will guide you into complete body and mind relaxation that can lead you into a
deep sleep if you would like or if you are not ready to sleep you will be deeply relaxed before we get started
make sure you are prepared to drift off to sleep when this recording is over if
you would like take a moment now to turn
off all distractions you can pause this recording if you like if there's
anything you need to do to prepare yourself for safe and comfortable
night's sleep know that you are safe and
supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you choose to do so
make yourself as comfortable as you can close your eyes and settle in for a deep
productive night's sleep so you'll wake in the morning feeling rejuvenated and
confident to start your day
somewhere deep inside us all we know there is someone trying to grow to the
surface our true self our higher self
when we delve into self exploration we can see this person we know what
direction we want to go for some of us the missing link is just the confidence
to believe in ourselves enough to take action
the confidence to live our life in alignment with what is truly important to us
the last moments before sleep are so important to us they have a tremendous
impact on how we start our next day when we wake up our thoughts pick up where
they left off we can use this as an opportunity to give us the best chance
to begin our day with a positive attitude and in alignment with our
values and intentions this meditation is
designed to help you drift off to sleep knowing you are going to have a great day
[Music] confident to handle all that comes your
way with a positive intention take a
moment before we begin this relaxation process to set an intention for the day
ahead the intention can be anything that
resonates with you it may be a specific quality you would like to embody more in
your life or an emotion you'd like to cultivate
maybe you would like to focus on being mindful and staying in the present moment
whatever intention is calling to you is fine
[Music]
once you have set your intention bring your awareness to the natural rhythm of
your breath at first simply noticed the sensations
that accompany your breath maybe you
feel a slightly cool sensation as the air passes through your nostrils
maybe you feel a floating sensation as your abdomen and chest rise and fill
with breath or a heaviness as the air moves out of
your body taking any attention with it
maybe the breath brings a warming sensation to the body as it travels along its path
whatever you're feeling is perfect simply observe the process
begin to count the length of your breath in
then as you breathe out invite the exhale to be one count longer than the inhale
allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress or
tension
by exhaling just a little longer than you inhale your breath will slow your
body and mind will calm down in response
breathe in this way for a few more cycles then allow your breath to return
to its natural rhythm [Music]
in a moment I will guide you through a full slow body scan to take you deeper
down into relaxation your body knows how to relax and
sometimes a simple invitation to do so is all that it takes to release any tension pain or areas of gripping
[Music]
imagine that you can send your breath to any area in your body and the breath
relaxes that area and make space for the energy to flow freely
now as we begin to scan the body bring your attention first to the top of your
head can you feel this area from the
inside of your body as sensations only
without moving your eyes as you scan the body simply move your awareness to each
part and relax that part completely
[Music] as you move your attention throughout
the body you will scan for any areas of tension tightness or pain and if you
find areas of tension stay on that part for a moment
and send your breath into that area to soften it invite the breath to wash over
any part wash away any tension like a way of moving over your body
[Music] do not attach to the feelings of your
body simply accept them as they are in this moment and ask your body to relax
and release [Music]
as you continue scanning your body you will feel this relaxing wave-like energy
move through your entire body and it takes you deeper and deeper into a safe
and supported state of sleep where you can build your confidence to live as
your highest self [Music]
and now move your attention from the top of your head down to your forehead and
feel a sense of softening and smoothing
[Music] continue to relax even deeper around the
area of your eyebrows and eyes as you
feel the tension from this area melt away your entire body softens a little
further [Music] feel your eyelids becoming very heavy
allow your cheeks to lengthen down and let go part your teeth unclench your jaw
and relax your tongue
the softening of your face and jaw will deepen the relaxation of your entire
body [Music]
you can now feel your throat softening
notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper
and deeper allowing this wave of comfort
to continue its journey down your body you feel your chest and shoulders
release and rest heavy
every breath in oxygenate the body to promote healing and recovery from your
day
now allow the front and back of both arms to relax imagine water droplets
flowing from your shoulders down your arms and out of your fingertips taking
away all of the stress and tension that your body carries since the relaxing of
the abdomen as it sinks down into the surface below you
and now inviting the relaxation to continue its path down your body into
your hips and lower back
linger on this area a little longer and ask your body for a sense of ease
let go of all of the tension and tightness held in this area
feel your body softening as each breath in creates space for an easy flow of
energy through your body
this comfort moves into both of your legs washing relaxation over your thighs your
knees your shins and your calves imagine
again the droplets of water flowing out of your legs and feet washing away any
remaining tension tightness or pain
you feel as it flows out of your body through the bottoms of your feet so that you are completely relaxed throughout
your entire body [Music]
know that your relaxed body will allow for productive recovery while you sleep
so you will awake feeling refreshed and rejuvenated and aligned with your
intention [Music]
you are now deeply relaxed and you can begin to use your
imagination I will guide you on a
journey taking you into a dream state where you can physically remain safe in
your bed while your mind will travel to a special place of relaxation
you can simply follow my voice or drift off to sleep whenever your body
is ready [Music]
today this journey takes you to a beautiful beach at dusk begin to imagine
this Beach in vivid detail
use all of your senses you can feel that
the temperature is perfect for you
look around at your surroundings
you see the blue water [Music] it's crystal clear with gentle crashing
waves
you can see and hear these crashing waves and as they hit the shore
each wave deep into your state of relaxation
[Music] the rhythmic sounds of the flowing water
brings you even deeper down into peace
[Music]
as you breathe in deeply you can smell the salty ocean air you can feel the
warm sand under your feet
as you continue to look around at this beautiful beach you see there are two
chairs sitting under an umbrella off to your right and you decide to walk over
to the chairs
each step you take simply relaxes you even further
ten you begin to walk over to the chairs and you are deeply relaxed you feel the
tension melting away nine you feel
yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need
to do you allow yourself to just be and drift
off into a comfortable sleep
eight notice how you are feeling calmer
you are feeling a deep sense of relaxation you are beginning to feel
sleepy
seven you invite this blissful relaxed state to wash over you
six you can feel your body begin the recovery and healing process that comes
with deep sleep
five letting go completely of the need to hold on to any tension or to guard
physically for drifting deeper and deeper into the
familiar heavy state of comfort
three almost to the deepest level of relaxation before you fall off to sleep
where your subconscious mind can build confidence
- deep deep relaxation and one all the
way into a deep state of relaxation and heavy comfort
[Music]
now that you are relaxed and safe and you have arrived to the chairs you sense
that there is someone special waiting for you sitting on the chair on the left
the chair is facing away from you so you don't know who this will be or how they
will appear you just have a strong feeling that
someone is there this special person you
may not recognize immediately it may have been a long time since you met
it could also be someone you haven't met before but someone you know of this person is
here for you they are here to help you gain confidence and inner strength they
are here to offer you guidance you have
a sense that this person knows what is in your heart and is here to support
your best interest
and now to satisfy your curiosity you walk around to sit in the chair on the
right the chair next to this special person who is here for you you begin to
recognize who is there you see their face slowly begin to come into focus
this person may be someone you once knew and loved dearly or maybe this isn't a
separate person it is simply part of you
an important part that you haven't listened to before a part that knows you
well and knows how you feel
[Music] once you recognize this person or this
part of you offer them a hug feel their warm embrace around you and take a
moment to thank them for coming to see you today
[Music]
you have such a strong feeling that your visitor is here for you and will do the
very best to help you find the confidence you need to live in alignment with your values and your highest self
and although your guest has not yet said a word you already know that your
visitor is here to offer guidance and support
the presence and energy of your visitor is positive and fills you up with love
confidence and gratitude sit with a
special person for a while and soak up the energy it relaxes you and it
increases your confidence
[Music]

you can continue to feel this way no matter the circumstances or the environment because you are a competent
person you believe in yourself and your abilities you accomplish your goals
you are grateful for the successes in your life anything big or small in all
areas of your life your thoughts are
positive and give you the confidence to grow and reach your goals
this confidence keeps you motivated and willing to move out of your comfort zone
when necessary

about your big dreams coming true and you never have any doubt that you will
succeed you know you are exactly where you are
supposed to be on your journey and you are grateful for every step you take

mistakes or failures for these are simply opportunities to learn and grow
you're aware of this feeling of gratitude and you choose to acknowledge
it often and express it to those close
to you you take time each day to pause
breathe and enjoy the present moment
[Music] because you're confident and grateful
you respect yourself by making choices that align with your intentions

handle your life better to take better care of yourself to respect yourself and
that's all it really takes in any moment to grow and be successful especially
when challenged

breakthrough even in times when it doesn't make complete sense all of the
steps you take on your journey to your ideal life are a success and lead you to
greater confidence and gratitude all of your thoughts are positive in
your mind here are these positive affirmations as your own beliefs hear
them as truth in this present moment

I am positive at all times
I fill my mind with only good thoughts and good feelings
I am calm

[Music] I choose to live in alignment with my
intentions
come back to the sensations in your body with a relaxed awareness
you feel as if the weight of tension has been lifted and released from your body
you sense that you are feeling lighter now almost as if you are floating and
gravity has let go of its effects on you
[Music] you feel as if you are a bird soaring
and drifting on a breeze in the sky
with this lightness in your body comes the letting go of anything weighing on
you both physically and emotionally
it is lifted completely out of your body
and this release allows you to feel lighter physically and drift into a more
productive sleep to prepare you for the day ahead
[Music]
let go of any tension weighing you down
[Music] let go of any pain you may be attached
to unknowingly [Music]

rejuvenation of a deep night's sleep to come

[Music]
and now you have prepared your mind and your body for a full productive night's
sleep you are confident and you are aligned
with your intentions
and now you feel sleep is inviting you to let go and surrender to your dreams
allow this to happen if you wish take
the final steps into a deep restful slumber
allow this dreaming sleep to heal your body and rejuvenate your mind to be the
best you can be

productive deep sleep [Music]
as you drift off into serene peaceful rest my voice will gradually disappear
and you will be deeply asleep

and completely rejuvenated
