hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this guided meditation
designed to help you ease into a deep and peaceful sleep while lowering your
blood pressure naturally and effectively
through mindfulness conscious breathing and deep body visualizations this
meditation will create an inner experience of relaxation as well as
guide the heart towards a healthy smooth and steady rhythm over the next short
while allow my voice to guide you into
this deep state of relaxation knowing that the hearts flow will follow suit as
you sing further into stillness
before we begin ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of
any required alarms should be set and nothing else should remain on today's
to-do list [Music]
take some time now to settle into a comfortable lying down position using
any blankets and cushions to support your body where needed if possible on
the spine and neck should be in line to help open the flow of energy through the
entire body tune in to your entire body
now as you make any final adjustments that will support your progression into
a deeply relaxed and peaceful state
I invite you now to simply bring your attention to your breath
without trying to shift it in any way just gently open your awareness to it
observing its natural flow rhythm and depth
[Music]
notice the way the breath comes and goes on its own accord
guided by innate wisdom that does not require any effort on your part it
simply comes and goes
just as the ocean eps and flows
[Music]
as you draw awareness to the breath notice if it naturally shifts in any way
again there is no need to intervene or manipulate its rhythm but you may find
that as you tune into the breath it might naturally deepen slow down or
adjust itself in some other way just
[Music] notice if this is true for you and also
notice if it is not there is no right or wrong way to notice the breath simply
observe it however it comes and follow it wherever it flows
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
throughout this meditation the mind may entangle itself in thoughts of the past
or in visions of what might come to be if for when it does simply acknowledge
this tendency as a movement away from this present moment before drawing your
attention back to the breath if thoughts
arise simply witness them for a moment with compassion and non judgment before
returning to your unchangeable Center
no matter how frequently they crop up no that is entirely normal for thoughts
to rise and entirely possible to gently
let them go use the breath as your
anchor at any point during this meditation to reground yourself in the
physical place that you rest
[Music]
draw your awareness now to the stomach
noticing its natural rise and for as breath moves through you
in our busy day to day activities we often breathe primarily from the chest
restricting our breaths range of movement this shallow breathing engages
our stress response and releases a surge of hormones that temporarily increase
our blood pressure [Music]
as we naturally expand the breaths movement moving it effortlessly into the
stomach we activate the relaxation response this deeper breathing pauses
out of an inner state of stress and
helps us to sink effortlessly into stillness and soon into a state of deep
sleep
continue to focus your attention on the stomach noticing just how far the breath
can go [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
take a moment now to acknowledge this physical place you are in
without engaging the Mayans and our living capacity is it possible to simply
witness the space you occupy to witness
the physical world you are intimately connected to
[Music]
notice the service that supports you and notice any soft textures around you
draw your awareness to this very simple moment knowing that there is nowhere
else you need to be you are nowhere else
but right here right now and all that is
asked of you is that you open your heart and awareness to this beautiful moment
before you fall into a deep and restorative sleep
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
as you notice your physical surrounds you may also become more deeply aware of
your physical body maintain awareness of
the breath flowing through you as you begin to scan the body gently starting
up the toes and traveling up to the crown of your head
[Music]
[Music]
there is nothing you need to look for in this process
he was simply called to witness whatever exists within you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
if any tension or discomfort appears in your awareness simply embrace it with
your loving awareness and open your breath up to this area that is calling
for your tender love and care if there
are no strong sensations to notice simply grant your entire body with your
compassionate attention and let it melt further into stillness
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] feel entirely free to also make any
physical adjustments to your positioning that will help to provide you with more
comfort if you adjust yourself at any
point during this meditation simply do so
mindfully and slowly to help foster this
growing sense of peace and serenity
inhale as you make any movements and
exhale deeply as you settle in to any new positioning
[Music]
[Music] hold your physical body in your
awareness now as you begin to envision it's sinking deeper and deeper into the
surface beneath you or tension is
invited to melt away and all muscles are
invited to relax completely with each
inhalation you are infused with the greatest sense of relaxation and with
each exhalation you release any lingering knots of tension or stress
just take a few deep breaths here
[Music] envisioning this process that is moving
through you inhale relaxation and exhale
any remaining tension in the body or mind
[Music]
[Music]
I invite you now to draw your awareness to the heart space and to invite your
breath into it breathe slowly and
steadily here filling the heart
completely on each inhalation and
softening it on each exhalation
[Music]
come to notice the steadiness of the heart space it's slow flow and its
openness as you breathe you bring the
heart into greater harmony and equilibrium
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] to slow down even more and to further
this process of relaxation begin to add counts of four to your breath on your
next inhalation breathe in to a slow counter for
pause for a brief moment at the top and then exhale for a full count of four
take three full breath cycles here following this guidance if it feels
comfortable to you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
envision the heart slowing its pace and
vision it relaxing completely into this moment it is beating naturally and
effortlessly without you needing to
intervene in any way simply by slowing
the breath the heart follows suit simply
by engaging in mindful breathing mind body and heart all come closer to
complete relaxation
as you settle into a sense of the heart beating slowly and steadily start to
expand your field of awareness by imagining the pathways that flow into
and away from the heart
[Music] envision the life force that travels
through your heart pumping smoothly and effortlessly this life force your blood
nourishes your cells as it flows steadily through your body
know that without any effort without any
force or manipulation the body is
nourishing itself in this very moment
open your heart a little bit further with each full breath
knowing that you are being supported by the body's innate wisdom right now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
continue to expand the breath envisioning and traveling throughout the
entire body
where attention goes energy flows [Music]
as you expand your awareness to encompass the entire physical body life
force in all its forms follow in that direction
[Music]
watching the breath flow steadily know that your blood is traveling in the same
manner effortlessly extensively and
wholeheartedly as you sink further into
stillness trusting the body's wisdom
[Music]
the heart continues to beat slowly and steadily without any effort required on
your part there is nothing you need to
do and nothing you need to fix in this
very moment your body is in harmonious
flow
[Music]
begin to gently release everything held in the mind any visions thoughts or any
mental chatter that may have crept up release it all on your next exhalation
[Music] as you let go gently imagine the mind
dropping down to the heart space
slowly unfastening itself from the headspace passing through the space
between your brows down the nose through
mouth and throat and landing softly in the heart
[Music]
without creating any visions thoughts or feelings of what this looks like simply
hold your awareness in the heart and explore what it feels like to be in this
space continue to breathe deeply through
the heart [Music]
[Music]
in a moment we will enter into a few moments of silence you may choose to
retain your breath as your anchor and focus for these moments or if it suits
you you may introduce the following information on each inhalation as we
sink into silence you may quietly repeat to yourself I am
flowing and on each exhalation you may
repeat I am releasing I am flowing
I am releasing I am flowing
I am releasing invite this affirmation
into your heart now or simply continue to breathe from the heart with your
awareness focused on your breath
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now gently release the affirmation if it is
currently passing through you with each breath and come back to the steady
rhythm of your heart exactly as it is
let go of all effort or focus and any
visions that may still be moving through you as you come quietly into pure
beingness as you slowly drift into sleep
there is nothing you need to carry with you so begin to shed any remaining
thoughts now simply practice for a few
more moments this art of pure being
[Music]
let each part of the body soften as you
allow this physical space to support your journey into sleep
[Music] allow the gentle flow of music to rock
you into a deep slumber
until you finally come to sleep for the night
continue to breathe deeply and slowly
allowing your breath to guide your hearts flow and guide you into a state
of tranquillity know that the body's
wisdom will continue to support and nourish you throughout the night and
that you were deeply supported by the energy flow that makes this life
possible [Music]
