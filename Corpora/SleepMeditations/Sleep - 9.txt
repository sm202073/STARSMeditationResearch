hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will help you to visualize yourself
achieving the weight loss or physique that is of your highest intent my name is jason stevenson
and i invite you to open your mind and this meditation will help to inspire
you to achieve the physical body that feels perfect for you and to help you sleep
well to begin this meditation just bring yourself to a comfortable resting
position and ensure that all end-of-day activities are taken care of
and that you are fully supported by whatever pillows or blankets you might need
close your eyes if you've not already done so and just take a few moments to ground yourself
through the natural rhythm of your breathing
you don't need to change the breath in any way yet for now simply let it flow in
and out as it yearns to be in this moment considering it to be an anchor for your
awareness notice what parts of your body rise and fall as you breathe
as well as any other physical sensations that you observe
[Music]
now softening the belly and seeing if your breath might naturally deepen
as you shift your awareness further down into your body [Music]
and i invite you to imagine each breath extending beyond both lungs and belly to awaken each
and every cell of your being let each and every inhalation breathe
itself into your whole body
with each of these full body breaths imagine that every in-breath brings vitality and
aliveness to your cells and that each breath out frees you of
stagnation or lethargy
so feeling into the stillness yet radiant vitality
of your body in this moment
and now before we move into a visualization to help us manifest our greatest aspirations for the physical
body let's take some time now to hone our attention on specific energy centers within your
body as we draw our attention through the body we will awaken the major energy points
within it that help us to achieve this new physical reality so begin now by drawing your
attention to the base of your spine to the root of your being
with your awareness held here at the root chakra let each breath in fill this part of you
with a renewed sense of connectedness to the physical world
to the earth beneath you and to your very own body
you are grounded connected and full of vitality
now let your awareness shift slowly to the navel as you hold your attention on your core
let each breath in create an expansion here filling you with confidence will power
and determination to achieve your dreams
you are strong resilient and empowered
let your inward gaze now move away from the core as it lands in the heart space in the
center of your chest
and as you hold your attention here on the heart let each breath awaken your sense of
self-love and unconditional worthiness
you are loved worthy and wonderful
and slowly now shift your awareness to your third eye to the center of your forehead and just
slightly higher than your brow line
and as you hold your awareness here let each inhalation awaken your capacity for
inspired imagination as well as your ability to intuit
what your body requires in any moment
you see and believe in your highest potential you know what your body needs
and now allow your attention to land on the crown of your head the top of your head
let each inhalation rise to fill this part of your being
and as it does allow it to fill you with a deep connection to the limitless energy of
this world whatever you require to achieve the physical state you long for
the universe can provide it
you are connected supported and ready for transformation
now let your focus open up as you come back to full awareness of your body
now in your mind's eye i invite you to envision that you are standing on a warm and sandy beach
gazing across azure blue waters
and behind you staggering amber cliffs rise up towards the sky
the contrast between the bright blue waters and this rich orange earth is
mesmerizing you revel in the beauty and wonder of this space
and as you turn back towards the sea you take a few moments to ground
yourself into the place that you occupy
through the soles of your feet you ground yourself into the soft sand and earth that supports you
that provides you with vital earthly energy
[Music] and through the crown of your head you
connect with the limitless potential of the universe your mind is beginning to expand to let
all possibilities filter into your awareness
[Music] the upward moving energy from the earth
meets with the downward moving energy from the cosmos landing in the center of your heart
and grounding you in love these energies meet in the heart to
ensure that all actions you take are rooted in and reflective of self-care
self-kindness and self-love
so take a few long deep breaths as you harness the energy above
below and all around you
and after your last long exhale let the breath come back to its natural
rhythm as you envision yourself moving down the coastline
how you move down this beach is entirely up to you perhaps you walk with grace run with
strength dance with full expression or move in some other way that your body
feels called to move in
whatever mode of movement helps you to feel strong and stable in your body
envision yourself flowing effortlessly along the sandy beach before you you are
deeply attuned to the needs and wishes of your body in this moment
note what it feels like to move in this way take this time to observe what feelings
and sensations arise
how does your body look as you move how does it feel to move with strength
confidence and agility
spend just a few more moments allowing yourself to move in a way that inspires you
until soon the beach begins to narrow as it reaches its northernmost end
[Music] from where you stand at the tip of this beach
you realize you have two options to go back to the place you started at
or to venture onwards and up
you choose the latter and so you decide to climb the rock face that leads
gradually up towards the peak of these majestic cliffs
you follow a small foot trail that takes you a few meters up from the beach
and that is where the work begins step by step you make your way up the
mountainous terrain with confidence and strength your body is fully engaged and your mind
is radiant and alive
with each step you take you shed any and all limiting beliefs that hold you back
from achieving your fullest potential
your body too sheds any excess weight that no longer serves you
or it builds the muscle the natural strength that you have long been yearning to
cultivate perhaps it does both
you feel and empowered to achieve the perfect body for yourself
you are beginning right here right now
notice how it feels to exert yourself in this way to absorb the energy of the earth
the sky and the sun and to propel yourself forward with vitality you are fully
alive relish in what this feels like
soon the incline decreases in intensity as you approach the highest plateau of
the cliff face as your movements slow and require less of your energy
you come back to the rhythm of your breath
breathing slowly and deeply you take your last few steps towards the highest
lookout point of this mountainous terrain from where you stand you can see the
shoreline extending for miles and miles and the sea drifting into the horizon
the water azure blue by the shore slowly fades into a deep and mysterious
darkness you are in awe with the beauty of this landscape
as you gaze out across the ocean you realize that anything is possible
you see this infinite world of possibility reflected in your own mind and spirit
confident in your ability to achieve whatever it is you long for
and with your feet grounded in the rich earth beneath you you stand tall and strong
fully grounded in this body that carries you through life
a deep sense of gratitude for your physical body moves through you
and so you thank it for its wisdom support and resilience
you take just a few more moments to gaze out across the vast sea below you
and as you turn around to find a comfortable place to rest your body
you were surprised to find a mirror has appeared from seemingly nowhere
it stands on the pathway that leads down to the grassy valley below
slowly you make your way towards the mirror mindful step by step
and as you reach it your eyes widen at the reflection you see
in the mirror it is your perfect self a glimmering you
embodying a physical body that makes you feel alive confident and radiant
take a moment to scan yourself in the mirror admiring the perfection of your physical
form and notice the way you glisten
and then deepen your gaze as you focus in on what radiates out from within
your confidence your happiness your vitality and aliveness
you are supremely beautiful both inside and out
just take a few more moments to revel in this radiant image of yourself
knowing that this self will move with you even when the mirror is gone you feel confident to
step away from it for now and as you pass it by taking the pathway
that leads down to the lush green valley below feel a deep sense of self-appreciation
warmth and tenderness rise up within you you sense that your mind spirit and body
are in full alignment now and so you are ready to rest deeply for a while
[Music] your feet carry you to a bright valley
and there you find a picnic blanket and a place to rest your head for a while
you lower yourself down to the earth resting flat on your back
as you gaze up at the blue sky and scattered white clouds
thinners cotton above you the sun has disappeared from your view
slowly departing for the day to grace another place on this earth
hours pass by and soon the sky transforms to orange and purple
and then to a deep midnight blue the full moon rises and the stars
too
and as you gaze up at these planetary neighbors you feel called to set an intention
to commit yourself to nourishing and supporting your physical body and all the ways it yearns to be
cherished take a moment now to set this intention
for your physical appearance and well-being in your words in your mind
repeating it to the cosmos three times in silence
the stars continue to glisten reflecting the beauty and radiance that is very much
alive within you and soon your eyes grow tired
your body heavy you scan your body from head to toe letting each body part
you pass surrender into the supportive
earth
and as you close your eyes to the night the visualization of this natural
landscape dissipates you come back to the place that holds
you by feeling into the supportive surface beneath you
just let your entire body relax slowly surrendering completely into
sleep you may use your breath as an anchor
once again to keep you grounded and present and simultaneously i invite you to allow
the following affirmations to fill your consciousness
and as they do they will continue to inspire your
physical transformation empowering you through positive beliefs
so let go of all effort now as you allow your subconscious mind
to take these affirmations in
