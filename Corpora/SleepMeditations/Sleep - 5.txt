hello and welcome to this short
guided meditation to help you start your
day on the right note
by setting an intention and visualizing
how you would like your day to unfold
to begin this practice take a moment to
find a comfortable
seated position
and however you find yourself seated
elongate your spine as if your crown of
the head is touching up towards the
morning sun
and allowing your shoulders to drop and
your chest
to open gently
closing your eyes if you haven't already
done so and then take a few moments to
check in with your natural ebb and
flow of your breathing
and just notice if there's any
restrictions or
contraction that is inhibiting your
breath from flowing
into the fullness of your lungs
and where it is possible for you to
consciously shift this
see where you might invite increased
softness or
surrender into your physical body
[Music]
you might relax the belly
the jaw or your shoulders
to facilitate the flow of this life
force
and now before we begin our intention
setting and
visualization practice let's just take
three
long deep breaths together
and begin by emptying your lungs all of
it
and take a full deep breath into the
belly for a count of
four
pause for a second at the top and then
slowly let it go for a count of four
another slow deep breath in
brief pause at the top and then
completely
release as you breathe out
one more full deep nourishing breath in
and brief pause and then release with a
soft
sigh as you exhale
and just let the breath continue to flow
naturally as it awakens you
to this day ahead
now i invite you to take a silent moment
to tune in with your heart as you
reflect upon
what intention you would like to set
for your day
it might be to move forward with courage
and confidence
to be loving and compassionate with
those you interact with
maybe to feel grounded and centered in
your being
or anything else that feels true to your
most authentic
self this morning
[Music]
and whatever it is take a moment
to silently formulate that intention
into a single sentence
and then silently repeat it to yourself
slowly
with heartfulness and commitment
and know that there is no right or wrong
intention to set
so you don't have to overthink it just
let whatever arises from within your
heart
and be led by that
now with this intention in mind
and with your commitment to embody it in
each minute
an hour that unfolds i invite you to
visualize your next
few steps upon finishing this meditation
where will you go next and what energy
will you travel with there
how will your body and mind feel as you
move through the morning
with your intention radiating out from
within you
picture how you will stand how you will
walk
what you will wear and which
qualities you will carry with you
and then follow your steps even further
into the future
what will your late morning look like
your lunch hour or your early afternoon
consider any interactions you will have
the effortless moments the potential
challenges
and the simple moments in between
picture yourself navigate all of these
moments with grace
ease and authenticity
as you visualize yourself moving through
the day
notice how it feels to be you
to be the you who lives in alignment
with your highest intent
let this energy embed itself in each
cell of your being
as you watch yourself effortlessly
moving forward
through the day
consider next how you will transition
into late
afternoon and evening what interactions
do you expect to have
if there are any obstacles you imagine
might cross your path
know that you have within you what it
takes to navigate these
as best as can be done let your
intention and the vision of your higher
self
guide your steps forward
spend just a few final moments
visualizing
any important details about the day
ahead
and then empower these visions with
trust faith
and confidence in yourself and in your
[Music]
intention
[Music]
and when you are ready slowly let the
imagery dissolve as you come back to
your breathing
watch the breath as it flows through the
heart space
and from the heart i invite you to
silently repeat
the following words i move
forward in alignment with my highest
intent
[Music]
i move forward in alignment with my
highest
intent
[Music]
i move forward in alignment with my
highest
intent
and now just take three long deep
breaths to close this practice
[Music]
and after that last breath whenever you
are ready
you can slowly open your eyes to the day
and as you move forward let your
intention
and your highest visions empower the
hours to come
thank you for your time
