hello and welcome to the mindful movement this is Sara Raymond with a
guided sleep meditation and relaxation that is designed to help you tap into
your innate ability to heal your own body this includes a relaxing full-body
scan and sleep-talk down followed by
suggestions for your subconscious to help increase your healing energy power
by utilizing visualization techniques and positive thoughts you will be
connecting to your energy source which
has more power to heal your body than you could ever imagine
our bodies know how to heal we just need to facilitate a positive
environment for it to do so that means eating healthy being active and managing
our stress through proper levels of sleep and other relaxing activities such
as this guided meditation to continue to
build on this sleep meditation listen to our shorter version in the morning or
afternoon there is a link to this video in the description
and now to begin find a comfortable position so your body
can fully relax and prepare for a peaceful healing night's sleep
make sure all distractions are turned off and you are in a safe environment to
drift off to sleep when you are ready and now I welcome you to allow your eyes
to close down gently and bring your
awareness to your breath for the next
several slow and deep breath cycles
invite a sense of complete relaxation into your body
take a deep inhale through your nose
hold it in for a few seconds and then
exhale fully through your nose or mouth
when you inhale inhale with the intention to honor your body on each
inhale you are bringing your body the oxygen it needs for all its many
functions
after each inhale when you hold your breath in be grateful for your ability
to take time to care for yourself be
grateful you can recognize what your body needs and provide it
as you exhale let your entire body relax
let your body sink into the surface below you letting go of all negative
thoughts that no longer serve you
be patient at the end of your exhale
letting your exhale finish releasing all
of your fear releasing all of your
anxiety all of your worry
and all of your pain and suffering
no need to name or connect with that pain and suffering simply let it go
[Music]
continue this for a few more cycles
knowing wholeheartedly that you are exactly where you need to be along your
journey
be patient with this relaxation process as each breath takes you step-by-step
further and further down into relaxation
slowly allow your breath pattern to normalize
notice how relaxed you have become
as your nervous system shifts
toward a more parasympathetic state you allow for greater healing potential from
within [Music] remember your body has all of the tools
it needs to heal itself you just need to
facilitate the right environment
[Music] relaxing your body allows it to recognize what areas need attention so
it can bring energy to what is needed
take a moment and scan over your physical body for any remaining points
of tension focus on those areas and on
your next exhale release any tension you may have
repeat as needed for the next few breaths
[Music] just keep letting go further and further
feel yourself settling into such a relaxed State
it's as if every cell in your body
has a sense of contentment every cell
has its own soft smile
[Music] an inner sense of well-being and health
is beginning to cultivate from deep within
[Music] wellbeing is your natural state
it's where your body wants to be
in a moment I will guide you to more slowly scan your body once more with the
intention to send positive healing energy to each part each muscle each
bone each nerve
each organ and every cell in your body
we will start from the top of your head and move all the way down through your
body to your feet
as you see each part of your body in your mind's eye and by a feeling of
relaxation into that body part
feel a sense of peace and calm from inside of your building
imagine this feeling as a light that is already inside of your body and with
time and intention it grows
as you scan your body for any areas of tension tightness or pain linger on any
body part that might need healing
intentionally bring your healing light
into that area to soften it
this warm loving light will melt the tension away from your body and allow
you to fully relax
see the tension melting away leaving
your body and going down into the surface below you to be gone from your
body forever
as you continue scanning your body feel this loving energy move through your
entire body as it takes you deeper and
deeper into a safe and supported state
of relaxation
allow this light to build and
progressively relax you
bring your attention lightly to your forehead and feel it soften and smooth
then your eyebrows and eyes melt as this
warm soothing light builds gently inside
of you
the tiny muscles around your eyes release
feel your eyelids becoming very heavy
you part your teeth unclench your jaw
and relax your tongue [Music]
you feel your throat softening
you might feel a light tingling sensation in the body or a floating
sensation that comes and goes
it might even feel as if you are becoming this light
as if there is no difference between where you end and where this light
begins whatever you're feeling is
perfect and you just observe the feelings and
sensations as you allow yourself to
enjoy this time for you and to go within
notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper
and deeper [Music]
feel the tension melting out of your
shoulders and moving down your arms and
flowing out of your body through your fingertips
with each breath your chest and abdomen
begin to feel heavy and you are fully
supported and protected by this healing
light
this light circles and lingers around your heart
and builds your body's ability to heal itself
the building light begins to move down your body releasing any tension from
your lower back and hips
your thighs feel heavy and sink down
your knees soften and your calves melt
as your body continues to rest heavy your ankles and feet let go of any
remaining tension that your body may feel to be completely relaxed safe and
supported
you feel this warm healing light as it
passes over your body it takes away all
the physical and emotional stress
and supports you it allows you to
recover more productively as you rest
your body has everything it needs to heal simply encourage it and allow it to
happen
now I would like to invite you to take a journey with me through your imagination
imagine a beautiful location somewhere
with nature on a grand scale
it can be somewhere you have been before or somewhere that exists only in your
imagination it could be a beach a forest
or perhaps a mountain range
anything that resonates well in your mind
take a moment now and scan the horizon
observe all that there is to take in
see the colors off in the distance
the textures of the ground beneath your feet
you can't help but be overwhelmed with the beauty around you
your body is part of this universal beauty you are connected to everything
around you
everything is energy and there are no real gaps
the same energy that creates this amazing setting as part of you
it holds a timeless perfection
you gaze up at the sky and the colors are just perfect
a few fluffy clouds amongst an endless view of bright blue sky above
you look ahead and you notice a figure in the distance
with a sense of safety and peace you begin to walk towards this image and you
realize that it is a person and they are
walking towards you
as you approach this person you begin to
realize that it's you this person is
your higher self you can see clearly

radiating from their heart spreading infinitely in all directions

is right in front of you now it's your higher-self radiant with this
healing light
