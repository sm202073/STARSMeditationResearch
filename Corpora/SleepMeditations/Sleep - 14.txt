[Music]
hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will help you to
effortlessly wind down and to fall asleep quickly by consciously inviting
relaxation into your body and mind and by using the power of visualization you
will soon enter a deeply relaxed state that is conducive of a solid night's
slumber my name is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to follow me on this journey
as you slowly surrender to sleep I
invite you now to begin drawing your attention to your physical body and making any adjustments necessary to
facilitate relaxation use any cushions
or blankets you need for warmth or support and also ensure that any
distracting lights are turned off and that your blinds are drawn
[Music]
see if you can comfortably form one straight line from tailbone to neck and
then let your limbs relax wherever they are comfortable close your eyes if
you've not done so and take a few slow and steady breaths to settle in
[Music]
as we move through this meditation know that there is nothing you need to achieve or accomplish simply let these
words flow effortlessly through you use them to ground your attention if the
mind wanders away into less than settling thoughts now let us begin by
practicing some deep belly breathing to help us shift further into the body's
rest and digest state of being so begin by drawing your
attention to the stomach perhaps placing a hand there if you like
and after your next full exhalation take
a deep breath in letting the belly expand as the air enters into you hold
the breath at the top for just a second and then slowly let the air back out
through the pursed lips just watching the belly fall when you reach the bottom
hold the air out for just a second or two and then take another full deep
breath in so continue to breathe in this
way for just a few moments on your own letting each inhalation and each
exhalation belong letting the belly rise and fall with each cycle and also
allowing for a second pause at the end of each in-breath and each out breath
[Music]
continue breathing this way for a short while longer letting your attention
ground in the sensation of breathing [Music]
and after your next exhalation allow your breath to resume its natural depth
pace and rhythm
[Music]
note what it feels like to be in your body now observing any shifts that you
may have already experienced
remember that during meditation when you are invited to note your experience
there is nothing expected of you just simply allow your experience to be what
it is in this moment trusting that everything is moving you towards a
greater state of harmony
[Music]
and take a moment now to draw your attention to the physical body noting
any areas of unconscious contraction
it is not uncommon to hold tension in the brow in the shoulders in the belly
or in your hips and so as you observe
the fullness of your body in this moment see where you might be able to soften to
surrender more completely to the earth beneath you [Music]
if there is tension or discomfort that cannot be consciously relaxed I invite
you to instead send that area a few loving words of support
you might even silently ask what part of
me is calling for attention here bless
whatever aspect of mind or body comes to your awareness by sending it your
kindness and care
[Music]
now in just a moment we'll begin a soothing visualization that will help
you to wind down even further but before we do just take a moment to notice the
surface that hold you notice the
stillness of your body and the support of the physical world
just open yourself up to the beauty of this simple quiet moment before we
transition in the realm of inspired imagination
[Music]
now I invite you to begin visualizing that you are standing in a wide-open
enchanted corridor with windows lining the wall to your right
[Music] the high ceiling above you boasts a floral mural peach violet and gold
flowers intertwined with vines decorate the space overhead the hallway feels
majestic as if you are in an old palace that time has forgotten old pieces of
artwork lined the walls and yet you know the space is well-kept as there are no
signs of dust or debris it is well kept in your mind at the very least
[Music] and off to your right through the
expansive windows that line the corridor you peer out over crystal waters a sea
extends as far as the eye can see the
skies clear birds frolic in the sky and
the waves are caressing the shore the
Sun is slowly setting upon this peaceful land casting a dark pink light across
the horizon yearning to smell the sea
breeze you crack open a window and take a full deep nourishing breath in and you
let it back out [Music] another deep salty breath in through the
nostrils and then slowly release once
again [Music] each breath of this fresh air cleanses
you purifying body mind and soul
[Music]
you step away from the window now curious as to where this corridor might
lead you the world outside is beautiful and inspiring you long for a deep and
nourishing rest and so you decide to head out in search of a place to lay
your head you turn away from the window
now and slowly make your way down the corridor your feet tread lightly you are
completely aware of each moment you make [Music]
you carry on down the hallway pausing as you reach a closed door at the end above
the doorway there is a sign that reads to the cave of peace something settles
within you simply upon reading this sign and so you slowly reach out your hand to
pull open the door just on the other
side an enchanted spiral staircase presents itself undoubtedly leading you
down towards the cave of peace below the
number 10 is etched in gold on the stone wall of the staircase suggesting you are
ten flights up from the earth below you take a moment to prepare for the descent
admiring the smooth stone walls the marble staircase and the gold-plated
hand railing that spirals effortlessly downwards you take a deep breath in and
out and then you begin taking the twisting
steps towards the ninth floor as you
reach the landing of the ninth floor you feel a weight fall from your shoulders
all the worries of the day have been released and you feel yourself breathing
deeper easier than you did before you arrived here as your shoulders drop away
from your ears your heart space opens you feel light and free after a full
mindful breath you carry on towards the eighth floor gliding graciously down the
marble steps [Music]
when you arrive on this next landing you feel your jaw drop and your brow relaxed
your head space begins to feel lighter as you open more fully to this journey
of deep release taking a full deep
breath in and out
and then you carry on slowly down the staircase taking your time to reach the
seventh floor landing
[Music] when you arrive there you feel a wave of
gratitude wash over you you feel grateful for the air that nourishes you
for the space that holds you and for the beauty that lives within you silently
thank the universe for all that you were blessed with
after another mindful breath you carry on down the staircase pausing when you
reach the sixth floor
[Music] here on the sixth floor you take a
moment to tune into your heart and are flooded with the sense of embodied
self-love self-care and self compassion
something within you awakens to your own divinity and in response you feel a deep
sense of appreciation for who you are exactly as you are you take another
moment to revel in this sense of self appreciation before continuing on down
the marble staircase [Music]
as you come to reach the fifth floor something within you whispers for you to
let go perhaps it is a belief you've been holding on to that no longer serves
you or a worry you've been carrying too heavily
[Music] whatever within you might be ready to
depart breathe it out with a deep exhalation before continuing down
towards the fourth floor [Music]
you'll and gracefully on the fourth floor landing and as you do you are
overcome with a sense of deep trust in the universe you realize that every
single step you've taken in this life has brought you to where you are now and
where you are now here in this enchanted staircase is serving you in countless
ways you trust that this is exactly
where you were meant to be and after taking a mindful breath here you
continue your descent [Music]
soon you reach the third floor where something within you whispers this
moment is enough this moment is enough
[Music]
you pause here grounding your two feet into the solid floor beneath you you
peer out through a window that overlooks the sea just beyond these walls and your
heart opens even wider to embrace the peace and simplicity of this moment yes
you think to yourself this moment is enough
continuing the descent you move your feet again allowing them to carry you
gracefully to the landing below as you
arrive on the second floor you pause yet again full presence comes to you now
there is nothing you seek nothing you are grasping at and while yes
some part of you longs to rest completely by dozing off into slumber
there is no anxiety in you about it you
know that you will arrive there very soon and that it will be this peaceful
present energy that assists you in getting to that state with ears
two more flights to go and so you continue your journey towards the first
floor landing as you arrive on the main
floor you feel completely and deeply grounded fully aware of your connection
to the earth beneath and around you you know that you are well rooted in this
life and in this moment you feel centered stable and supported
a sign by the top step of the next set of stairs reads to the cave of peace and
so you take a full deep breath once again then you make your way step by
step to that final floor just beneath the earth
and as you step off that final stair you
find yourself in a wide-open room that is indeed cave-like and lit with candles
it is the most elegant cave you have ever seen majestic in its outfit
a splendid rug the color of mole breeze and the Tuscan Sun covers much of the
floor off to the side a four-poster bed
sits elegantly it is adorned with plush cushions and blankets that cause you
towards it and yet before you go you
take a moment to admire the quietude of this space the simplicity the elegance
and the comfort
the candle light soothes your soul as it flickers against the walls of the cave
[Music]
and now ready to rest your head you take
a moment to gently blow out all of the candles in the room leaving the one next
to your bed for last
[Music] you make your final preparations for
sleep and then you crawl into the cozy bed before you when you are settled you blow
out the last remaining candle and sink into the darkness of this room your body
rejoices at the comfort of this place you have found yourself in it feels well
supported and fully nourished in this abode the space is quiet cozy and
peaceful and so you prepare to let your entire body ease into a deep slumber
there's settle more completely you come back to your breath held safely in this
night you allow your belly to soften and the breath to flow as deep as it is
comfortable to
with each breath ian you feel a sense of universal love and support entering you
and with each breath out you free yourself of any tension that no longer
serves you [Music]
your breath resumes its natural pace now as you draw your attention to the top of
your head as you hold this space in your
awareness you send it your love and invite it to relax as you exhale gently
your attention shifts towards the space between your eyebrows and in the same
way you witness love and ease this part
of you through your presence and through your breath
[Music] you continue in the same way nourishing
your cheeks and your jaw
your tongue and your mouth softening
relaxing
[Music] and your throat and shoulders dropping
letting go [Music]
[Music] next you trace the length of your left
arm all the way to your fingertips inviting it to soften into the surface
beneath you
[Music] repeating the same on the opposite side
you allow your right arm to be seen and to relax completely you trace it from
the right shoulder all the way to your fingertips draw your attention now back
to the heart space holding this loving center of your being in full awareness
as you breathe into the heart watch it
expand and as you exhale from the heart
allowed to soften
your attention slowly shifts down your spine relaxing each vertebrae and the
surrounding muscles as you gently make your way towards your stomach and as you
hold your belly in your awareness you offer it your love and invite it to rest
for the night
you hold your pelvis and your hips and your loving awareness next breathing
into it and out of this space completely
and then slowly you draw this loving awareness down the left-leg inviting it
to relax in its entirety all the way
down to your toes [Music]
you then come back up to the right hip and slowly repeat this process of
softening as you scan the length of your right leg
all the way down to your toes
[Music]
now hold your entire body in your awareness letting each inhalation move
all the way into the farthest reaches of your being and each exhalation to soften
the entire body
[Music]
[Music] the body is relaxed the mind is relaxed
and now nothing stands between you and a
deep peaceful sleep [Music]
the envisioned room in your mind's eye dissolves as you realize you are once
again in the room that holds you physically and though you are no longer
in the cave of peace that once held you it has bestowed its energy upon each one
of yourselves it's peaceful presence remains with you
[Music] continue to mind your breath gently now
as you slowly allow yourself to sink into a deep and peaceful night's sleep
rest well my friend rest well
