welcome to this guided meditation my name is Jason Stevenson from relax me
online.com and I'll be taking you on this journey for the next few minutes
before we begin please make sure that you will not be disturbed whilst doing this relaxation and turn off all mobile
phones lay down now if you haven't already done so close your eyes and
relax wiggle a little if you have to get
comfortable real comfortable and on a breath in breathe in peace when you
breathe out feel a heaviness and allow your body to become heavy and relaxed
the more relaxed you become the heavier
you feel
and keep focusing on your breathing and breathe in with ease no tension no
trying just a natural easiness in and
out and notice that when you breathe out
you feel more relaxed feel your breath
travel down to your lungs fill your lungs right up hold the breath and now
let it all go blowing it all out as you blow out appreciate the relaxed easy
feel that you now feel
breathe normally now and as you do feel your neck shoulders and back relax
spread out and let go enjoy the process of this relaxation
shift your focus now to your stomach area your abdominal muscles tighten
these muscles and hold the breath for a few moments
and release letting go of all the stale air feel this area relax and feel at
ease feel the difference between tensing of
these muscles and how they feel when they relax repeat this process a few
times breathing in holding tensing the muscles
and release let go relax on your outward
breath and one more time
breathing in holding tensing the muscles
and let go release the breath
now you can move into a deeper state of relaxation simply by concentrating on relaxing each part of your body I'd like
you now to shift your focus to your feet both of your feet and feel them relaxed
from your toes and your ankles your feet become very relaxed moving up to your
calf muscles feel them become heavy relaxed
your feet and your calf muscles are now relaxed and focusing now on your knees
the front of your knees and behind your knees feel them let go and give way and
relax [Music]
moving up now to the thighs area the pelvis your buttocks area and you lower
back they become heavy now and relax now
your feet your ankles calf muscle Stiers
pelvis buttocks area it's all very relaxed [Music]
feel the heaviness now of your lower body from your pelvis area all the way
down to your toes deeply relaxed
focusing now on your upper back your stomach and chest all this part becomes
relaxed heavy feel it's sinking through
the floor very relaxed very heavy
and move that focus now to your shoulders your arms forearms your wrists
hands and fingers get a sense of the
whole of the arm right down to your fingertips now become very relaxed and
melt away
now moving that focus now up to your neck the top of your head facial muscles
all around your face your mouth your teeth cheeks the space between your
eyebrows every muscle in your face becomes relaxed and heavy and your
entire body is now relaxed and heavy
now I'd like you to locate your Center which again is focusing on your abdomen
area and imagine there is a ball of peace positioned right at your Center
slowly now with intention see the ball gently rolling and massaging your
abdomen area and it soothes each muscle
that it comes into contact with as the ball rolls around the ball now moves
from your Center to your right hip gently massaging and relaxing the
muscles of your hip as it comes into contact with these muscles massaging now
backwards and forwards all of these muscles
the ball continues now right down to your knee and around your
knee soothing and massaging any tension as the ball rolls around your knee you
can feel the tension melting away roll
the ball down now to your calf muscle your ankle and all the way down to your
foot and along your toes from your small toe along for your second third and
fourth and the ball comes to a stop on your big toe every place that ball comes
into contact with feel these muscles relax and melt away now feel the ball as
it begins to move and work its way up your leg again rolling massaging and
melting away the tension moving around your ankle calf muscle knee thigh
and coming right back up again to your Center your abdomen area from here the
ball moves along down now your left thigh massaging your thigh and your knee
massaging the back in front of your knee
with your mind you can move this ball wherever you choose and for however long
you may want it to be there so moving it around your knee and your calf muscle
ankle and again right down to your toes
starting with the small toe and gliding
up to your big toe so your thigh knee
carve ankle muscles foot muscles and all
the muscles in your toes and now very relaxed gently and smoothly massaging
the muscles as it goes
and now feel that ball roll back up your
leg past your calf muscle your knee thighs and arriving back at your Center
shift the focus now of the ball and as
it moves now to the base of your spine your spinal cord allow the ball to rest
there and then it begins to move up your spine it pauses near your heart and you
can actually feel it massaging the internal organs and all the arteries and capillaries of your heart
[Music]
the ball now travels up to your throat area and outside of your neck area
relaxing soothing massaging and
releasing any tension in your neck area the ball then travels along your
shoulder down your arm forearm and into
your wrist the palm of your hand and fingers you can feel it gently massaging
your fingers can't you move the
intention of the ball now to start rolling back up your arm shoulder and
neck and along to your other harm traveling down this arm past your elbow
forearm wrist and into the palm of this
hand allow it to gently massage your palm and fingers
finally the ball moves up your arm shoulder neck and as it reaches your
head and face the ball now splits into a thousand tiny balls feel them all
rolling around or your facial muscles
your eyes for it eyebrows cheeks chin mouth teeth
tongue massaging your face messaging every
muscle in your face around your eyes
caressing you enjoy this moment of a
facial massage
[Music]
now I'd like you to imagine as you're lying there your ceiling of the house is
now opening up sliding across to reveal
a clear dark bible black starry night
look up and see that beautiful night sky
the sky is clear the moon is out brightly lighting the
corner of the sky in short it is a magical peaceful night you are alone and
you are safe in the beautiful calmness of the night notice the multitude of
twinkling stars shining down on you and the soft dark night blanketing you in
warmth and peace with the Stars you see
some are millions of miles away
they're the dimly lit stars others the
closer ones are shining brightly down on you know that as you look into the night
you are looking deep into galaxy after galaxy beyond time beyond measure and
beyond what you can see are another million million other stars waiting for
you from another galaxy another time
take a deep breath in breathe in this
rich expanse of infinite planets stars and galaxies and feel yourself melt into
these stars become at one with them no
separation now you are a part of this wondrous galaxy
[Music]
as you expand you become a shooting star and fly right across the night sky in a
blaze of bright illuminating light and just like a memory you to fade into the
sky [Music]
since the unlimited boundaries of this space all walls are broken down as you
melt into the Cosmic Consciousness and at one you become you are living in the
moment of this wondrous illuminated starry sky there is no past no future
only now and you are all that is you are
the Stars you are the moon and you are every bit
of the space between the planets
[Music]
floating off now drifting away
as you become more at one with this expansive universe you feel your body
wanting to curl up within it to drift off
[Music] and so you allow it to happen
you feel at peace loved and a part of
the whole you are the or you are
everything you are
when you are ready begin to let go and drift off to sleep if you need to awaken
you will return to your waking life feeling at peace refreshed and ready to
face what you need to do if you are about to drift off you would drift off
into a most peaceful relaxed and wonderful sleep
and then this day
