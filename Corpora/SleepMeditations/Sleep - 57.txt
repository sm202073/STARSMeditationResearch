hello and welcome to this loving-kindness meditation prior to sleep my name is Jason Stevenson and I
will be taking you on this journey though this meditation was originally
used in Buddhism you don't have to be a Buddhist to make it work for you nor do
you have to subscribe to any religion or belief in Supernatural love and kindness
are wonderful things but often we feel anything but sometimes it's easier to
feel anger and hate but author Jonathan Lockwood who he also
known as the philosopher of happiness put it best when he said forgive others
not because they deserve your forgiveness but because you deserve peace now unfortunately that's often
easier said than done but fortunately this meditation can help you so let's
begin so please sitting upright but comfortably so if you'd like to rest
your back against something that's fine just don't slouch or lean back because doing so will affect your breathing and
if you want to lie down and do this before you drift off to sleep that's okay to just rest your hands palms face
up on your lap or or by your side if you're lying down now close your eyes
and focus on your breathing it's alright if thoughts and images come in so long
as you keep most of your attention on your breath you're doing fine when you see a thought
allow it to be don't try and push it down but you simply shift your focus
back to your breathing I want you to remember a time when you
did a kind thing for someone it doesn't have to be dramatic but I have two
conditions the first is that you did it without a thought of a reward or an
influence to that person and the second is that you didn't later regret what you
did just reflecting on that do you remember how it felt did it feel good
did you feel proud of yourself did it bring a smile to your face
[Music]
if you're smiling now that's all good that feeling stems from a core goodness
within yourself now I want you to try to remember what you looked like as a child
the younger the better that child you
were for all their faults and mischievousness deserved patience and
understanding that child you were also deserved loved could you see yourself
wanting to protect and provide for that child
[Music]
could you see yourself wanting to hold and comfort that child just explore this
thought for a moment
[Music]
you you
now if you can just mentally repeat after me for all the ways that I harm
myself negate doubt belittle myself
judge or be unkind to myself through my
own confusions I forgive myself and if
there is a situation I am not yet ready to forgive I forgive myself for that too
may I feel loving-kindness may I be
filled with loving-kindness may I be
held in loving kindness may I be happy
and peaceful may I appreciate the gift
of just being alive
[Music] I'd like you now to bring to mind someone you love dearly it could be a
parent a child a friend or even someone who's passed away
can you remember their faces how they
move [Music]
do you know why you love that person can you remember the things they did to earn
your love
how do you feel or how did you feel when they were around you what does your love
feel like to spend a few moments exploring this
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you
[Music] imagine there in front of you now and
mentally repeat after me if I have harmed you in any way either knowingly
or unknowingly through my own confusions
I ask your forgiveness if there is a
situation you are not yet ready to forgive me for I will be patient you
have harmed me too perhaps knowingly or unknowingly through your own confusions
but I forgive you and if there is a situation I am not yet
ready to forgive you for please be patient
[Music] may you feel loving-kindness may you be
filled with loving-kindness [Music]
may you be held in loving-kindness may
you be happy and peaceful may you
appreciate the gift of just being alive
[Music] now please try to hold on to that love
and think of someone you neither like nor dislike it could be your mailman a
co-worker or simply you see someone every day but have never spoken to
[Music]
can you remember their faces how they
move what they sound like if you've spoken to them now your love might be
weakening a little at the moment try to hold on to that love you felt for the other person as you picture this new one
[Music] what if you knew that this person has
children they love very much children they'd be willing to suffer for would
that change your feelings about them
consider that they may have pain and suffering but they might also want
happiness for themselves and those they love might that warm you toward them a
little imagine that they could be kind
to you if you gave them a chance does the thought of loving them with the same
intensity still seem strange can you imagine the possibility of it could you
fake it a little could you try to feel the love you felt for the other person
and keep this new person's face in mind just try to explore this thought over
the next few moments [Music]
[Music]
[Music] you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
mentally repeat after me may you feel loving-kindness may you be filled with
loving-kindness may be held in
loving-kindness may you be happy and
peaceful may you appreciate the gift of
just being alive whatever living beings
there may be may they all have happy minds may I not deceive another nor
despise anyone anywhere even when angry or upset
[Music] may I not wish ill upon another just as
the mother would protect her only child with her life even so mayor cultivate a
boundless love towards all beings may I
radiate boundless love towards the entire world unhindered without ill-will
without enmity I'd like you to go back
now and remember the person you love so much picture their faces and imagine that
they're with you remember what it feels
like when they're present and rest in that thought for the next few moments
[Music]
and now the hard part bring to mind
someone you dislike it doesn't matter
why you dislike or hate them but could even be someone you've never met
perhaps some public figure whose blood makes you boil for some other reason if
there's no such person in your life think of someone you've recently had a
spat with and are still upset with I'm
going to assume you've brought up someone you dislike let your emotions
come but don't try to justify them simply let the experience of dislike
come as your heart beat faster is a
dialogue now coming into your header along the lines of I should have said this or I should have done that focus on
your breathing but don't let the feelings go [Music]
you I want you to imagine what this person
you dislike might look like as a child long before they created whatever drama
it is that upsets you so much try to
create some emotional distance and imagine how they might act as a child
perhaps when they were three or four
[Music] visualize a small of them with a higher pitched voice and a face without
whatever expression that annoys you so much
[Music]
[Music] could you see yourself hating this imaginary child if this child were hurt
or upset could you see yourself wanting to pick them up
perhaps hugging them to give them some comfort if you saw this child alone and
scared could you see yourself walking away [Music]
[Music]
what could you see yourself putting aside your own feelings to comfort someone in the midst of their own pain
and suffering [Music]
now imagine this person as they are now if you saw them alone and scared
far away from wherever it is you have to interact with them if you saw them
vulnerable suffering and in pain and know that this is that same child you
would have comforted could you still dislike or hate them with the same
intensity or could you see yourself softening a little
[Music]
if you could see this person holding a little child tenderly perhaps comforting
that child could you see yourself softening a little more
could you be a little less angry or upset with such a person if you could
talk to the child this person was what would you say
[Music] you
you
[Music] mentally repeat after me if I have
harmed you in any way either knowingly or unknowingly through my own confusions
I ask your forgiveness if there is a
situation you are not yet ready to forgive me for I will be patient you
have harmed me too perhaps knowingly or unknowingly through your own confusions
but I forgive you
and if there is a situation I am not yet ready to forgive you for please be
patient may you feel loving-kindness
[Music] may you be filled with loving kindness
may you be held in loving kindness
may you be happy and peaceful may you
appreciate the gift of just being alive
whatever living beings there may be may
they all have happy minds
may our not deceive another nor despise anyone anywhere
even when angry or upset may I not wish
ill upon another [Music]
just as a mother would protect her only child with her life even so mayor
cultivate a boundless love towards all beings may I radiate boundless love
towards the entire world unhindered
without ill-will without em nity you can
stay with this meditation now for as long as you wish and if you still can't
let go then forgive yourself you can
always return to this exercise at another time [Music]
