[Music] welcome to this guided meditation visualization for sleep settle yourself
in bed make sure you addressed comfortably and
that you have set any alarm clock you may need in order to wake up tomorrow
morning turn off your cell phone and any other
electronic devices
and write down any tasks or appointments you need to remember upon awaking
allow yourself a moment to create a sleep atmosphere that is relaxing
peaceful and safe when you were ready
lay back against your pillow and let your eyelids slide shut feel the
darkness envelope you
notice the softness of the pillow behind your neck the way your sheets and
comforter rest against your whole body
allow yourself to let go of what you were thinking about just for a little
while right now your only job is to let
your body relax and your mind soften preparing you for a deep and restful
sleep
if you feel you need to roll over during this meditation let yourself do so this
is not the time to try to force your body and mind to your will now is a
chance to let go completely and enjoy the sense of peace and safety that only
sleep can bring so as we begin this
meditation let go of any preconceived
ideas of what falling asleep feels like and simply let yourself drift through
the sensations and ideas you encounter breathe in and exhale
let your breath flow in and out of your lungs relishing the sound and sensation
of air against the inside of your nose
when you listen a little closer you begin to realize how the air you breathe
sounds like the ocean washing over a beach covered in white sad imagine the
palm trees growing on the edge of this sand let yourself smell the delicate
scent of tropical flowers
feel away a warm breeze brushes across your cheeks blowing through your hair
ruffling your clothes above you fluffy
white clouds float past and you can hear
the chatter of birds off in the distance take it all in letting yourself sigh out
any stresses of the day as you begin to
notice the sights and sounds around you you start to sense where you are
you are laying on your back drifting slightly with the sound of the tired and
your own breath as you begin to notice
this gentle rocking motion you realize
that you are floating on your back in the turquoise waters of a tropical ocean
even as you realize this you feel totally peaceful secure in the knowledge
that no matter what happens you will not sink instead you can float here on your
back without any concerns or judgment
you are totally safe with each inhale
and pull of the tired you feel the warm water around you laugh at your tensions
and fears melting them ever so slowly
each new inhale melts some of the worry keeping your muscles stiff bringing your
body closer and closer to the gentle nurturing pull of the ocean feel the
tired warming your fingers and toes dissolving the tension from a long day's
work notice the way your limbs float and
move with the tempo of the sea around you you are like seaweed fluttering
gently in the soft in the spool of the current and your own
breath
allow the turquoise water reach your knees and elbows bringing warmth to achy
joints as you continue to breathe deeply
listening to the sound of your own exhalation and the oceans tides around
you allow the water to encompass your shoulders and hips supporting you from
below the ocean supports you from your
head to your toes allowing you to let go
of the force and willpower necessary to maintain your daily lifestyle here in
this ocean you can let yourself melt into the water drifting
drifting where it takes you and not worrying about the end result
as you take your next inhale the water
reaches your shoulders and belly feel
the way the grip of stress and tension evaporates at the touch of this calm
warm water let your concerns float
beside you for a moment but then allow them to dissolve into the
salt water your thoughts have served you well today
keeping you attentive and responsible
despite all this they too need a chance to rest so give them this opportunity to
do so
let yourself drift along noticing how
less and less of the tension surrounding your remains every breath you take melts
the thoughts and concerns around you until none are left
you are totally relaxed every muscle in
your body loose and pliable
take a moment to just enjoy the way it feels the way your fingers flutter in
the ocean's current like the tentacles of a drowsy jellyfish
as you relax more fully allow the water
to pull you out father to see every
breath you take touch you further from the shore and deeper into a sense of
serenity and the calm you are floating
in a warm gentle sea with absolutely no
concerns as you pass thoughts from your
day or worries about your future feel the way the water around you draws you
onward these tensions Bob on the surface
of the ocean but after only a few moments they to relax and sink into the
waters comforting embrace you are the
only thing for miles and you are totally free to move and drift wherever you
please
trail your fingers through the water feel the way there pressure against the
surface of the ocean leaves little ripples behind you let your hand drift
underneath the water for a moment and enjoy the way the tide pulls it water
undulating past your skin let the sea
wash through the hair at the nape of your neck erasing any tension you hold
there feel the way your body Bob's up
and down slightly as you pass through small soothing waves
allow your eyes to drift upwards and notice how the Sun is beginning to set
the sky is beginning to turn color scarlet streaks appearing against bright
blue as you watch daytime sky begins to
fade giving way to a brilliant mixture of pinks reds and oranges the Sun begins
to drift below the horizon a regal
sphere returning to its own place of rest as it sinks lower inky blue joins
the brighter colors soothing and calm
while you continue breathing you notice that although the Sun has
gone down the ocean around you remains warm and gentle rocking you gently
across its surface
in fact the darkness around you leaves you free to enjoy the relaxation and
aimlessness the water brings instead of
noticing the science around you you focus on the sensations in your limbs
let yourself drift further if any
thoughts or ideas come up allow the current around you to wash them off
observe them without worrying as you drift further and further into the
distance let the concerns you leave behind relax
to notice the way they sink into the
warm comfort of this tropical sea you
are cleansed of thoughts of worries of
tensions now you have the complete
freedom to let your mind and body relax as you rest in this soft current
if you notice yourself becoming distracted visualize the stars above you
watch the way they seem to move as you drift with the water almost as if they
too were being lulled into relaxation by the sound of your breath and the tired
feel the breeze brush against you carrying with the salty scent of the sea
and tropical plants allow the sounds of
birds animals to reach you their quiet cooing calming you as they
to settle down for the night in this place everything is calm every part of
the landscape beckons you reassuring you
helping you release all but the warm drifting pall of the water you are safe
as you enjoy the warmth around you the sounds and smells allow the ocean around
you to pull you deeper and deeper into a sense of relaxation and calm let
yourself be cleansed of every thought and ache by the relentless tug of the
ocean tide
he your breath the way matches the tempo
of the oceans pull and push above all
allow yourself the time to savor the peace and safety that this soothing
tropical place holds
as the stars twinkle above you you sink
into a plane of consciousness where only you and the ocean exist you are water
and the water is you
