let go of the overthinking overactive mind and enjoy a healing restful deep
sleep tonight whether your thoughts are in the past or the future an overthinking mind can
bring turmoil to your world even in your sleep tonight release these feelings
calm the overactive mind and experience peace in this present moment I will
guide you to focus on the present moment let go of worries about the past and
anxieties about the future and then relax your mind and body for a
powerfully deep night's sleep hello and welcome I'm Sara Raymond here at the
mindful movement we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner
peace positive mindset and the ability for self-healing and tonight I am
grateful to have the opportunity to help you experience pure blissful relaxation
and now I invite you to make yourself comfortable
settle in for this evening meditation and relaxation practice create a safe
and tranquil environment for yourself making sure you are all set to drift off
into sleep
make your room as dark as possible create the most comfortable environment
that you can feel free to pause this recording if you need to make any
further adjustments
now that you have prepared your surroundings and settled in for the night welcome a sense of relaxation and
peace into your mind and body close your
eyes and allow my voice to be your guide into relaxation invite in the sensation
of relaxation as if you are welcoming an old friend
take a deep inhale through your nose and
let out a relaxing sigh through your mouth
let your body sink into bed and make any
further adjustments necessary to become
as comfortable as possible
now take another slow deep breath in through your nose letting it out with a
sigh and sink down just a bit further into the surface below you you can drift
off into sleep when your body is ready there is no need to listen to everything
I say let relaxation and sleep come to you
easily welcoming a slowing down of the
momentum of your energy to gradually find stillness
now begin to count your breath in and as
you breathe out encourage your exhale to be one count longer than your inhale
allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress or
tension by exhaling longer than you
inhale your breath will slow and your body will calm down
continue breathing with an extended exhale for a few breaths cycles
now enjoy the easy flow of your natural breath feel the cool air as it passes
into your nostrils and fills you up [Music]
allowing each natural out-breath to release any tension that you may be
feeling continue to observe your breath
and allow it to naturally slow down
become aware of your physical experience
with your minds I notice first the palms of your hands notice the energy here
perhaps you feel this as warmth or tingling or maybe a buzzing sensation
notice how simply moving your awareness to this part of your body moves your
energy to this point by simply paying
attention you have the ability to move energy and to move a positive sensation
within you
now begin to widen the experience of your sensations outward from your hands
become aware of the sensations throughout your body
feel the energy moving within you [Music]
be in your body inhabit your body fully
let your attention drift through the sensations in your body without
directing it without judging what you find invite your moving attention on
your body to direct your energy and your thoughts simply allow your focus to tune
into the sensations of your body right here right now
[Music]
when you can do this when you can live in this body when you can sense your own
physical experience you are in the present you are living in the space
between your thoughts when your mind is
attentive to the sensations of your body you can pause you can extend the gap
between your thoughts
this gap is where you can experience peace and calm
notice now if there is anywhere you can soften a little more
look for anywhere you can let go even deeper into relaxation and ease let your
physical body go so that you can let your thoughts go
[Music]
visualize your own body resting and become aware of your own physical
presence allow the weight of your body
to become heavy
allow your awareness to follow the sound of my voice and travel through your body
now on a journey of sensation simply
feel each part as it is mentioned as you
remain still and relax deeper
welcome all sensations you experience just as they are become aware of where
your head meets the support below you
allow your head to feel heavy and supported resting fully allow your face
to relax letting go of any facial expressions to soften anywhere you can
now in your mind you can let your awareness visit the areas in your body
as you hear them moving your awareness
to your face sensing your mouth feel
your mouth feel sensation in your mouth
notice your jaw your lips
and where your upper lip touches your lower lip
since the inside of your mouth your teeth
your gums and your tongue
feel the inside of your cheeks
feel all of your face now as a whole allowing yourself to relax deeper and
deeper and now as I say each part of
your body let your focus move to that part and encourage your release a
complete relaxation to find ease in your
body by simply moving your awareness throughout your body as I mentioned each
part
allow the surface below you to support you fully so there is no need to hold
your position and you can be completely relaxed become aware of your feet now
notice this area and simply relax
move your attention up from your feet and begin to release your lower legs and
knees feel how each part of your body
becomes heavy and goes deeper into relaxation as you allow it to let go and
now find the sense of ease in your thighs and hips as you let go completely
moving up noticing the area of your lower back and abdomen take a deep
breath to move your energy and attention here to release any tightness in your
lower back
continue this process of increasing your comfort by moving your attention and
therefore your energy and as you do
welcome a feeling of softening into your abdomen let your chest and arms rest
heavy on the surface below you moving
your attention upward feel as your neck and throat release any physical and
emotional tension that you may be holding on to notice now the hinges of
your jaw allow your jaw to unclench
relaxing deeper and deeper still
feel as the small muscles of your cheeks eyes and forehead soften and smooth you
may notice that as the small muscles in your face and jaw let go the rest of
your body follows and softens even more still
now your whole body is heavy relaxed and that ease you may sense that
you are safe and supported and you are
open to guiding yourself into a calm state of mind let yourself go
let your mind and body go to a deep and
relaxed State
and now that you are fully relaxed you can turn your attention inward by
checking in with what is true for you since what you are actually feeling give
yourself permission to experience in this present moment without trying to
change anything without allowing
thoughts to take over
let your thoughts come and go
there is no need to attach to them or follow your thoughts
imagine your thoughts are like a river flowing gently downstream let your
thoughts go so you can be here now make
space for the truth to surface in whatever form it comes simply allow it
to surface
make space for awareness and acceptance without judgment
whatever you're feeling is okay these are simply patterns that have developed
they are not you recognize the self-talk
going on in your mind and let your
thoughts come and go
allow yourself to move out of the thinking patterns and bring your
attention to your felt experience
no need to attach words or labels to your feelings simply explore what those
feelings are pause and allow these feelings
give yourself permission to be with this experience let your thoughts come and go
[Music]
if you find your mind drifting going back to old patterns of thinking or
overthinking lovingly come back gesture
your attention to come back to the present moment sensations once more
being present is the way
stay in the moment stay with the feelings and be okay with it
continue to make space in your heart for these feelings to come up and simply be
stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment
longer
as you continue this relaxed inward awareness become aware of any thoughts
arising witness them as if you are
witnessing a flowing river of thoughts see them surface flow by and disappear
each breath cycle Rises and is released
similarly our thoughts rise and are then
released let this idea this knowledge be
a comfort to you to allow your thoughts
to drift down the flowing river of thoughts as you observe them as you let
your thoughts come and go
you may find it helpful to name these thoughts as they arise identify them as
a way to simply be aware of thinking
after they have been named witness them as one drop of water in the flowing
river of thoughts moving with each of the other thoughts rising and falling
and flowing away
let your thoughts come and go [Music]
[Music]
like your breath rising and falling away your thoughts to rise and fall away
no matter how many thoughts come up allow them to flow by if you find
yourself following a thought or reacting to a thought bring your attention back
to the sensations in your body notice
your felt experience
let your thoughts come and go
[Music] if we resist the current of the flowing
river of thoughts it will continue to rush against us pushing in opposition
perhaps giving you the feeling of being stuck
if we accept it allow it we drift
effortlessly along with the current
[Music] the awareness of your thoughts allows
you to let go of the hold they may have on you continue noticing your thoughts
as they arise and allow them to drift away
you may even notice your thoughts coming with more space between them when you practice allowing them to rise
and fall as with the cycle of the breath
if you find you get swept up with a thought with compassion and patience
bring your awareness back to the sensations of your body
now allow yourself to go deeper still
allow all of the thoughts to go
let your scanning awareness drift off simply be present with your truest self
letting all the layers of yourself dissolve let what seemed like boundaries
blur
since a place inside of you that is the place of your inner wisdom your
intuition here inside you is where your
present awareness and insights reside
when you pause and simply be your mind
stops and you open into expansiveness
open into spaciousness [Music]
take a moment now to open yourself up and be receptive to whatever you find
here open to any messages that arise
[Music]
and now you have prepared your mind and your body for a deep peaceful restful
night's sleep [Music]
your subconscious mind is clear your
mind and body are relaxed sleep is
inviting you to let go and surrender to
your dreams
allow this to happen if you wish take the final steps into a deep restful
slumber
as you drift off into dreaming sleep you will continue to experience a peaceful
and calm mind and body
your body knows exactly what to do to relax and allow during your very
productive deep sleep as you drift off
into serene peaceful rest my voice will
gradually disappear and you will be deeply asleep
[Music] when you wake hours later your body and
mind will continue to experience this amazing peaceful and calm state you are
so incredibly relaxed your mind feels
clear and calm and there is an inviting sense of inner
peace flowing throughout your body [Music]
you are ready to rest your mind for the night you are in the perfect place to
get the best night's sleep
you will wake up tomorrow feeling rested and ready to move forward
with a calm and clear mind sweet dreams
