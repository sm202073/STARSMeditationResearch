hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided visualization
it's designed to promote peace of mind for returned soldiers experiencing
post-traumatic stress upon returning home before we move into this visual
journey I would like to acknowledge that this recording is not a replacement for
professional support but rather it is a tool that can help you to explore the
possibility of finding a safe and comfortable place within yourself it is
an anchor into the present moment of
course I encourage anyone listening to this to seek the support that they need from professionals and use this
meditation solely as a peaceful way to help you find peace and release during
those quiet moments before falling asleep so before we begin I invite you
to make sure that you are entirely comfortable in the place that you are now in if there's anything that brings
you extra peace and comfort reach out for these now and this could be as
simple as your pillow a sacred object on your bedside table or anything at all
that brings you more comfort so making sure that you're in a
comfortable lying down position and take a few full settling breaths here as you
ground yourself into this space
at any point during this meditation or at any point throughout the days and
nights to come I invite you to remember that your breath is always available as
an anchor into the present moment each time we draw our awareness to the breath
the past disappears the future disappears and we are reminded of the
stillness that lives in this very moment breath awareness requires nothing but
your attention and can be practiced at any time for just a few seconds or for
many so right now follow my voice for
the next short while as you deepen your awareness of this life force that flows
in and out of your body constantly as
you inhale become more observant of your sensory experience as the air flows into
your nostrils through your windpipe and deep into your lungs
[Music]
and as you exhale witness the release that occurs as the belly softens the
chest falls and your mind just drops away
continue to breathe with this heightened awareness paying close attention to the
pauses in between each breath cycle so
after each inhalation see if you can notice the complete stillness where the
breath is held for just a brief second and after each exhalation observe that
momentary stillness after all the air has been released and just in your own
time repeating this observation on your own for a few more breaths cycles
[Music]
[Music]
know that wherever you have been whatever lingers from days now behind
you you exist nowhere but in this present moment reality allow the breath
and your physical body to remind you of this moving deeply into your physical
presence anytime the mind wanders into stories or images of the past you are
here you are held by your breath your
body and spirit right here
[Music]
while we cannot change what has happened in the past we can continually draw
ourselves more affirmative ly into today by welcoming ourselves exactly as we are
into the reality of this present moment we find space to honor where we've been
while also knowing that we are only ever right here right now this is the only
time we truly have so in just a moment
you will be guided through a safe and soothing visualization to help you tune
into more completely to the present moment take a few more slow and steady
breaths and just after a few cycles let's begin
[Music]
you
[Music]
shifting your attention now away from your breath and into the empty space
behind your closed eyes and this space
holds infinite potential for freedom and release when we adorn it with images of
peace and light and love so upon this
blank canvas I invite you to witness yourself appearing in a place that
provides you with a sense of safety and love for you this might be a particular
outdoor landscape or it might be an indoor space it might be a setting from
your childhood or a place that exists today or it could even be from your
imagination [Music]
there are no rules as to what this space looks like so long as it provides you
with the sense that you are safe supported and held exactly as you are
[Music]
explore this space as you please tuning into any and all of your senses that are
appropriate here what does the imagery
evoke within you
are there any aromas textures or tastes
that bring about a sense of peace and security
[Music] what sounds are present in the space
that surround you if there are no sounds can the silence carry you deeper into
stillness and contentment
[Music]
take a full nourishing inhale and as you
exhale just gently release any tension fear or worry letting it go
[Music]
now I invite you to welcome other beings into this space if it feels comfortable
for you whoever brings you a sense of peace and love is welcome here
perhaps you invite friends to join you family members
[Music] professionals you've worked with or pets
while these beings cannot free you of your past they can support you in your
journey as you move forward if you feel
more at peace in this space alone know that this is entirely okay as well from
moment to moment we require different things sometimes it is the support of
those who love us sometimes it is our personal connection to our highest self
to nature to universe if the latter is
true for you in this moment invite your higher self the natural world or your
understanding of God or the universe into the space within you
even if you have welcomed humans or pets into the visualization already you too
may also invite these deeper connections to support you right now if emotions
arise simply acknowledge them and witness them as passing clouds tuning in
to how they feel within the body rather than the story that they weave in the
mind just trust that this beautiful safe
space you have created as the capacity to hold you exactly as you are and know
that there is no weakness in feeling emotion our emotions are a part of what
makes us human and they are entirely welcome here
[Music]
continually returned to the peaceful imagery around you and to whatever you
have conjured here that brings you peace [Music]
now wherever you have found yourself in this visualization I invite you to take
a seat on the earth or on a couch or any other surface that fits your environment
just getting comfortable you might
conjure up any supportive elements that make you feel at home you might light a
few candles in your mind's eye or surround yourself with any other sacred
objects that settle you
I invite you to visualize a photo album presenting itself on the floor or a
small table before you inscribed in
golden cursive print on the cover the album reads for safe keeping in the soul
this album has presented itself for you so that you may have a safe space to
place any recurring images or dreams about the past whatever you have
witnessed and experienced cannot be taken away from you however the past can
be laid gently to rest tucked away in a safe corner of the soul to inspire the
next stage of your life's purpose
take the album in your hands breathing
deeply as you hold it in quiet reverence
[Music] if any challenging thoughts or images
arise in your consciousness turn these into photographs and tuck them gently
into your album
laying the past down this way in help to honor where you've been while creating
space for lighter imagery and experiences to take root this is not a
denial of where you have been but it may serve as a reminder that these images
are snapshots of the past and now you
have a brighter lighter future to look forward to [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
take a few more silent moments to respectfully tuck away any old
photographs that no longer need to take up space in the forefront of your mind
if the imagery does not arise naturally or if it is too painful for you to
process in this way at this time tune into the natural rhythm of your breath
as you quietly repeat the words right here right now I am safe right here
right now I am safe
you
I invite you to close the photo album now knowing that you can come back to it
at any time you need to store the passed away for safekeeping and remember that
none of this is a denial of the life you have lived it is simply a way of
clearing space for new life to emerge
take a few final moments now to tune back into the beautiful room or
landscape you have visualized using your
breath to ground you here for just a few more moments look around at the support
systems that are available to you friends family members plants and
animals support professionals your highest self the universe anything else
in which you find peace meaning and contentment
come back to your breath remembering that this very simple life force that we
so often take for granted is a pathway back to the present moment back into
peace
gently now allow the scene you have created to begin dissolving as you
reconnect with your awareness of your body in the room and physically support
you allow each muscle to soften melting
further into the surface beneath you
draw the mind down into the heart space thanking yourself for harnessing the
courage and Trust required to move through this journey
now as you gently surrender into sleep allow the following affirmations to fuel
your continued evolution bringing you deeper into peace contentment and
release you may like to mentally repeat
these affirmations as you drift off into sleep I love and honor myself I love and
honor myself [Music]
