hello and welcome to this guided
meditation on letting go and sleep my
name is Jason Stevenson and I will be
taking you through a relaxation before
hopefully you'll be having an immensely
satisfying sleep today my aim is to
assist you in completely letting go and
surrendering before sleep
before we begin set your personal space
up for this wine down to a good night's
sleep put away all distracting items and
power down all your devices apart from
the one on which you are playing this
recording you may wish to take a moment
to jot down any pending tasks which can
wait until tomorrow it's vital to
incorporate rest into your busy schedule
and with a good night's sleep you
recharge your batteries and rejuvenate
your spirit for a great day ahead so
without further adieu lie back into a
comfortable position allowing your body
to adjust your mattress
feel your spine settling back and
relaxing
rest your head back against a pillow if
that is your preference and just savor
the relief of simply lying back after an
active day
if you haven't already done so let your
eyes close naturally just allow the
eyelids to gently come together no need
to squeeze them shut and forget for the
moment about trying to sleep
just inhale deeply thinking to yourself
breathe in
hold your breath a little and then
breathe out being conscious of your
breath
as our breathing comes under control so
too does our mind it's not about trying
too hard to control your breathing
instead it's letting it occur naturally
and just being aware of it
you
on your next breath in focus on the
center of your forward
hold your breath permitting it to gently
soothe your forehead like a bomb
and relax let go
on your next breath in feel your eyelids
become soft and relaxed
and as you exhale notice how your
eyelids get heavier and heavier as they
welcome sleep
on your next breath in breathing in and
feel cool energy to your cheeks and hold
your breath
exhaling feel your cheeks lower
comfortably like they just drop deeper
and deeper relaxed
on your next breath in focusing on your
jaw muscles
feel your teeth come apart and your
lower jaw drop slightly
if the tip of your tongue is stuck to
the roof of your mouth let it fall and
relax
next bring your attention to your neck
muscles
and on your breath in
energy of that breath to need away at
your neck taking the strain away
senior Nick further
on your next breath in bringing a dose
of relief to your back
the energy run along your spine
unwinding all the knots in your upper
and lower back
and on your next breath out allow any
tension or aches to be carried away with
this strand of exhalation
feel your body relaxing deeper and
deeper now
breathe in again and bring your
attention to
chest pulling apart all the knots that
wind your chest up tired
and breathe out and savor this
liberating relief of deep and satisfying
relaxation
breathing in again and this time feeling
your shoulders let go they drop a little
and the muscles in your arms your biceps
and triceps and into the forearms feel
any stress in this area melt away
right down to the tips of your fingers
you
breathing in again and sending the
breath right down to your abdomen and
feel it expand
and contract as you breathe out
just letting it sink back in naturally
and sending you into a deeper state of
relaxation
introduce some of that relaxing energy
to your legs as you take the next breath
in
upon breathing out let any remaining
pressure escape through the tips of your
toes and your outward breath
you
through the breath you bring balance to
your system with each conscious breath
you become more and more aware of the
present moment
very moment you simply are you are
perfect you are whole just take a moment
now to observe the natural flow of your
breathing
you
notice how with each breath in your
chest
izes and with each breath out it falls
up and down
just like the steadily swinging pendulum
of life
you
bring your attention to this precise
moment
to struggle or to force yourself to do
this by simply coming back to your
breath you will return to the moment and
become aware of it just breathe in and
then breathe out
from the start of a new day right up to
the end we are exposed to thousands of
thoughts don't try to fight your
thoughts simply observe them witness
them and then coming back to your breath
slowly let those thoughts go
remember breathe in and breathe out
you may find yourself thinking about a
particular event or events that have
passed
slowing down the thought process
drift among those memories witness them
from above and recognize them
tell yourself I'm thinking about this
event I acknowledge it
and as you breathe out move along with
the breath detaching yourself a little
more from that particular thought
we must understand that we cannot change
the past that we can learn something
from it
upon a lesson you might have learned
from that event or those events
again to not strain yourself to think of
the lesson simply breathe in and breathe
out again
and if something comes to mind take it
with you if not remain with the breath
and you can always return for further
reflection at another time
breathe in
and as you breathe out let the past flow
through your system and out to become
one with the universe
sometimes we are overpowered by a sense
of anger or grief and that in turn holds
us back if this is the case view now if
any of these thoughts arise just breathe
in
focusing on that breathing breathing
afresh energy and on your breath out
becoming fully aware of your breath
in this state of relaxation your mind is
operating at a slower more passive
frequency
you are hence able to observe these
feelings of anger or grief without
letting it affect you
a moment now to reflect upon this did
not try too hard to determine the source
of it simply acknowledge its presence
and then return to the breath
there are opportunities to become angry
and upset every now and again however
it's important to remember that we have
a choice of whether or not to feed these
emotions and by merely coming back to
the breath you can bring yourself back
into alignment you can choose not to let
these things bother you they are not
worth your precious time
if you have any anger or resentment as
you inhale and exhale let them go
reminding yourself that is not worth
giving into you want more you are strong
our belief systems can sometimes place
restrictions on us
however we can all make the choice to
follow what we truly believe in
make yourself aware of this choice
through the bread
inhale bring into your system that
things that are most important to you
bring to mind what you most value in
your life
and as you breathe out let go of those
feelings that do not resonate with you
and that hold you back from being the
best version of your truest self but
those beliefs go knowing they do not
serve the true you in any way
it may not be our beliefs but a
troubling thought may linger after hours
of the event
in this census like a game of tennis
there are times when you may lose a
point but there are other times where
you'll gain one the only thing to
remember is to keep playing and to keep
playing it's simply a matter of
breathing therefore just breathe in
and breathe out again
there is no saying what the future holds
for us to dwell on the uncertainty only
brings more stress more anxiety
through gratitude and appreciation of
all the gifts life has offered you today
be certain that tomorrow will be better
reassert this on your next breath bring
in all the wonders of your present life
everything that you are grateful for
only think of one or two things and they
can be as simple as having a roof over
your head or having your next meal
all this breath just for a moment
as you breathe out release all
expectations of tomorrow let go of all
control
surrender and that weight of expectation
will be automatically lifted
here and now you are wholly present
neither your past your future your
troubles nor your beliefs can take this
moment away from you
this is the gift known as the present
one that comes for all of us to embrace
stay here for a moment
in and out
existing completely in this present
moment
let go of everything that is beyond your
control
you've done your part to the best of
your abilities the rest now will be
taken care of
trust in life now
you deserve the best and with the
following affirmations you may surrender
completely you can mentally repeat these
to yourself
I accept all the gifts that the universe
has to offer me
I am grateful for
mirakl I find around every corner
I appreciate my life by living it to the
fullest
I love the way I am and believe in my
abilities
I am totally free
I choose to do things that make me happy
I fully deserve to be happy
I am loved and loved fully
I am the best version of my truest self
I am fully present in this moment
I welcome wealth and abundance into my
life
I now surrender that which is beyond my
control
to the universe
this is your final passageway to a rich
and abundant sleep
you've come a long way in accepting your
present and letting go of that which has
held you back
you've worked hard and the sleep that
beckons is fully deserved
hold more miracles and blessings than
what yesterday did expect the unexpected
and surrender any pre-existing notions
about the future just let them go
focus now entirely on the breath
and let it carry you on to your slumber
follow your own natural rhythm breathing
in and out
and in your mind's eye visualize a trap
door that opens up
ten steps covered in thick crimson
carpet that easily muffles your
footsteps leads downwards to a
pleasantly lit place of peace
I will count you down from ten guiding
each step that you take
10 take the first step
holding onto the golden rail
you are reminded of the soothing balm of
your breathing
