you
[Music]
hello I'm Jason Stephenson and welcome to this healing meditation designed to
enhance your experience of physical and emotional well-being as you prepare for
a deeply restorative sleep during this guided meditation you will bring
compassion and healing attention to different parts of the body and mind before finding your way into a deep
slumber I invite you now to open your heart to the transformative capacity of
this meditation and to that of your own inner being [Music]
before we begin take a moment to ensure that everything in the outside world is
turned off or put away for the day the lights and any alerts on your phone or
other devices are turned off and preferably the blinds are drawn ensuring
that all end of day tasks are taken care of will help you to immerse yourself in
this meditation and into deeply healing sleep once all of the outside
requirements are taken care of take some time to ensure that you're in a comfortable lying down position ensure
that the body is relaxed and well supported as you come to find stillness
wherever you are [Music] gently closing your eyes and take a
moment now to see if you can feel into the physical space that supports you
notice the way your body is held in the safety and solidity of the physical
world know that it is safe for you to let go to allow any held tension to melt
away in this very moment
[Music]
[Music]
whatever presents itself during this or during any meditation is entirely welcomed it is safe for you to be fully
present within your experience allow your own inner strength my voice and the
deep silence to guide you through this meditation you are well taken care of
within your own presence begin to
witness the way that breath flows through you come to see how effortlessly
it fills your physical body and then how naturally it glides back into the outer
environment for a few moments now draw
your attention to your breath allowing it to ground you in this present moment
[Music]
[Music] the outside world gently falls away as
you are guided continuously via the breath back into this very moment in
time now without attempting to change your
breath in any way I invite you to draw your attention to the belly simply
observe the way it rises and the way it falls and notice what happens to the
breath as you draw your attention to the stomach what happens to the body is
there a softening or possibly a sense of release is the ease or unease whatever
may be the case for you simply acknowledge what is present within the body as you shift your attention from
breath to belly [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
getting to know the body in this way facilitates your ability to heal itself
this type of getting to know the body is not intellectual in any way it's
experiential through this meditation you're invited to become more intimate
with the physical body witnessing it exactly as it rests here right in this
very moment by practicing this deep
presence we shift from thinking into feeling and into being by allowing the
body to be exactly as it is and by bringing our awareness to it we begin to
soften the mental preconceptions maintaining their firm grip on our beliefs about the body gently allow any
firmly held concepts to melt away allowing a deeper experience of full
openness and presence to take its place [Music]
come back to the breath for a few moments allowing it to continually carry
you into each unfolding moment breath by
breath moment by moment
[Music]
I invite you now to expand the scope of your breath on your next inhalation
gently guide or envision the breath spanning all the way down to your toes
and on the next exhalation guide the
breath to the top of your head nourishing each part as it passes
continue to envision the breath looping gently through your body this way
softening every area of stress or tension that it touches take a few
moments of silence here allowing the breath to soothe every cell of your body
[Music]
as you come to be more in touch with the body on a deeper level take a moment to
consider that you are made up of trillions of cells each of these cells
intermingles with the others in order to keep you alive and well as you rest in
meditation the body welcomes this space and time provided to heal itself on a
deep level sale a level know that right
now the body is taking care of itself to bring you into a greater sense of
vitality and wellness so take a moment
now to gently scan the body noticing any spiraling sensations of energy moving
through you as you come to feel the body on an energetic level see if you begin
to consciously touch the cellular level of the body take a few moments of
silence here to dive into the subtle realms of the body to those parts that
go invisible to the eye [Music]
draw your awareness naturally to various areas of the body allowing yourself to
be guided by your inner compass simply notice what you notice simply allow
yourself to feel what you feel your own inner wisdom will guide you let any
notions about what this experience should be like just to fall away and as
you move deeply into yourself take time to notice any areas of tension pain or
discomfort [Music]
now this pain or discomfort may be primarily physical it may be emotional
or energetic simply notice what areas of your being are calling to you for
healing take a moment to focus on one area of the body or mind that is
speaking to you through discomfort or tension as you bring your attention to
this area allow your breath to follow this awareness just gently and naturally
allow your breath and your inner capacity for compassion to touch this place
[Music]
without trying to change anything about this experience allow the discomfort to
be bathed by the warmth of your breath and by your loving presence so take a
few moments of silence here as you allow your body to heal on a cellular level
[Music]
you [Music]
now gently loosen your attention coming back to the rhythm of your natural
breath remember that your breath is your anchor and if at any point your mind
wanders your breath is always available to redirect you to your present
experience so come now to a different
area of the body or mind to a second aspect of you in need of a little extra
support care or tenderness invite this
place into your awareness as you cleanse it with your inner infinite well of love
and kindness
hold it compassionately in your field of awareness allowing the breath to soothe
it and as you breathe let any tension or pain that is held there to slowly soften
[Music] continue to breathe consciously as we
enter a few moments of silence during which you may dedicate your love and attention to this second area of your
being [Music]
[Music]
gently softening your inner gaze come back to the steady flow of your breath
allow yourself to feel into a deeper stillness and sense of relaxation that
is present to you right now know that your body is being healed
energetically physically and emotionally as you rest here in stillness so come
now to one more area of the body physical emotional or otherwise
energetic that is calling for your attention do not seek for anything to
come to you simply allow it to enter into your awareness if you are now
feeling deeply healed and relaxed and no specific aspect of your being is
appearing hold your entire body in the field of your awareness now breathe into
the area that has come to you or into your entire body with a warm and loving
presence allow yourselves to transform
as we speak perhaps feeling their energetic presence within the body and mind bathe in this
loving attention allowing the breath to nourish and to heal
[Music]
[Music]
I invite you now to soften your attention once more gently releasing
whatever it is holding as you return to your breath this time notice a profound
sense of peace and relaxation coming over your entire being on a cellular
level you are being transformed this healing radiates out to all different
aspects of you holding you in a divine sense of peace wholeness and vitality
[Music] breathe deeply now releasing any
remaining tension on each exhale [Music]
continue to draw your attention to the breath as you sink deeper and deeper
into your innate wholeness [Music]
as we prepare for sleep who will come to release all areas of the body gently and
naturally allow my voice to guide you towards each body part and as I name
each part simply hold this piece of you in your awareness and then allow it to
let go of any remaining tension stress or other sensation allow each part of
you to sink into a deeper relaxation so
let's begin with the toes holding them in your awareness
[Music] and gently releasing them moving your
awareness now to your feet the whole of
your feet and letting go releasing in
the same way [Music]
moving up to your ankles let go
[Music] and you're both lower legs getting a
sense of the space that these take up
release your knees underneath your knees

moving up to your upper arms and your
shoulders taking note of your shoulders we can store a lot of tension here just
being aware of your shoulders and gently

[Music]
envision your whole body now entirely relaxed and healed emotionally
physically and energetically sensor
lightness to your being radiating out from each cell of your body in this
moment you are free relaxed and full of
health and vitality so coming back now
to your breath allowing each inhalation and each exhalation to continually
nourish and support you [Music]
as you rest in this space you begin to sense the lightness of your body and
mind moving closer towards sleep allow
yourself now to drift into the dream world and naturally know that the
cellular healing will continue while you sleep your body's wisdom will continue
to restore your being with each breath [Music]
as you rest here peacefully come to notice a wider light pulsating from the
heart space within its glow it carries
love lightness and the capacity for deep healing become aware of it expanding
slowly nurturing each part of the body that it touches this white light
consumes everything in its way leaving no part of the body or mind untouched
it holds the capacity to transform your being and to bring you health vitality
and radiance
over time this white light comes to touch every part of the body from the
edge of your toes to the top of your head it goes so far as to expand to fill
the room outside the perceived boundaries of your being everything in
your mind's eye now rests in this healing white light nothing is too dark
or too heavy to be illuminated the white
glow softens your body and mind carrying you naturally into a deeply restorative
slumber although the spoken part of this
meditation is coming to a close continue to breathe in this energy until
you fall asleep even as you drift into
the dream world you will continue to be bathed in the healing glow of this white
light continuing to heal continuing to
release [Music]
