hello my name is jason stevenson
and welcome to this short guided
meditation
that will facilitate your release of any
negative
or limiting thoughts that no longer
serve you
it's time to let go of whatever has been
holding you back
to begin this transformative practice
bring yourself to a comfortable
seated position either on the floor on a
bench or in a chair
and wherever you find yourself
straightening your spine
and let your heart space open up ever so
gently and allow your shoulders to drop
closing your eyes when you're ready
[Music]
let's take a few moments now to settle
in by drawing our attention to the
breath
[Music]
and simply observe any sensations
associated with each
inward and each outward
movement
[Music]
you might notice the temperature of the
air as it enters your nostrils
the feeling of the belly expanding and
softening
or a general sense of relaxation moving
through your body
[Music]
and now with each breath that enters
your lungs
i invite you to envision revitalized
energy mingling with your cellular body
and with each breath that departs
imagine any unsupportive energy
being released
so breathing in fresh energy full of
renewed
vitality
and breathe out whatever is calling to
be
surrendered
now i invite you to enter into a visual
journey
of transformation by imagining that you
are standing
at the foot of a wooded mountain
beneath you your feet root into the rich
soil
footpath
and all around evergreen trees stretch
up towards the cosmos
[Music]
your nose picks up the scent of the pine
infused aroma of these woods
cleansing you from within with each
full breath you take
[Music]
and before you the footpath weaves its
way through the forest
up towards the mountain's peak
eager to begin this journey of
transformation and release
you take your first few steps
in the direction of the summit above
[Music]
as you walk you feel life's vital energy
flowing through you your body is engaged
your mind is focused and your breath
begins to deepen
along your journey through the forest
that blankets the slope of the mountain
you admire the qualities you observe in
this natural landscape
the resilience the strength
the adaptability and the beauty
of the wildlife that is abundant here
as you admire these qualities in the
world outside of you
you begin to realize that they reflect
what is innately
present within you too
as you continue to hike towards the peak
you feel this truth permeating more
deeply
with hours passing that feel as though
they were sheer
minutes the land beneath you begins to
level out
as the earth plateaus you make your way
through the final
stretch of trees before emerging onto
the flat rock
of this majestic mountain's peak
you breathe in and release a deep sigh
your jaw drops and your heart
widens to the beauty of the world that
extends around you
valleys rivers lakes and forests
down below reach out in all directions
you are witnessing the world from this
heightened perspective
as if for the very first time
and as the gentle breeze rushes against
your skin
you remember your intention for coming
here
to release what no longer serves you and
to welcome the winds of change that will
propel you forward
and so here standing upon the
mountaintop
you let come to mind any
and all of the negative thoughts that no
longer serve you
when they arise they do not stay with
you for long as you surrender them
up to the wind that dances through the
atmosphere
all around you
surrender with the breath exhalation
by exhalation each
thought each feeling
and every negative knot of energy that
holds you back
from realizing your true potential
let the wind carry them away from you
leaving you vibrantly alive
[Music]
allow the muscles around your eyes to
relax now
and your attention to land in the center
of your heart
and as you gaze out upon the wonder of
the world above
below and all around you
silently set an intention to nourish
yourself
with positive thoughts in the minutes
hours and days to come
take one more long deep breath in here
and when you release let go of any
residual
negative energy with a deep sigh
let it out
[Music]
slowly now let the imagery of this
landscape
begin to fade from your mind's eye as
you come back
to the natural rhythm of your breathing
tune into your body into the earth
supporting you from below
and when you are ready you can gently
let the light
seep back into your eyes as they slowly
open
[Music]
and as you move through the day ahead
let yourself be empowered by the
transformation and release
that you've experienced in this practice
today
allow the winds of inspired change
continue to awaken and guide you
many blessings
you
