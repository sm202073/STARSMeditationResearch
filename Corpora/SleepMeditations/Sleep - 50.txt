[Music]
[Laughter]
below and welcome my friends my name is Jason Stevenson and thank you for
joining me on this sleep meditation golden stars astral heights meditation
this meditation is unlike any other meditation I have previously done as
this meditation is being guided with the help of my guided spiritual adviser
David [Music] so I asked you to find a comfortable
position lying down preferably with your
back straight wriggling around finding yourself
finding that space where you can lay comfortably and breathe with ease
begin the meditation by taking in three deep breaths in through the nose sending
that breath all the way down to the lower belly area and releasing letting
go just do this a few more times
and when you are done returning your breathing back to a comfortable rhythm
that is natural for you I need to try to change it just be with your breath enjoy
the sensation of that breath as it passes through your nostrils sending it
down and feeling it as it releases through your nostrils once more
if at any time during this meditation your thoughts wander away from my voice
you simply just have to acknowledge that thought and your job is simply to bring
your focus back to your breathing in and out this meditation does not have to be
complex in any way our job is simply to
allow our mind to fall away to give it rest for the day whilst we allow our
heart and spirit to open and surrender
[Music] so for these next few moments simply
being with your breath you may feel your
stomach rising and falling maybe the sides of
your belly rising and falling or your lower back area expanding on the breath
in contracting on the breath out
[Music] really connect with your breathing just
be here and enjoy this process and I will return in a few moments time
[Music]
I would like you now to visualize a golden light that is pouring in from the
top of your head and it's beginning to fill you and pour all the way down your
entire body it's a shining golden light and as it
pours in it soothes you calms your mind
and relaxes you
feel it as it travels down your face
relaxing your facial muscles your eyebrows your forward nose and cheeks
and your eyes and eye sockets just allowing them to feel heavy and relaxed
down into your throat and your shoulders
and now filling your arms down to your elbows your forearms wrists and right
down to your hands and fingertips
you may even feel a tingling sensation within your fingers and if you do just
allow that to be you don't have to judge that or try to name that just accept
that as it is
and coming back up your harms
your shoulders and down now that the golden light continues to spill down to
your chest area your stomach and your
shoulder blades and your spine running down your spinal cord releasing all
tension and allowing you to relax deeply
[Music] the golden light is continuing to pour
in and runs down now to your pelvis area
your groin your buttocks just allowing
it to soften and relax no tension
and your thighs the tops of your thighs the backs of your thighs your knees
behind your knees and down your calf
muscles your shins and pouring down into
your feet soles of your feet the bridge of your feet right down into the very
tips of each toe filling them up one by
one
and this light begins to fill your entire body now it's moving up and back
up your feet your shins your calf muscles billing your body soothing your
body relaxing your body getting ready for the most wonderful journey you're
about to embark on moving up now to your
knees the backs of your knees your thighs your pelvis your groin buttocks
up to your stomach area your lower back
feeling at all let go if there are any knots within your stomach feeling them
loosen and untie moving up to your chest
and your shoulders and seeing from your
fingertips your wrists elbows upper arms
filled with this golden light moving up
to your throat and your face your neck
and right along your back your back softening lengthening
and right up to the tip of your head beginning to overflow now this golden
light [Music]
keep breathing keep breathing
vo this overflow now begin to pour
outside of your body encompassing your entire body
nikka of gold and sparkling light
refracting all shades of gold
and sparkles of gold beginning to drip down onto your bed showering down
[Music] helping you to release everything from
your mind to empty your mind to unlearn
what you've learned today to forgive any
grudges or resentments of health today to release them because just right now
they don't serve you and we're here to
serve you
but like you now to visualize there's gold and light beginning to pulse
through your body from the top of your head in waves right down to the tips of
your toes feel it vibrating pulsing
through
and this golden light pulsing now delivering an energy a healing energy a
positive energy there's going to be with you for this meditation to heal you on
many forms emotionally mentally
physically giving you what you need for these next few moments
[Music]
[Music] this vibration now begins to quicken and
as it gets faster begins to pause through your body at a faster rate you
begin to feel lighter and lighter almost
like you are lifting off your bed beginning to rise above your bed
and you are so be it you are you
continue to rise above your bed and even if you look back for a moment you can
see that you are there your body is there lying down now over you your
eternal spirit it's beginning to rise further and further up and away from
your body you are safe in this zone
because you are simply loved you begin
now to pass through the roof of where you once were passing through with ease
with grace
you keep moving up and up further
enjoying the floating feeling of being free from all worries concerns and
restrictions of the physical body your
mind is free
you're moving up into an amazing astral plane where you can look back and begin
to see not only your house but the community that you live in the lights
below twinkling looking oh so peaceful
and you continue to rise rising above
looking back down seeing cities seeing countryside's seeing your entire country
and the waters surrounding your country
moving out into another expanse reaching another plane a plane of space a plane
of nothingness and yet everything loading drifting
you are like a golden ball of vibrating energy showering from you sparks of love
harmony and peace falling away going
back to the earth as you continue to rise
moving up now you begin to see the curvature of the world of the earth how
beautiful it looks from here and from
here realizing that your troubles and concerns that you may have had seemed oh
so trivial now almost non-existent
you simply continue to float to drift
into this ever expansive consciousness a
space that is set aside for you
a space where you are connected to all that is and all that ever was
[Music]
[Music]
here you have time to reflect on what really is important in your life and an
answer that keeps calling to you over and over again is love love for who you
are love your family love your friends
and love and the God sauce that is within you and without guiding you
protecting you and keeping you safe
what you are now is true human spirit and a mass of potential
you are vibrating at a light frequency it continued to rise more moving up and
away from the galaxy that which you existed and into higher realms of space
pure ecstasy and bliss
your soul is a pure vibration stage [Music]
vibrating love healing and eternal consciousness
when you consider any worries that you may have had that you have been carrying
around with you you allow them now to completely fall away from you
in this etheric body you're now in any thoughts of worries or concerns simply
not important and not relevant on this plane
if you've had any health issues right where you are now in this existence you
are pure 100% health white light your
cells are healing rebuilding themselves
regrouping and buzzing with positive energy and light your cells are
reconnecting not only with yourself but
with everything else around you there is no separation as you continue to float
to blend to be at one and to rejoice in
this
just allow yourself to float in this space allow yourself to simply be
you are pure energy
pure vibration
if you have any fears or concerns these aren't important for you at this time if
you feel the need to come back to them later you may but for now bask in what
you are in this giant expanse of amazing
energy and connection and you continue to float up even further now
and as you begin to get higher you realize there's an opening and in that
opening it's pure white light shining through and this opening this white
light opening is calling you and there is no fear connected to this only a
sense of belonging of love gratitude and harmony connection to all that is so you
begin to float higher and higher and

continuing to make you feel safe and secure as you continue to move downwards
drifting back down just down below you is the hole into
which you're going to float through to return to the galaxy the dark galaxy
with the zillions of stars surrounding you moving down into that hole and into
that new opening of expanse stars
glistening stars calling out to you
beckoning you to float with them for a while to enjoy their company

hear voices see colors just be open and aware to

that they may have given you if you
didn't hear anything that is perfectly fine for this time you may like to come
back some other time and revisit this space moving back now drifting down

glistening lights of the city's
expansive spaces of darkness where the ocean lies so much beauty there
