hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this positive sleep bubble
and healing meditation this guided meditation is designed to help you go to
sleep with a positive mindset and have a sound sleep so let us begin by getting
comfortable closing your eyes resting your hands just lightly by your side and
taking in three deep breaths in through the nose and exhaling through your mouth
blowing all the excess air out and feeling the expansion and contraction of
your stomach muscles as the air comes in and then leaves your body
and bringing your attention now back to your regular breathing nothing forced or
strained just find your regular pattern and be a witness to your regular
breathing just observe it
[Music]
during this meditation you may find that your mind may wander and that's simply
okay that's a practice of meditation it happens we are thinking beings and all
you need to do is not to try to push the thoughts away but rather just bring your
focus back to either my voice or to your breathing that helps you get back into
the present moment so keep breathing
naturally and let go of everything that has happened today and let go of everything that is going
to happen or that you think is going to happen tomorrow this is your time now
right here right now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
take a moment to tune into your body and to check how you feel if there are any
areas of tension left just visualize the words let go and relax and feel your
body responding to that
[Music]
you feel free from any anxieties feel
your body getting heavier you are
relaxed it feels perfect
so relaxed in fact that your body is beginning to sink down down right down
all the way down into the mattress as
you get heavier if you have any tension feeling that draining away let
everything go
and as you do this feel a deep sense of peace well up inside you
[Music]
throughout this meditation you'll feel the sensation of relaxation and
sleepiness just welcome these feelings do not try to fight them just embrace
the warm vibe throughout but listen to the sound of my voice as I guide you
deeper into this meditation which will ensure powerful feelings of positivity
flooding through your body in healing waves and the more you embrace and open
up to the sensation of relaxation the more powerful the results will be for
you so I would like you to repeat
inwardly after me I am ready for peace
I am ready to let go of any internal stresses I am ready to switch off from
any external stresses or distractions I
am ready for complete freedom from my day
I leave behind any negative thoughts or feelings
I welcome positive sleep mentally repeat
these words again and the more you do this the more your body will respond you
don't have to say them out loud just visualize yourself repeating and emphasizing the words I am ready for
peace
I am ready to let go of any internal stresses
I am ready to switch off from any external stresses or distractions
I am ready for complete freedom from my day
I leave behind any negative thoughts or feelings
I welcome a positive healing sleep now

glorious day the Sun is still a golden ball sinking
lower in the sky and you are standing on a wooden walkway
leading out towards the gentle lapping waves of the ocean

right for you

dissipate any self-doubt or concerns

the sea or sit with your feet dangling over the edge and feel the waves
splashing over your toes breathe in this
pure salty air and let go of expectations stress concerns or any
inner angst you may add they have no place here this is your time
look up into the sky and notice the glorious transformation of colors
at first pay attention to the golden and Orange rays from the Sun that shine out
across the darkening sky
now notice the blue skies as they darken with red and orange colors dabbed as if
with artistic fingers transforming the skies and the colors around you you feel
bathed in an orange glow she relaxed in this wonderful setting you notice tiny
bubbles of thought and energy floating all around you like the scenery they are
tinged with golden hues and they represent the various stages of healing
and sleep transformation spend a little
time focusing on these bubbles as one small bubble floats towards you
visualize yourself holding out one hand and the gentle touch as it settles on
your palm
your bubble has an inner message relax
let it all go as you read it inhale and
then exhale fully but every muscle within relax the words are moving within
the bubbles and as it expands and then pops right before you reach out and
gently take the next bubble from the air

a moment to embrace these words you are perfect you are kind and you deserve
inner peace

of the ocean and the sky is now slightly distorted as the bubble moves and
sparkles with the purest of energy

towards the beach ensuring your sense of calm remains there are many flickering
lights positioned just off this boardwalk as you step on the sand feel
the sensation of the sand between your toes and hear the relaxing sound of the
ocean as it gently laps against the shore you see hundreds of candles
burning brightly they are placed in an arc shape and at varying heights inside
the arc is a beautiful and comfortable seat that enables you to lie back
as you take your place and make yourself comfortable it melds to your body
supporting you so that you feel as if you are lying on the fluffiest of clouds
you feel so at home you feel so in tune
with nature the candles all around you
light up the darkness and the sight of candle flames burning and flickering gently all around you is mesmerizing

paleness across the night sky and the rhythmic waters nearby lull you into an
