ease into deep sleep quickly with the soothing guided meditation unwind after
a long busy day disconnect from worry and let your mental activity naturally
begin to slow and practice acceptance to let go of resistance while you sleep
when you expect your reality to be something other than what it actually is you add unnecessary suffering to your
experience when you can release your resistance and accept what is you can
experience peace what you're thinking about right before you fall asleep will
set the tone for not only the quality of your sleep but also your mindset for the
next day you have the choice to change the way you look at things hello and
welcome I'm massara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are an oasis
where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self-healing let's settle in
for this evening meditation and relaxation practice I invite you to make
yourself comfortable create a safe and
tranquil environment for yourself making sure you are all set to drift off into
sleep if you wish it is important for you to have the
sense of safety so you can fully relax
make sure your room is dark and if possible turn off all screens and
electronics if you are listening to this on an electronic device perhaps turn the
screens light away from you create the most comfortable environment that you
can feel free to pause this recording as you get yourself set up if you need
[Music] as you are settling in lie down under
your covers stretch your legs and take
three deep breaths
[Music]
if your mind is wandering it's no big deal that is typical as the momentum of
the day gradually slows simply become
aware of your thoughts just as they are with acceptance
notice these thoughts arising and passing by notice with curiosity and
permission rather than the need for change the mind will not stop thinking
completely so you can choose to notice accept and
allow these thoughts to pass by [Music]
as you acknowledge and allow your thoughts to pass you can begin to slip
deeply into relaxation
[Music]
become aware of your breath just as it is
notice with curiosity all there is to notice about your natural graph without
the need to have it be something that it is not already
[Music] since your breath without the need to
change it in any way [Music]
our breath is always there for us in the background an automatic action
let the inhale and exhale guide you into
a calm deeply relaxed State
become aware of your inner physical experience just as it is notice how you
are showing up to this practice not needing to be something else
[Music] not needing to be somewhere different
than exactly where you are
take note of exactly where you are on your journey with acceptance
[Music] you can give yourself permission to
simply be
peace is available when we stop resisting any given moment
notice your body sensations just as they are
notice any body pain with acceptance
notice anybody pleasure with acceptance
notice any neutral areas with acceptance
settle into your body except being in
your body right now just as you are
take this time to be with yourself move
closer to yourself accepting all that
you are
there is no need to make a change during meditation be just as you are accepting
allows us to fully experience what is happening in the present moment to fully
engage in life [Music]
know that without suffering we cannot know joy without darkness we cannot know
light allowing life as it is can lessen
any struggle and perhaps additional unnecessary suffering when you feel life
brings you challenges you can't accept you have the opportunity to be
transformed by acceptance
you may add suffering when you resist the way things are because they aren't
the way you expect or want them to be
you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the
way things are naturally there is a
possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true
[Music]
peace is available when you stop resisting any given moment
become aware of your whole body in your environment
[Music] notice where your body makes contact
with the surface beneath you and feel yourself being grounded
since the weight of your body making a strong anchoring connection
[Music]
let go into gravity to feel heavy into your support notice the fabric of your
clothes on your skin or the areas of exposed skin feeling the
touch of the air simply be aware of your
experience in this moment [Music]
scan your body for any areas of tension
except your experience as it is and then
use your attention to welcome a softening
a sense of ease to move throughout your body [Music]
as you observe your body soften and release any areas you are able
invite in the feeling of peace as you begin to tune out the whole world around
you and go within with my voice as a
soothing guide to help you sleep in a
moment I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the top
of your head going all the way through your body down to your feet as I say
each part of your body you can see that part in your mind's eye notice what is
true with acceptance so that you can invite relaxation to that body part
welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind encourage the
weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface below you so
that there is no need to hold on you can simply let go into sleep
now as you begin to scan your body bring
your attention to the top of your head
begin to notice the sensations here [Music]
and then relax the top of your head and your scalp
[Music] welcome this ease into your forehead and
eyes relax any facial expression release
the tiny muscles around your eyes and
feel your eyelids becoming heavy allow
your cheeks to soften
unclench your jaw and allow your teeth
to part
become aware of the area of your neck and throat and with acceptance of your
present moment experience completely
relaxed
as you accept yourself just as you are
you allow each muscle to relax in progression and this invites a deeper
sense of relaxation to the parts of your
body that came before it in your body scan
continue to notice except
and relax as you invite a sense of peace
and stillness to your shoulders chest
and arms
perhaps feeling a comfortable heaviness move into your ribs abdomen and back
[Music]
let go of any gripping in your hips and
allow your thighs to rest heavy on the surface below you as if there is no
difference between where you end and where the surface begins
you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part
allows it to relax and let go
since now your ankles and feet
releasing and relaxing completely
take another moment to slowly scan your body once more
[Music] this time notice any areas that may
still be holding on to any lingering tension and after acknowledging and
accepting your present experience ask
your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in
control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe
and supported and knows what to do to relax if you
simply allow the tension to release
[Music]
in addition to the added suffering that occurs when you resist the way things
are you may also experience suffering when you are not accepting of yourself
self-acceptance means accepting yourself exactly as you are without any wishes of
how you should be there is a possibility
for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true
the practice of self-acceptance is a step toward freedom and happiness in
your life
self-acceptance is knowing deep down in your heart that you are enough as you
are it means being comfortable with your
body your emotions and your mind
it means accepting what you have achieved as well as what you have not
yet accomplished
acceptance of all your strengths as well as what you may consider your flaws
it means being exactly who you are and not who you want others to see you as
accepting yourself is not about praising yourself or receiving praise from others
it means that you have a sense from within that you feel loved simply
because you are being yourself [Music]
when you love and accept yourself you are authentic and can trust yourself
the first step on the path of self-acceptance is increased awareness
as you build this awareness of yourself invite any feelings you may be having to
show up fully
welcome both positive and negative and
honor what they are without judging or
trying to change accept any positive
emotions and know that you deserve to feel good
[Music] and when negative emotions come to the
surface treat yourself as you would a loved one with kindness and compassion
[Music]
know that these emotions are just that emotions
they are not you they do not make you the person that you are
[Music] notice your emotions as they show up for
you now [Music]
since the physical feelings of your emotions and where in your body you may
be experiencing them
notice with curiosity and acceptance
experience your emotions just as they are let go of what you may think your
thoughts or your emotions should be
without changing anything simply meet yourself exactly where you are in the
present moment and be aware of yourself
the second step towards self-acceptance is loving-kindness and compassion for
yourself in order to fully love and
accept yourself you must let go of limiting beliefs and self-defeating
behaviors let go of anything that no
longer serves you on your journey to self-acceptance
take a moment to let go of all the behaviors and beliefs that no longer
serve you or are working against you
[Music] there is no need to name these
specifically right now simply let the negative energy go and replace it with
positive energy
make space for acceptance [Music]
let go of judgments of ourselves and comparisons to others
let go of unmet and unrealistic expectations
let go of the need for perfection to be
human is to be imperfect
let go of comparisons with past versions of yourself
let go of negative self-talk
let go of shame and let go of guilt
let it all go see all of this melting
off of your body to be gone from your life forever without going into story or
naming specific events let go of blame
of ourselves and others let the heavy
feeling float off your shoulders
let go of blame of our circumstances
let the sensation dissolve from your muscles
[Music] let go of judgment of good and bad
when we practice meditation we can choose to befriend our circumstances
with compassion
in a moment I will guide your subconscious with some positive
affirmation statements of acceptance of reality as well as acceptance of self
[Music] there is no need to repeat these if you
are so relaxed you are almost sleeping
your subconscious will hear them simply
believe they are true continue to relax
fully and know that at the core of your
being these statements are true allow
yourself to drift off to sleep with the sound of my voice if you wish through
acceptance comes freedom and peace
I allow my thoughts to be what they are
I have the strength to accept what I perceive to be a challenge or an
obstacle
I trust that challenges will make me stronger
I allow life to be exactly what it is I
