hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation this meditation will help you to harness
positive energy achieve deep relaxation and sink into inner peace my name is jason
stevenson and during this evening session i will guide you to mindfully ease both
mind and body before we journey deep into a healing salt cave
there is nothing you need to know for this practice and nothing you need to actively achieve
simply let the words offered here guide you back into your innate
sense of balance wholeness and presence
to begin tonight's meditation just take a moment to ensure that you are as comfortable as you can be
supported by any cushions or pillows that you have available whether on your side or on your back
ensure that your spine is long and your neck is aligned with your spine
you may close your eyes now if you haven't already done so and then just take a few moments to let
your mind catch up to the present moment paying attention to what it feels like
to be right here right now
you might notice the felt sensation of the mattress beneath you or the blankets that cover you
or you might open your awareness to the sounds that filter through your ears
alternatively you might arrive mentally in this present moment by noticing what
it feels like to breathe observing the subtle expansion and contraction that occurs with each breath
whatever sensations help you to arrive in the present moment just spend a few moments noticing them
without judgment
notice if the mind wants to label your experience as good or bad
right or wrong and then simply let those labels go as you breathe out
coming back to the very simple practice of just
noticing [Music]
and now take a moment to notice your physical body beginning by drawing your attention to
the top of your head from here gently start to scan your body
downwards noticing if there are any areas of tension that you might be able to soften
or release
just simply let any physical tension start to dissolve into the surface beneath you
as if it were melting away
as we move through this practice you will likely notice that from time to time
negative thoughts worries or other unhelpful ideas and images might
rise to your awareness these fearful or negative thought patterns are
the very things that stand in the way of our experiencing deep peace
positivity and relaxation now what typically happens when negative
or worried thoughts arise is one of two things first we might find
ourselves becoming completely swept up by these mental stories
when we are not mindful of these thought patterns they can weigh heavily on our sense of
well-being and then a second type of relationship
we might have with these thoughts is one of avoidance and suppression
avoidance and suppression however are not long-term solutions to troublesome or racing thoughts
if what we are after is deep peace positivity and contentment we must first
cultivate a more nourishing balanced relationship with our thoughts
and from here we can explore the possibility of welcoming positive energy and ideas into our
consciousness so as thoughts arise during this
meditation i invite you to witness these occurrences as if you were an
outside observer of them rather than being caught up in the stream itself
consider that you are standing at the side of the riverbank watching mental objects come
and watching them go
practice this for a few moments on your own now before we move deeper into our salt cave visualization
to cultivate positive energy and a deep sense of peace simply observe
any thoughts that arise with care and maintaining a subtle gap between
them and yourself
if certain thoughts seem to have a heavy pull you might alternatively guide these
thoughts down to the center of your heart to be released focusing your attention
on this loving center in your chest
now to cleanse yourself more completely before we step into our visualization
i invite you to take three long deep breaths and releasing with a soft sigh through
the mouth on each exhalation
after that final exhalation let your breath return to its natural rhythm
and your attention to turn towards the creative capacity of your mind
[Music]
within your creative mental space you find yourself now on a rural road
both sides lined with summer trees in full blossom aromas of jasmine and lavender dance
through the air filling your heart and mind with each full breath
the dirt road you are on heads north weaving through the fertile land in the
direction of a sweet sanctuary a salt cave spa
where you will rest deeply for the night to come all you carry with you is a small
backpack of belongings an open mind and a vibrant heart
slowly and gently you walk down the country road in the direction of the peaceful retreat
absorbing the natural landscape that holds you
as you journey you admire the vibrancy and vitality of this summer season
you note the pastel purple blossoms in the trees the shimmering meadows and the rich
healthy farmland that has been well cared for
butterflies flitter from wildflower to wildflower filling the open air with beauty and
wonder
far into the distance way beyond the furthest trees
the sun begins its descent warm orange glow is cast upon the land
as the earth spins away from the sun for another day you let your entire body be bathed in
its warm
it doesn't take long before the spa comes into view the salt cave sanctuary is housed in a
grand stone mansion built some centuries ago
it is covered in whispering vines and rambling roses the gardens surrounding it are wild yet
still well tendered the place is soothing inviting a wave of surrender to wash
through your body and mind
you make your way closer to the entrance soon arriving on the front porch
before entering you take a moment to say good night to the setting sun
you revel in the orange pink light that appears above the tree line
and then gently you make your way inside
you have arrived after regular check-in hours and so a key has been left out for you
picking it up you notice that the tag reads salt sweet three and then you follow the
hallway that leads to your room
the dimly lit spa hallway is infused with the sweet smell of orange oil
the soft candles fastened to the walls add an air of elegance while guiding you toward the room that
will be yours for the coming night
as you reach salt suite 3 you let yourself in with the key
unveiling a beautiful softly lit bedroom and another door that leads down to your
very own salt cave [Music]
upon the bed is a cotton robe dropping your backpack and taking off
your shoes you prepare yourself for restorative evening ahead
and change into the cozy robe
before you enter the door to the salt cave you notice a jug of lemon water has been
placed out before you you pour yourself a small glass and then
raise it to your lips feeling the properties of both water and
lemon cleansing hydrating and alkalizing your body
as you sip you feel yourself coming into a deeper state of balance
both mentally and physically
now you decide to head into the salt cave and as you open the door to enter
you are faced with a set of stairs lit by the soft glow of smoldering candles
you take a long deep breath in
and letting it go with the sigh
and then you begin your descent step by step
[Music] with each step you take you feel your mind growing more relaxed
and your heart growing wider
your body softens too your forehead jaw and shoulders
all melting towards the wooden stairs beneath your feet [Music]
a warm amber glow from the bottom of the staircase entrances you sending a rippling wave of warmth and
positivity through your cells
and as you reach that lower level your jaw drops at the side of it
the cave-like room covered in soft pink salt the walls are made of salt as
is the floor beneath you as you step off that final stair it feels as if you
are stepping onto a beautiful soothing beach
all around you small candles are lit radiating an orange glow through salt
candle holders and through the air of the room you
notice that sweet smell of orange oil once again
you take a long full breath in slowly letting it go as a subtle smile
stretches across your face
in the center of the room a cushion and blanket rest
you make your way towards them and then rest your back on the soothing nourishing salt
your head rests on the pillow and you lay the blanket across your body from the neck down
arms rest by your sides your feet fall outwards naturally
and your entire body surrenders into the salt crystals beneath you
[Music] candlelight flickers against the walls
and ceiling of the cave guiding you into a calm and tranquil
state of being
now you become more acutely aware of the music that flows through the cave
sounds that work on an energetic level to cleanse both body and mind and to
uplift and nourish your vibration
as the sounds permeate your cells all worries all
fears all limiting beliefs
begin to untangle themselves falling away from your body and into the
salt beneath you for transformation you
feel the warmth of the coarse salt against your body it unwraps you holding you
unconditionally against the earth the air you breathe is enriched with
salt too rejuvenating your entire being with each breath
you soften your belly and relax your shoulders even further allowing each breath to flow as deep as
it comfortably reaches
[Music] you imagine each breath extending out from your lungs
traveling deep into any parts of you that are in need of care and nourishment
focusing in on any particular area of concern whether of mind or body you direct the
breath to that part of you letting each inhalation bring with it fresh regenerative
positive energy
and each exhalation to free you of limiting or negative thoughts
the salt cave absorbs everything that no longer serves you working its alchemical magic to restore
any heavy energy to its original pure state
continue to breathe here to bathe in the soothing sounds of the salt cave
and to sink into the crystals beneath
you
the candles continue to burn casting that soft orange light across the cave
your own body too absorbs the healing glow as the candles flicker gently they
bestow upon you an extra wave of love light and positivity
you are growing tired now nearly ready to surrender to the night completely
though there is a bed upstairs waiting you you long to rest where you are to sleep amidst the salt
crystals and to continue absorbing their positive soothing energy as you slumber
you take a moment now to make any final adjustments to your position so that you can drift away effortlessly
and then you close your eyes to the salt cave slipping into the empty spaciousness
within you
the beautiful music continues to flow through your ears carrying you softly into sleep
you drift away slowly feeling love and warmth pervading mind body and spirit
you know there is nothing left for you to do but to let go to sink further and further into a deep
night of peace ease and tranquility
your breath and the sound vibrations carry you there until soon
you find that you have arrived in the world of sweet and restorative dreams
good night my friend good night
