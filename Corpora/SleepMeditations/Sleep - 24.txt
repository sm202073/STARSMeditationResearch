hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this divinely inspired
nighttime meditation it's a meditation designed to help you connect with three
of your spirit guides and to then surrender effortlessly into sleep allow
my voice to guide you through this journey opening your heart and the
highest mind to the figures and messages that you are meant to encounter here so
begin to soften your breath as we prepare for the otherworldly exploration
before we begin I invite you to bring your body to a lying-down position that
is entirely comfortable for you you may like put just your positioning with
cushions and blankets warming and supporting yourself in any way you need
just take a moment to gently scan the body releasing any constrictions you
might come across
perhaps in the belly the shoulders your
neck or your furrowed
softly invite the entire body to relax its posture as you open the chest gently
take a few deep breaths here to settle into this position
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] now draw your awareness to the physical
body by tuning into your sense of touch
without moving become more highly aware of the physical world that holds you
notice the sensations present beneath your body at every inch of skin that is
in contact with the surface below you [Music]
expand your awareness by noting other physical sensations such as the way
clothing or blankets feel against your body all the way the air around you
touches your skin [Music]
without judgment and without searching for anything simply practice opening
your awareness to whatever the present state of your reality is
draw your awareness deeper now tapping into a more visceral awareness of the
physical body is it possible to observe
any sensations or movements of energy within the cellular body can you sense
the energetic body
draw your awareness to your breath and begin to notice the way the outside
world enters your inner world by the way of this life force observe any
sensations that are present as you inhale and exhale
notice if perhaps this awareness begins to dissolve the gap between the outer
and inner world bringing you closer to a sense of harmony and balance feel
yourself becoming more deeply connected to everything around you as you continue
to breathe [Music]
[Music] now tune in once again to the surface
beneath you and imagine for a moment that there are sturdy roots beginning to
grow from all the places that make contact with the earth feel these roots
expanding permeating the surface beneath you and then slowly breaking through the
rich dense soil beneath the earth's surface
[Music] as you ground yourself into the physical
world this way observe yourself being nourished by the nutrients and lifeforce
that rise through these roots see if you
can feel these roots feeding you supporting you and protecting you as you
begin to feel more and more grounded in the space you are in
gently allow this visual to dissolve knowing that the earth still supports
you even without your attention held on it
shift your attention now by drawing your awareness to the crown of your head feel
into the lightness that is present here noticing perhaps a white or golden glow
occupying the space where your mind and physical body meets the universe
[Music]
open your awareness to the invisible universal energies that permeate your
being through your crown perhaps visualizing this descending
energy as a golden thread as it enters
your body this divine energy makes its way to every corner of your inner world
inspiring and enlightening all aspects of your being rest in silence for a
moment to observe this healing energy and lighten and inspire your entire
being
between the earthly energies and the cosmic ones you are now coming to
witness your being as both human and divine both grounded and expansive just
take one moment to observe this intermingling of the earthly in
spiritual realms and then allow all visuals of this healing energy to
disappear leaving behind a sense of deep connection to everything that exists
around you [Music]
awareness of the spiritual realm has now been unlocked you are open and nearly
prepared for the journey you will soon make towards your spirit guides as we
proceed with this movement into the spirit world I invite you to remember
that you are always in control of this journey if at any point you feel
uncomfortable or simply wishing to take your newfound knowledge back to your
body you're always welcome to come back to the physical world by returning to
your breath your breath is always available to anchor you to the present
moment and will help guide you into a deep and restful sleep please know that
you are entirely supported on this journey that the universe is offering
unconditional love and support to you in this very moment just take a moment now
to feel into this Universal energy by
returning to your breath for a few moments of silence as you inhale feel
your body and spirit being nourished with healing waves of energy
and as you exhale feel yourself being cleared of all stagnant energy all fear
all negativity and all that holds you
back from your truest self open your
heart to trust to healing and to awakening
if thoughts arise at any point simply observe their presence and then gently
release them as you come back to your breath and your awareness of the spirit
world the crown has been opened and you
are now prepared to meet with your spirit guides so let us slowly ascend to their realm
with eyes remaining closed draw your awareness to the space between your
brows this energetic region of the body
often referred to as the third eye hold
your capacity for higher perception it
is the center of your intuition insight and wisdom just hold your attention here
for just a moment
and then slowly begin to envision a
mystical and enchanted forest appearing within this space
[Music]
[Music] continue to breathe deeply as you
visualized the trees shrubs vines and
flowers begin to grow here
expand your awareness to observe the insects that circulate through soil and
air
and the animals that call this place home
allow this place to penetrate your soul enveloping you with a sense of peace and
comfort and joy you to feel at home in
this space so take your time to explore whatever is here
[Music]
out of the dense forest ahead of you you notice a pathway beginning to clear as
if beckoning you to move deeper into the woods
you feel safe and secure venturing that way so you begin to tread mindfully down
the path
notice the way the earth feels beneath your feet and the way the forest air
feel was your lungs
just ahead of you along the path you notice a bright white figure beginning
to appear it is somewhat like a human form but is radiating in otherworldly
energy [Music]
deep in your bones you know that this is your first spirit guide you continue to
move towards this spirits direction feeling drawn to whatever messages you
are now sensing our present here
take your time to observe this figure as you approach what energy does he or she
exude what might he or she have to share
[Music]
finally you reach your spirit guide standing just before him or her you gaze
into one another's eyes and through them your guide speaks listen closely to what
is offered here without searching for anything simply open yourself to the
teachings that are being offered open
your heart as divine messages filter into your soul
[Music]
[Music]
your guide extends his or her hand to you and you reach for it you sense there
is another figure this spirit would like you to meet and so together you move
further into the woods as you walk you
are infused with your spirits energy becoming more empowered and inspired
with each step that you take together
see if you can feel all of your cells coming to life awakening to the truths
that are being offered to you
[Music] and once again you notice another
beaming figure of light just ahead of you on this path take your time as you
slowly move your way towards it observing whatever energies or
characteristics are noticeable as you approach
[Music]
as you look into the eyes of this second spirit guide you feel a great sense of
peace and calm come over you
this spirit like the first speaks at a
higher frequency than the earthly realm is accustomed to blessing you with this
new inside take a few moments to rest
with this spirit allowing the messages he or she offers to permeate your entire
being [Music]
now with each of these mystical spirits on either side of you you know that there
is one final guide you are meant to meet on this journey the three of you
continue walking slowly and mindfully through the dense and enchanted woods
that surround you continue to breathe in
the fresh forest air allowing it to reach all the way to the depths of your
belly tune in once again to the textures
and colors of the woods mindfully observing all the mystical creatures and
plants that bring everlasting life to this place
[Music]
finally in the clearing ahead of you you
see the third and final figure of light
the spirit is glowing with arms stretched forward warmly you make your
way towards this spirit feeling instantly renewed awakened and welcomed
and as you finally meet this divine body of energy you reach your hands forward
to meet theirs as you look into this
third spirits eyes you are instantly filled with light peace love and clarity
take a few moments to bathe in this experience allowing the highest message
to come to you open your heart to
whatever it is you need to hear right here right now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
in this clearing within the woods you and your three spirit guides come to
form a circle hand in hand take a moment
to look towards the first who came to you sinking more deeply into the message
he or she had offered you [Music]
[Music]
now shift your gaze to the second spirit you met remembering the bits of insights
that were infused into your being upon your encounter
[Music]
and finally gaze into the eyes of the third and final spirit opening your
heart to whatever was presented to you allow this final message to mingle for a
few moments with your entire being
[Music]
take a moment to thank each of your spirit guides
and then gently allow them to dissipate back into the air of these enchanted
woods know that they have not left you but they are always always within
[Music] gently allow the entire forest to melt
away as you draw your awareness back to your physical body
[Music] notice once again the feeling of the bed
or other support system beneath you and
then reconnect with your breath to help ground you back into this physical
reality nestled into the cushions and
blankets that are there around you allowing them to bring warmth to body
and spirit [Music]
the messages that were offered may continue to linger for a short time but
soon I invite you to surrender them back
to the universe for the night knowing that they are never very far away
let all thoughts go as you come back down to this very moment in time there
is nothing you need to witness in this moment aside from your body as it slowly
surrenders into sleep
the positive and powerful insights you have encountered will return tomorrow
but for now allow the body heart mind
and solve the risk deeply into the physical world
with your spirit guides always around you you can rest with ease knowing that
you are supported unconditionally throughout this lifetime allow the
following affirmation to lull you to sleep repeating these words silently and
softly as you inch closer and closer towards a restorative slumber the
universe supports me the universe supports me the universe supports me
