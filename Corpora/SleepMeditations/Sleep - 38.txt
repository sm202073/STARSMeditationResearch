[Music]
hello this is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation
designed to help you release what you've been holding on to and to help ease you
into a deep and restorative night's sleep the intention behind this
meditation is to help you to let go of that which you have been clinging on to
surrendering it to a higher force through this process of letting go
you're free up misplaced energy finding a greater sense of lightness freedom and
pure state of being this mysterious and
often misunderstood force to which your surrender may feel or sound like the
word God or universal energy or consciousness or it may be by some other
name that is comfortable and familiar to you you may even choose to leave it
unnamed whatever the case this idea of a
force simply points towards the energy that makes all of this life possible
whatever term or non term becomes your guiding force for this meditation is
entirely welcomed and accepted this energy will be the bed that
nourishes you throughout the duration of this meditation and all the way into
your sleep this recording is designed to be an anchor before bedtime for a
consecutive 21 days over the course of these three weeks you will be repeatedly
guided to let go of that which no longer serves you allowing the transformative
powers of some higher force to nurture hold and awaken every level of your
being before we begin I invite you now to ensure that all end of day activities
are taken care of lights are switched off ringers are silenced and blinds are
drawn make your way into a comfortable
lying down position using any cushions and blankets required to support you
through this transformative journey and then into a deep and restful sleep make
any adjustments necessary allowing your body to begin the process of relaxation
feeling yourself sink a little bit further into the surface that support
you throughout this journey as is the
case with any meditation you may experience rising emotions or other
challenging sensations if these waves come to you know that is
safe to feel into them allow the space that holds you the air that surrounds
you and the force that lives within you to carry you through whatever arises
just surrender these energies to the higher power that supports all of life
note that each day of this meditation will be set against a different emotional backdrop know that from day to
day this meditation will feel and look unique as you process it in your own
natural way know that whatever arises is entirely okay and that whatever comes up
is in fact required to be seen in order for you to move through it and finally
know that you are unconditionally supported through this journey [Music]
take a moment now to connect with your breath without attempting to change it
in any way simply notice its natural rhythm in this very moment
[Music]
notice the way that without any action on your part the breaths innate wisdom
guides itself into the body gently and back out to the world around you allow
your breath to be your anchor into the present moment throughout this process of letting go
for a few breaths now bring your awareness to your belly
simply observe this part of the body and notice that wherever your attention
flows the breath goes to witness the
natural rise and fall of the stomach with each inhalation and each exhalation
notice the body becoming more relaxed with each deep breath taken and feel
that sinking further into this space that support you
take a moment to bring awareness to the truth that just by being here in this
very moment you are already beginning the process of releasing by allowing the
body to rest deeply into this present moment you are immersed within the
journey of releasing limited notions that have been carried for quite some
time with your attention turn towards
each breath you are continuously being grounded into the present moment
surrendering your thoughts to that which exists all around you to cosmic energy
to the source of all life
throughout this meditation your mind may become subject to wondering if this is
the case in any moment simply observe this tendency of the mind to lose its
focus to wander into the past or into the future and into deeply entrenched
beliefs about yourself or about life in general and know that this movement is
entirely natural observe each mental
shift away from the present moment with compassion and non judgment as humans
with the capacity for self consciousness it is entirely natural for the mind to
wander now if it's here and not to reject or deny these movements but to
simply observe them and then to guide awareness back to the breath or some
other anchor to the present moment
[Music] with each mental meandering that arises
simply witness it and then guide your attention back to your breath or to the
sound of my voice take a few moments
here to gently follow the breath allowing it to guide you further into
this present moment releasing any mental
notions of the past present or future
simply allow yourself to be right here
right now
[Music]
letting go requires a complete surrender of our mental energy often this process
brings up uncomfortable sensations and deep feelings of fear whatever we have
been holding on to has become interwoven with our experience and expectation of
happiness letting go requires us to surrender into the deep and knowing that even without
whatever beliefs ideas people or objects we have been clinging to we are entirely
whole entirely loved and entirely free
our attempts to control the world around us are born out of fear fear that we may
not receive enough love or money or safety or nourishment or anything
else for that matter through exerting control we often believe that we can
ensure that our future will play out the way we hope for it to letting go of this
belief requires a leap of faith a leap into knowing that everything we
require will be provided by this cosmic force greater than us
take a moment once again to tune in to the breath acknowledging any sensations
feelings or emotions that may be rising
simply witness these uprisings if they present themselves as passing waves that
do not belong to you allow them to come and allow them to go without fixating on
any mental ideas about what they are why they are there or what their purpose is
simply observe them without thought
without judgment and with unconditional acceptance and compassion
the act of surrender requires what may feel like a courageous leap into the
unknown and yet on the other side of
this leap is the sensation of freedom
by letting go of our attempts to control or to manipulate the world around us we
release vast stores of energy this
energy does not disappear from us but instead repurposes itself energy that
was once tied up in fear becomes energy intertwined with love trust and peace
take a moment now to come into the body due to the intricate interconnection of
mind and body we can help to ease the mind and support its surrender through
release and relaxation of the body just
continue to follow my voice as we journey now through the body with each
body part mentioned allow your attention to flow there allow each area to be
infused with breath with warmth and with love allow each area to release any
tension it may be carrying
begin by drawing your awareness to your toes gently feeling into them softening them
with your awareness [Music]
regarde and release now both feet [Music]
the ankles
the lower legs softening
your knees [Music]
and your upper legs
witnessin release any remaining tension within the entirety of both legs now
draw your attention to and relax the buttocks
pelvis
your hips
release now your belly softening let go
[Music]
you'll lower back and gently move up the spine to soften
the entirety of the back
allow the chest to soften and the heart to relax
[Music]
draw your awareness upwards along both arms beginning at the tips of your
fingers slowly softening each part of
the arm along your journey upwards
when you arrive at the shoulders take a moment to witness and relax both
shoulders and the entirety of both your arms
soften now the Nick both front and back
release any tension in the jaw
the mouth
your cheeks
knows
your ears
and your eyes and the eye sockets
soften the eyebrows and the phorid
and then witness and relax the top of the head
the back of your head relaxing
and now your entire head gently softening letting go
take a moment now to observe the whole body feeling it melt into the surface
beneath it and as the body relaxes more deeply
notice how the mind follows
take a few deep breaths you allowing both body and mind to continue sinking
into the universal energy that supports them
as you continue your personal journey of letting go know that you are deeply
supported by the higher force that exists around and within you this
all-knowing and ever-present energetic force is a safe loving and
supportive container capable of holding and transforming all mental beliefs
stories and attachments this divine energy and its support can be called
upon at any point to assist with your individual process take a moment now to
bring your awareness to the heart space [Music]
it may be helpful to slowly envision the mind descending melting into the non
thinking space of your heart
begin now to breathe from the heart allowing it to expand on each inhalation
and soften on each exhalation
[Music]
through the heart we are better able to recognize our connection to this oneness
that supports all of life by allowing
your mind to descend and melt away we begin to operate from the hearts knowing
from this deep faith and trust in the universe through the heart we operate
from a knowing that there is no need to control the world around us and there is
no need to latch on to anything we begin
to feel into the safety and support that is always present and available to us
as you slowly edge further towards sleep allow your breath to rock you into a
deeply transformative state of relaxation where this surrendering
process will continue each breath guides
you back to the present moment each mindful breath is an act of
surrender
by releasing any mental beliefs we carry we allow ourselves to come further into
the body into the breath and into the feeling of this present moment by
releasing the stories of our past and the beliefs about our present and our future we break overly used energy
patterns so that we may repurpose our energetic stores the use by our highest
and most divinely connected selves feel into the freedom the love and the peace
that presents itself by way of this sweet surrender I invite you now to
gently introduce a few words to help reaffirm this process of letting go and
to guide you into sleep
through each breath cycle begin to repeat it is safe to let go it is safe
to let go allow these words to gently
guide you towards a deeply restorative slumber with each breath cycle feel
yourself surrendering even a little deeper still it is safe to let go it is
safe to let go
allow these words to carry you for as long as necessary and soon you will find
yourself easing peacefully into sleep the surrender will continue throughout
the night while your whole body and mind rest peacefully gently releasing your
attachments freeing your energy and filling your innermost being with
freedom peace and lightness it is safe
to let go it is safe to let go it is
safe to let go
it is safe to let go
it is safe to let go
it is safe to let go
it is safe
