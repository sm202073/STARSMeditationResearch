hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this guided before sleep
meditation prepare to be taken on a journey of pure deep relaxation as you
connect with your senses and engage with your inner treasures learning from your
past present and future moments to
experience all the benefits of this guided meditation lie down and get comfortable for a peaceful night of
sleep make sure that you will not be disturbed as you settle into a position
where you can lie comfortably for the duration of this recording close your
eyes and prepare for a deep sense of relaxation sleep and well-being
[Music]
remember that this is your time a chance for you to escape from the problems of
everyday life to allow the tensions of the day to dissipate and to connect with
your inner self with your eyes closed breathe deeply and slowly through your
nose and then slowly exhale through your mouth allowing any tension within you to
disperse as the breath leaves your body
[Music] now inhale again breathing in slowly
through your nose to a count of four feel the air entering your lungs and
extend your diaphragm as you do so enabling the air to reach into the bottom of your lungs once you've done
that hold the breath for two seconds and then slowly exhale through your mouth to
a count of four once more so it's breathing in for four holding for two
counts and breathing out for four this is called rhythmic breathing and it will
help you to absorb the techniques required to help you breathe your way through any tensions and to be able to
release any worries anxieties or physical tensions each time on the
out-breath I'll give you a few moments to do this [Music]
now breathe normally in and out through your nose feeling the tension leaving
your body as you continue to do so your
arms and legs will start to feel heavier and you should feel the back of the chair or the mattress supporting your
body as you let all of the tension go if
you still feel areas of tension within your body deliberately tighten up those
areas holding the muscle tension and then release and feel the difference as
your muscles relaxed feel the tension leaving your body as it does so
so tighten and release relaxing further and deeper into your meditative state
[Music]
you [Music]
continue the cycle of breath as you imagine walking on a beautiful sandy
beach
the sand is shimmering under the gentle but warm rays of an early Sun there is a
subtle breeze that's teasing your hair and soft against your skin the sky is a
beautiful blue cloudless and stretches forever sinking only onto a distant
horizon where the sea and the sky unite in a matching Azur color you feel
relaxed free and look around you take in
the most beautiful picture postcard scene you were sitting in a sheltered
Cove with glorious cliffs reaching up into the sky providing a secure backdrop
to this perfect scene the rocky cliffs
glimmer gray and red with the warming intensity of the Sun and you catch
glimpses of white feathers as seabird soar and dive circling on rising
thermals distant bird songs filter
through the air and the piercing cause of seagulls swooping high and low over
the gentle waves brings back childhood memories of seaside escapades
a light breeze whips across the sandy
cove and the Sun burns even brighter in the sky you stand up and walk along the
coastline dealing the warm sand on the soles of your feet and through your toes
frothy waves wash up onto the beach and in the distance white sailing boats
drift by the feeling is one of peace as
you walk along the golden sands you see up ahead what seems like a gentle
homeless man with a small dog walking on the edge of the lapping waters he's
looking up to the sky muttering to himself and calling out to the seagulls
clothed in tattered pants and a white baggy shirt with an overgrown beard
carrying two bags of what looks like clothes and blankets he approaches you
in turns and speaks directly to you your treasure chest is near in a deep cavern
his voice trails off as he passes you however a breeze picks up and you hear
his final words riches beyond belief you
turn to see him once more however as you do this he and his dog are nowhere to be
seen
you sit for a moment on the sandy beach to collect your thoughts wondering what
that was all about his words echo inside your head your treasure chest is near
riches beyond belief getting up from the
sand you are drawn to a cliff face opposite the beach that appears to have
a cave carved within it out of curiosity
you begin to move towards it clambering carefully over small rocks strewn out
into their ever reaching tides you wander through small rock pools feeling
the coolness of the water on your feet the beach cave looks welcoming and as
you approach the rocks have been smoothed as if by hand and you reach out
and trail your fingers against the entrance to the cavern walls there is a
coolness in places and in others the rocks are warm to the touch where the
Sun touches them
as you take in the scene in front of you and move forward you see dappling light around the walls
of the cave mesmerizing welcoming and intriguing the temperature within the
entrance dips immediately but it isn't cold it feels nice to be out of the
sunlight for a while marvel at the contours of the beach cave in front of
you pockets of stone walkways smooth walls
with a contrast of light and dark as small gaps in the rock face allow the
Sun to penetrate the darkened depths the
beach cave has a strange almost spiritual feel to it peaceful and
tranquil and yet it feels as if it has had a purpose not simply carved by the
elements but by loving hands smoothing the stone into submission the sound of
water can be heard echoing from deeper into the cave although the tide is
gently lapping along the rocks leading to the cave entrance inside the low
rocks are dry so no danger from an encroaching tide the temperature changes
as you move deeper into the labyrinth of cavernous rooms a carved archway lies
ahead of you and the cave room within flickers and sparkles with flecks of
green as you move into the deeper part of the cavern you hear the words once
more vibrating throughout the cave your treasure is near in a cavern riches beyond belief
you're drawn to move forward and enter a space so soothing and peaceful that you
feel any remaining tension dissipate to your right deeper within the cave you
see what looks to be a dusty old ornate chest moving to this large old crate
curious to see what this is you blow the dust and sand away it reveals to you
what looks to be an ancient old treasure chest could this be the treasure chest the
homeless man on the beach was referring to treasure nearby you sit in front of
it get comfortable and loosen the already unlocked latches the chest opens
it glistens with gold you see that is divided into three sections they're
marked past present and future and in
each section a small tin boxes [Music]
you glanced into the section of the chest marked past and see a little green
emerald encrusted tin taking this out
easing the lid off slowly you see two folded pieces of paper you unfold the
first piece gently and it has printed in beautiful handwritten calligraphy the
words let go take a moment to meditate
on this what is this telling you is this
something from the past that you need to release and let go of perhaps an old
relationship a habit that no longer serves you for you or your highest good
just take these next few moments to let go and find peace in the release of old
and worn-out patterns [Music]
you decide to read the next piece of paper you gently unfold it and it says
the word forgive you think about this
for a moment have you been harboring some distaste for someone or something that has
happened to you in your past possibly someone who has mistreated you or maybe
you need to forgive yourself and let go of guilt that you have been beating yourself up over for a long time just
spend the next few moments contemplating forgiveness and release any pain you've
held on to this long enough set yourself free
[Music]
you place both of these papers back into the emerald tin putting it gently back
into the chest where you found it as you do this you feel a cool breeze blow
gently throughout the cavern as if clearing away any final thoughts on
letting go and forgiveness
you reach back into the chest and take out a ruby encrusted tin that has been
marked with the word present
excited to open this you peel back the old tin lid to reveal a piece of paper
that says meditate on three things you are grateful for today give thanks for
what you currently have in your life take a moment think this through are you
living with a roof over your head do you have food to eat maybe you have great
friends family or even a loving pet think of three things you are grateful
for in this moment and give thanks true thanks to your higher power within when
we are grateful for all we have more of what we want will show up in our lives
meditate on these words in the next few moments what am i grateful for
[Music]
you place the folded paper back into the ruby encrusted tin placing it back in
the treasure chest before you you reach in and take up the last small box
this one is diamund and crusted it glistens even within the dark cavern
itself it has the words future carved in black on the top of the lid you are
excited to open this one to see what it holds for you and you open it and notice
three pieces of paper within you grab the first one out and slowly unravel it
the words my career seemed to appear as if by magic on this paper you give this
some thought what is it you truly want to do for your working life what would
you want to do if you didn't have to be answerable to anyone envision this take
a few moments to see what you are doing what are other people doing or saying
that tells you that you have achieved this dream possibly you already have
your dream job but want to take a moment to give gratitude be with this for the
next few moments see it feel it be it
[Music]
you place this little piece of paper back in the diamond tin and reach in to
grab the other piece of paper opening it up slowly the words relationships and
love are written what does this mean for
you is there something or someone you would like to attract into your life
could there be a way that you could better serve a relationship that you are currently in whether that be a
friendship partner or family relationship possibly it's all about a
better relationship with yourself loving and accepting yourself more dig deep in
the next few moments and see this relationship expand and grow into something beautiful
[Music]
[Music]
finally you place this back into the tin and reach in to pull out the final piece
of paper this one says the word health
[Music] you give this one some thought are you
happy with your current health of your body mind and spirit is there something
you could do to help improve your life it will possibly eat less exercise more
meditate more to give yourself peace of mind just take the next few moments to
meditate and sit with this listen out for any directions visions or phrases
that may come to your mind to help give you some clarity in this area of health
[Music]
you place this little tin back in the chest and just before you close it a
breeze tunnels its way through the cavern once more clearing the way for
all that you have discovered to take place in your life you sit for a moment
in gratitude grateful for the homeless man who guided you here and happy that
you have listened to your intuition you leave this treasure chest knowing that
it will be here should you wish to come back to it sometime in the near future you begin to make your way towards the
entrance of the cave and once more you sit for a moment into a stone carved
seat at its entrance
take a moment to breathe in deeply and then release deliberately letting go of
any tension within your muscles deeply relax all of your muscles feel as each
muscle begins to relax let go and if
your body wants to sleep allow it to fall asleep the water sounds from the
beach almost musical in its consistency from your vantage point you become
mesmerised by the beautiful dappled green colors that dab the cave roof or
zipped with an artist's brush consider
how you feel this moment in time our peaceful how wonderful it feels to be
cocooned within this natural place with such peaceful vibrations tell yourself
that you are at peace here you are at one with nature remind yourself that
life is for living for experiencing for discarding old wounds and for embracing
all that lies ahead take a deep breath
in through your nose and then breathe out slowly feeling your body relaxed yet further into the stone carved seat relax
your body's still further feel your body unwinding the muscles growing heavy
total relaxation enveloping you continue
to be aware of the breath and use it to channel relaxation throughout your body
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the warmth from the Sun cocooned your body and brings you back to the present
gently breathe in again deeply and then
exhale ensuring that no areas of tension exist within you enjoy the feeling of
warmth on your skin and the powder blue skies above like a giant canopy
stretching across the open cliff expanse you are centered you retain the feeling
of peace and wonder enjoy the moment and the feeling of harmony as you sit on the
sand and enjoy the last few moments of this meditation before you drift off
into a deep slumber enjoy the Sun warm
against your skin and the gentle breeze playing with your hair breathe in and
then out allowing yourself to drift off
deeper and deeper into a deeply relaxed state remember that you can revisit this
treasure chest cave of spiritual tranquility at any time you need by
simply closing your eyes and allowing the sensations to wash over and embrace
you sleep may be coming now the treasure
chest awaits your next visit with riches beyond belief
