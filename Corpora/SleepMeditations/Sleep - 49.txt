[Music]
greetings my friends my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this sleep
meditation guardians of the rainforest where you will journey deep into the
lush rainforests and your questions will be answered allowing you to drift into a
deep and restful sleep [Music]
just making sure that you are comfortable now completely comfortable
lying on your back with your arms by your side
wriggling around until you get comfortable gently closing your eyes and
using this initial time to take in a number of deep breaths sending that
breath all the way down to your belly area breathing in through your nose and
out through your mouth
as you're breathing in be comfortable
where you are and knowing that you're in the right place at the right time for
this moment
[Music]
[Music]
and returning your breath to a natural comfortable rhythm in and out through
your nose as you do this becoming aware
of the sensations of the breath as it goes into your belly
we feel it expand doesn't leaves your belly you feel your
belly just go down slightly this is not a forced breath or forced
movement rather it's just a reaction a natural reaction to the breath going in
and out moment by moment breath by
breath [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I'd like you to become aware now of your entire body where your body meets the
bed where your heels are resting your
arms and your hands lying by your side and feeling the weight of your body
feeling the sensations of the sheets or blankets against your body or the pillow
supporting your head [Music]
and what I'd like you to do in these next few moments is to allow a body scan
from the top of your head right down slowly to the tips of your toes and as
you scan your body you're going to go along and witness any
sensations that might be happening within various parts of your body now
this may be physical sensations or it may be even stored emotions
it's not about changing anything it's just about being present with your body
your physical sensations and your emotions so scanning now from the top of
your head right down to the tip of your toes and take a few minutes to do this
and I will return
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I'd like you to visualize yourself now entering a lush green rain forest a
place that seems almost magical hundreds
of thousands of years old trees and foliage and a river that meanders to the
right side of you
you begin to go down to this river and walk alongside it as you do paying
attention to the sounds of this river the healing sensations that it delivers
to you
you are at peace here there's no one
else to disturb you only you and nature
each time a thought comes up for you allow that thought to float by and you
might like to project that thought into the river and allow that thought to
trickle downstream actually see that the
thought beginning to be placed into the river and beginning to leave you watch
it as it goes the tune comes to your
mind row row row your boat gently down
the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream
the river and all the stones within the river are here today to have lessons to
teach you gentle lessons reminders
because you already know inherently what it is here to teach you as you continue
to walk up a slanted hill the gentle rivers still rolling along beside you
you hear it whisper to you you already have everything you need it says you
already have everything you need this reminder circulates throughout you at
times you might be striving wanting reaching desiring something else to come
in your life the river is here to tell
you that you are already connected to everything that is and whatever you need
whatever you desire is really only a thought away from your reality it all
begins with a thought you are the co-creator of your life it's
almost like you can let go of the striving this is not by any means being
lazy rather it's simply surrendering to the process and trusting that your
gentle actions are already in place manifesting your desires take a moment
now to visualize the river and put your hands in allow the waters to splash to
your face be grateful for this river and for all
you have within your life at this time you might want to say a silent thank you
as you continue on to move upwards
the Sun peers through the top of the canopy of the rain forest creating
almost a halo effect around you warming you soothing you you can almost feel the
vibration of the cells within your body as they come alive from this beautiful
sunlight you stand still in this place
and allow the sun's rays to sink into your mind your body and spirit
and so you continue
the gentle sounds of the river following you as you continue on your path
you take some time now to sit at the riverbank and allow your feet to soak
within the cool water enjoy the coolness
of the water as it flows between your toes around your feet and feeling the
gravelly earth within the riverbed itself
soothing your feet you might even want to rub them with in this gravelly earth
almost like a massage for your feet
as you look upstream you begin to see a bottle floating down with a note inside
it as it comes closer to you you catch
the bottle and you pour the cork out and read the note as you open up the note
take a look at what it says you read the note the words materialize
almost out of thin air they say you are loved for the uniqueness of who you are
go out there and shine and let it be known to the world
here is another reminder to you that something you inherently already know
and yet sometimes you dismiss this you
don't feel worthy you don't feel that you were good enough well this note is
here to tell you that right now you are loved you are worthy and you are perfect
in this very moment and it's calling out
for you to truly recognize this and to acknowledge this to feel this with all
your entire being and once you acknowledge this you give a mission for
others to light up their lives too for others to recognize the love within
themselves just take a few moments to sit with this
to sit with this love within you you might begin to feel it radiating from
the inside out allowing your body to
grow lighter and shine brighter with every breath in and out
you take this note and you place it back into the bottle and put the cork back on
throwing it back into the river and allowing someone else downstream to
receive the same message you begin to
get up and continue on your journey
[Music]
as you continue on a little squirrel runs past you he stops looks at you you
look at him and even if only for a few moments you connect with him your eyes
meet the squirrel looks peaceful in this
environment content and he's here to
simply remind you that in this moment you're content that you can allow
thoughts of yesterday and worries or concerns of tomorrow to let go because
these are not your reality your reality is only in this present moment this is
your reality right here in this forest now this is your reality you feel this
wonderful connection with this squirrel and he scampers away
you continue on climbing inclines and
steeper Hills the river still below you babbling away
as you reach the top of the hill you see an enormous pine tree with a wooden rope
ladder and you begin to climb this tree you are safe you feel safe up and up you
go [Music]
beginning to be far above the river and this tree continues on even past the top
of the canopy so right now you are up
the top of this tree you see a hammock swinging from branch to branch just the
perfect size for you and decide to spend some time swinging laying down with in
this hammock right above the beautiful lush rainforest you're comforted here
and supported and of course safe just enjoy lying here whilst the Sun
envelops you soothes you and comfort you
[Music]
feel the Sun penetrating right deep down into every cell of your entire body
energizing you healing you on a deep sea
level relaxing you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] just as you are enjoying this sunlight
this gentle swinging of the hammock from high above the forest and the river a
gentle tapping is on your right shoulder and as you open your eyes you see a baby
chimpanzee he looks in your eyes with a joyous smile he just gently pat your
head for a moment and it's like he's communicating directly to you with no
word spoken reminding you of your child within and the joyous times you've had
as a child think of how simple it was no
concerns no worries no problems just happy within that moment at one
particular moment see if you can recall a particular moment as a child when you
were happy recall what it felt like see
if you can pinpoint where that joy sprung from that excitement and he's
here to remind you that this joy this inner child this happiness is always
within you and you may sometimes need to take a little more time out to connect
with this joy to do what pleases you to
do what makes you smile and to look after that little girl or boy that is
within you and has always been within you
do what makes this little child feel happy and you can carry this back into
your waking life the chimpanzee looks at
you with a mischievous grin and he bounds away swinging from one vine to
the next calling out as he goes you
decide to have one last look around at the top of this canopy before you begin
to climb back down the wooden rope ladder as you go down thanking the
mischievous monkey breeze lessons on your inner child
you finally reach the floor of the forest and continue now on your journey
beginning to go downhill again getting closer and closer to the riverbank
as you continue downwards towards the river you see an old man sitting in the
seat it's a carved out wooden log the seat
that has probably been here for centuries
he's a frail old man and he turns to see you he motioned you to come and sit with
him and he has a glint of joy within his eyes he says to you just for this moment
be still no thoughts needed just be
still and enjoy the sounds of the beautiful rainforest around you and so
you sit with him and begin to listen and
it's like the sounds of the rainforest a magnified a symphony of nature to your
ears just enjoy these next few moments
[Applause]
you turn to look at the frail old man and he reminds you never be afraid to
take time out to do nothing because in
that nothingness there is everything that you need contained there you acknowledge this and
you say goodbye to the old man and you continue on your journey
as you continue on the meandering path alongside the river the sounds of water
gushing begin to get louder and louder it seems like there is a large waterfall
ahead excitedly you continue to move
towards the sound
the sound gets louder and begins to wash all over you reverberating through your
entire body as you turn a corner a giant
waterfall is seen
a large cavern behind the 100-foot waterfall water cascading way above your
head it's just you here you and the waterfall
and nature
you edged yourself close to the waterfall and put your arm underneath it
you can feel the heaviness of the water as a pounds against your arms and hands
it's cool but not too cold you see a
little trail that leads behind the cavern of this giant waterfall and you
decide to go under this and from here
you can see the water pounding right in front of you splashing down to the rocks
and the river below
this waterfall is here to remind you of the strength you have within any
obstacles that come forth in your life but you have this power within to
overcome them to see them through no matter how dark these times may be this
strength this inner strength can overcome almost any obstacle set before
you and if there is an obstacle that can't be moved just like the waterfall it just travels
around it and moves onwards not stopping not fearing just continuing to move with
the flow of life you are how you are
strength just be with this for a moment and allow the water to fall reminding
you of all the strength you have all your ever need is right within you right
at this moment
you head on now back out from under the cabin back in the direction where you
came you thank the waterfowl for the
reminder as you begin to follow the river back downstream going with the
flow of life
you continue on with in the forest with
the flow of the river passing the old man once more still seated on the carved
out wooden chair you acknowledge each other and move on you pass the wooden rope
ladder again a chimpanzee the squirrel
and just as you begin to get closer to the edge of the forest a Sun shower begins to fall gently down
rather than running from this you rejoice in this and look upwards and see
this water gently coming down and refreshing you reminding you to
surrender to life but whatever comes up for you to not try and force things
aside to not try and push motions down
[Music] but rather to acknowledge everything
that happens and surrender to it allow
it to be and this makes your job in life so much easier
so much more comfortable and joyous
it's almost like you can use life as your playground you don't have to
tighten your grip on anything it just be enjoy whatever happens at any point in
given time allow it to be and in
allowing it to be as it is it gives you so much power and strength you're
acknowledging this present moment you
won't have to get lost in the past or in the future within your mind
these can be waste of time and this is all you have right here and
now so just stand here and allow this
gentle Sun shower to wash away old thoughts or remaining concern and be
truly present
coming back now you're leaving the forest as you do take one more moment to
glance back and to thank the forest for all it has offered you today but every
reminder that it has given you right now
you're returning to your body where you can continue on begin to sleep and with
the knowing that right now there is nothing else that needs to be done you
can sleep be present and allow yourself
to enjoy these moments and anything that needs to be done trust that it will be
done in the coming days it's all ok it's
your time it's your time to rest to rest your body your mind your spirit
[Music] sleep well my friend sleep well
