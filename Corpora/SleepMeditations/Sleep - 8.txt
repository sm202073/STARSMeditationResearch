my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation
that will help you to wisely let go of any anger you might be
experiencing before sleep when held onto anger can inhibit us from feeling into
our innate sense of peace and our capacity for compassion
and so by becoming mindful of this emotion and addressing it thoughtfully we can
loosen its grip and uncover a new way forward
so to begin this bedtime meditation take your time to get settled in for the night ensure that your spine is
long and straight and your neck becoming an extension of it and then
allow your limbs to relax and fall however they are
comfortable close your eyes as you turn your
attention inwards and then note what it feels like to be held by the surface beneath you
what does it feel like to be tethered by the weight of gravity
what does the mattress or other surface beneath you feel like against your skin
without judging your experience see if you can simply become more intimate with
the physical space you rest in
and once you feel grounded and completely connected to the physical world i invite
you to shift your attention to the air around you you might notice the
sensation of it against your cheeks or you might observe the way it
slowly enters and exits the body as your breath
as each breath fills you you're provided with life-supporting oxygen
offered to us by the plant kingdom and with each breath out we return this
gift to the plant life in the form of carbon
dioxide spend a few moments with your breath now noting how
effortless this exchange this flow is
see if you can allow the chest the shoulders
and the belly to soften facilitating the flow of the breath and perhaps inviting it
a little bit deeper
now as we dive into this process of releasing the energy of anger
it is worthwhile to begin by softening out judgments of this emotion
in and of itself anger is neither good nor bad it is simply a reaction
we experience to various circumstances or events in our life what we do
with our anger is another thing when left to fest inside or when
released mindlessly upon those around us anger can hurt more than it heals
however we can also choose to use anger as a signpost for what we value
for the direction we wish to move in our lives
only when we begin by softening our judgment and opening to this experience with
more care and curiosity do we enable ourselves to discover a new
way forward so right now i invite you to take a
moment to draw your attention to your heart space the center of your chest
and as you breathe envision the heart expanding energetically with each
breath in and softening its toughest barriers with
each breath out
with each breath that moves through the heart imagine your judgments of this emotion
relaxing as you create more space for it to unravel in a healing and a cleansing way
if stories about rightness or wrongness come to mind
simply note these as they appear and then release with an out breath for example if we
notice ourselves feeling righteous or holding on to the wrong doings of another we might invite
these to soften if only just for a moment
and this does not mean you'll not be called to take certain wise action in daily life
but for now harboring the energy of this anger is likely of little benefit
so continue to come back to the breath again and again as needed expanding as you
inhale and softening or releasing as you exhale
before we move into the visualization that will help us to cleanse any held anger for the coming night
i invite you to mindfully inquire into the energy that lives beneath your anger
the energy that this anger arises from
sometimes our anger comes from the mind as a yearning to be right
or as a defensive reaction other times it arises from our values
from care and concern about someone or something
and even sometimes it's a mix of these two things a blend of mental and intuitive
responses to the world around us so i invite you to take a few moments to
compassionately curiously and non-judgmentally inquire into the energies beneath
or behind the raw experience of anger and just hold yourself gently as you
explore this noting to what extent you might be reacting in defense
and to what extent this emotion may be rising out of love
when you awaken into another day you can use this self-knowledge to help you
navigate your anger in a way that is conducive of deep healing
on an individual and collective level but for now let's take some time to just
let it all go to reaffirm that in this moment
we are well that in this moment we can best serve ourselves by inviting
our anger to dissolve so take a moment now to come back to
your breath for a few cycles
use the breath or the body as an anchor for your attention any time you find your mind wandering
that does not serve you in this moment just bring it back focusing back on your breathing
and once you feel centered i invite you to bring your attention to the creative capacity of your mind
and in this space begin to visualize that you are in the midst of an autumn
forest surrounded by trees with leaves turning amber
mahogany gold and crimson
the forest floor beneath your feet is a path of densely packed earth a thin layer of
early autumn leaves lays sparse signifying that the turn of seasons is
upon you
the air is cool but you are dressed warmly for the evening
the sky is still a pale blue but you can tell by the glimmer in the
trees that the sun will be setting soon
before making your way along the path that leads you through the woods
you take a moment to plant your feet into the earth
reaching the top of your head towards the sky above your heart opens your shoulders relax
you take a few long slow deep breaths to ground yourself
into this calm and soothing forest
you allow your forehead to soften your jaw to unclench
your belly to relax and all unnecessary tension to soften
and following your next breath out you decide to move forward
to venture deeper into the transitioning woods you have arrived in
step by step you move along the pathway that guides you through the colorful
enchanting landscape the air is crisp and earthy
cleansing you with each breath that moves through you
small forest critters scurry across the earth and and birds chirp from their cozy nests
snuggled in the trees as you admire the harmony of life here
in the woods you feel yourself surrendering to it
opening up to this moment exactly as it is
any weight you've been carrying upon your shoulders begins to lighten
guided by the energy of the falling leaves
any judgments frustrations concerns or worries that you've been harboring also find their place in the
forest dissolving from within your body as you harmonize with the environment around
you
the woods are at peace inviting you to find that tranquil space within yourself as
well though the forest is not immune to the
challenges of life but now it embraces the harmonious
transition from day into night
you carry on just a short while before the forest begins to thin
and as it does your jaw drops at the radiant beauty that emerges
glimmering back into your eyes a silent still pristine lake surrounded by the
vibrant foliage of the forest comes into view
treading lightly towards the water's edge you find a sandy stretch of shoreline
and allow yourself to take a seat
from where you rest you admire the reflection of the trees and the still
surface of the lake the perfect mirror image softens your
heart calling you deeper into the mystery of the world
the reflection reminds you that we are all mirrors to one another
that everything we face has something to show us about ourselves
or about the nature of the world
see if you can feel your mind softening as you reflect upon this
sinking into the silence that holds it all
and now as you sit here by the lake you hold yourself and the world
in a full embrace without desiring to change anything
about this simple moment see if you can open yourself completely to what
is
the frustrations the judgments anger that you've experienced as being a
part of the world now begin to feel distant
here amidst the autumn trees and silent lake you are granted with the time and space
required for you to process all of those inner energies
you trust that as you process them new possibilities for more wise and
loving steps to take in days to come will present themselves to you
as you gaze out across the water you realize there is nothing that needs
to be done in this moment but to continue allowing yourself to surrender
and so you lean back allowing your full body to nestle into
the sandy shore beneath you
feel yourself fully supported here on this small beach by the lake
as the sun seeps behind the tree line
the orange pink glow of the night radiates throughout the cosmos
bringing a warmth to your being
and as you rest here you take a moment to inquire with your body
about any areas of tension or residual anger that may be longing for your
attention drawing your awareness to the crown of your head to begin
you slowly scan the body downwards consciously relaxing or inviting a
loving breath into each area you pass
when you're finished tending to the entire body come back to your breath filling
yourself with cleansing crisp air of the surrounding woods that hold you
your inner eye is still open to the night sky you watch as the colors deepen
soon transitioning into a dark and deep purple
the crescent moon appears as do thousands upon thousands of shimmering stars
with your entire body relaxed breathe mindfully through the heart
space inviting the universal energy of love
to fill you on your next breath in
and offering your inner love back to the universe on your next breath out
and as you gaze up to the night sky take a moment to offer a few silent
loving words to yourself grant yourself permission to feel as you
feel while bathing yourself in words of love and patience
and care and kindness
[Music]
now i invite you to repeat the same for someone or something that may have stirred anger within you
in recent days and note that this doesn't mean that you
need to make right the actions of another it is simply an invitation to
where possible send love and care and patience to that which sparks
anger within us
when you are finished come back to your breath
noting how it causes your body to rise and fall as you rest in the silence of this night
let all thoughts and all images within the mind dissolve now there is nothing else that
needs to be done
slowly your eyes begin to close to the cosmos above you and the lake before you
your mind's eye becomes clear and you feel your body once again
tethered to the physical reality you rest in
you take three long slow deep breaths releasing with the sigh as you exhale
and when you are finished with those three breaths just allow your breath to return to its
natural rhythm
and as you move deeper into the night you let yourself go completely
getting the past and releasing the future
all that matters now is this present moment as well as the energies of love and care
curiosity and tenderness and so you allow yourself to be
here to be bathed in these soothing energies
as you drift into the restful slumber that awaits
