hello my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation
that will help you to fall asleep quickly and effortlessly
after a brief journey through the body we will take a trip into the cosmos
during which you will fall asleep swiftly held beneath the soft glow of the moon
and the stars allow the words of this meditation to
flow effortlessly through you there is nothing you need to hold on to
allow yourself to surrender into slumber at any point during this practice
[Music] now to begin ensure that all end-of-day
activities are taken care of your blind should be drawn any required
alarms should be set
and all lights turned off or shut out so that your body knows it's time to
rest deeply
eyes closed take a moment to land in the space that holds you
making any necessary adjustments to your posture for extra comfort
let your neck form one straight line with your spine as all muscles soften into the bed
or other surface beneath you [Music]
turn your attention towards the breath as you spend a few moments grounding through this force of life
that gently ebbs and flows through your body
as you watch your breath know that there is nothing it needs to do in no
particular way it needs to flow our breath contains a wisdom that knows
just how to support and nourish us all that is required is that we
slowly step out of its way by easing the mind and relaxing the body
as we move through this practice know that you can come back to the breath
any time you need to anchor yourself back into the present moment
the breath your physical body and these words all serve that purpose
each invite you to come back down into the sweet simplicity of this night
now let's take a moment to travel through the body softening each part that our awareness
moves through begin now by drawing your attention to
the crown of your head holding your awareness there for a few
moments [Music]
imagine this uppermost part of your body softening and a process that trickles down slowly
to ease your forehead
your eyebrows
and your temples
let your entire top half of your head relax releasing all physical and mental
tension it might be holding
and then slowly let this softening seep into your cheekbones and your jaw
your mouth and your tongue
as your awareness gently descends further it brings softness to your neck and your
shoulders helping them to release any weight they may have carried throughout the day
and then envision that softening trickling down your arms relaxing each and every cell
all the way to your fingertips
returning your attention to your heart space now allow your chest to relax and your upper
back as well
and then slowly scan the length of your spine downwards inviting all tissues and muscles that
surround it to surrender deeper into this night
[Music]
your attention centers itself in the belly now and let all muscles around your core
relax as the belly rises and falls with each
breath
and then allow your awareness to soften the hips the pelvis and the buttocks
before gently trickling down the legs softening each muscle completely until arriving at
the tips of your toes
[Music]
hold your entire body in your awareness letting it surrender completely into the
surface beneath you
you might notice a heaviness within your body as well as a lightness the sense that
your body has given up completely to the weight of gravity while at the
same time feeling entirely free and weightless
let yourself revel in that sensation for a few breaths now
the feeling of being held by gravity while also freely floating within the
airy cosmic universe
[Music]
[Music]
in just a moment we will begin a journey into the stars
floating gracefully away from the earth yet before we do so
let's take a moment to realize where we are truly headed and that is into a deep and restorative
slumber so before we begin our ascension into the cosmos
take a moment to silently repeat i let go
let go
i let go
surrendering completely to the weightlessness of [Music]
sleep
in your mind's eye as your body and mind become lighter i invite you to envision
that you are resting in an open meadow beneath the starry sky
a soft blanket of grass rests beneath you your body is kept warm amidst the summer
air
the breeze whistles in the leaves of nearby trees rustling through tall grasses as well
the night sky is onyx black reflecting darkness into your eyes but
for the dazzling stars and crescent moon above you [Music]
the world is quiet around and within you
you inhale the evening air filling yourself up with the airy cosmos
you are a part of
each breath in brings a lightness to your body [Music]
and each breath out helps you to let go to surrender to the sky above
and around you
as your body gets lighter you notice the earth beneath you drifting away
suddenly you are light enough to be untouched by the weight of gravity your
body rising above the ground and into the night sky
you are not afraid you know you are protected here so
surrender to the process you are in allowing yourself to be carried away
from the earth and into the stars
[Music]
your body floats higher and higher passing through thin veils of cloud
that grace the atmosphere
the air around you is quiet as is your mind space
up here amidst the clouds and beneath the light of the moon
nothing of your life on earth seems to matter
all that matters is this miraculous open space you drift through
drifting further away from the earth you take a moment to look down upon it
the entire globe is in full view the atmosphere around it dark and
peaceful and twinkling lights shine back at you
as if mimicking the stars
no sounds of the earth can be heard from where you are no traffic
no wind no moving water
you are miles away now [Music]
your entire body floats higher still and as it does the stars become
larger and brighter [Music] your eyes land on one star in particular
and everything else seems to melt away
you spend some time with this star whispering your intentions for the
coming day and inviting it to support you in surrendering to the night
your breath is still soft nourishing you as you float high above the earth
you take one last moment to commune with your favorite star before letting your attention widen to
all the other celestial bodies that find their home within the sky
planets comets and shooting stars all come into view as you gaze into the
abyss of the cosmos still you know you are held
safe by the universe here you are calm peaceful
and entirely at ease [Music]
you consider all the constellations that are spread out before you
indeed they look different from this higher vantage point their patterns not so easily
observed this close up and yet you reflect upon some of your
favorites orion libra
capricorn and aquarius
now that you are here in the realm of all the constellations [Music]
you understand why ancient traditions and cultures have long held up these celestial
formations the closer you get to them the more
remarkable they come the more they enchant your mind heart
and soul
come back to your breath with full awareness now inhaling and exhaling deeply
your body remains light and free as you drift through the cosmos
reveling at the stars
now like a feather gliding through the air slowly and steadily
you feel your body slowly coming back down
some magic mysterious force holds you supporting you as you move
gracefully away from the realm of planets stars and the moon
you do not return to the earth just yet though with grace you land gently
upon a plush supportive cloud
you release a deep sigh as you sink into this cosmic cushion letting it support you
from head to toe
as you rest here you find stillness [Music]
you gaze up at the mystery of the atmosphere above you eyes landing on the silver of the moon
that is transitioning through its waning face
in a few nights from now it will become a dark and dazzling new moon
and yet for now it is waning
slowly growing smaller at a rate too slow for the human eye to catch in a
single moment you consider the energy of the waning
moon remembering that this particular lunar transition
is a time for releasing slowing down surrendering and
restoring now is the time to sink into non-doing
to let yourself be exactly as you are
perched on a cloud you take three full breaths each inhale
lasting to a count of four and each exhale being a little bit longer
lasting to a count of six inhaling for
four and exhaling for six
[Music] you finish one more breath this way
allowing your exhale to cleanse you of any residual tension or weight you may be
unconsciously holding
allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm
your body is relaxed your mind is relaxed
and you are ready to completely surrender
you take one more moment to gaze up at the night sky from this height
you thank it for all that it has illuminated within you
and then slowly you drift like a feather once again
inching your way closer towards the solid earth
as you make your final approach held through this transition by a gentle and mysterious
force you count down from ten to let go more completely
ten your mind is quiet held in the silence of the night
nine your body is relaxed fully trusting of the universe that
supports it
eight your heart is open awake to the mystery and beauty
of the world
seven your shoulders surrender the weight of the world having been
freed from them
six your jaw is relaxed knowing there is nothing that needs to
be expressed
five your hands are free free of any desire to grasp attain
or achieve
4. your legs are relaxed knowing there is nowhere they need to
carry you
three your soul is at peace pleased with the journey it has just embarked on
two your eyes and eyebrows are softened knowing there is nothing
left to be seen
one your entire body is aligned feeling fully prepared to take the next
journey into slumber
zero your body grounds back down gently slowly coming into contact
with the earth once again
as the journey through the stars is now but a memory
take a moment to let all visuals disappear from your mind
as you come back to the felt experience of being held by the surface beneath you
from head to toe every part of your miraculous body surrenders your mental
and emotional body to sink into a soft and tranquil stillness
connected once again to the physical earth that supports you you revel in the sensation of being both
heavy and light simultaneously
feel gratitude for the force of gravity re-tethering you to the beautiful and
solid earth beneath you
and deep appreciation for the mysterious enchanted realm of the cosmos
for the lightness illumination and the magic it offers
just allow your breath to flow through you with ease once again
slowly allowing it to guide you into the final stage of surrender for the night
with each exhale you let go you let go
you let go
sleep well my friend sleep well
so
you
