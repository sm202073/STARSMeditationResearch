Sara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are an oasis where you can come
to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing
let's settle in for this evening meditation and relaxation practice
create a safe and tranquil environment for yourself and commit to your
meditation practice to experience the many benefits of a regular practice
I invite you to make yourself comfortable make sure your environment is all set
for you to drift off into sleep it is important for you to have the sense of
safety so that you can fully relax make
your room as dark as possible if you are
listening to this on an electronic device perhaps turn the screens light away from you create the most
comfortable environment that you can
take a moment to connect with your motivation for coming to your practice
[Music] without making any judgments or
attaching to expectations consider what
you want to manifest in your life take
just a moment to let it sink in
and let this be the first thing that comes to mind
no need to stay here too long let these
thoughts go for now and begin to settle into a relaxed
presence
now that you have prepared your surroundings and connected with your
motivations welcome a sense of relaxation and peace into your mind and
body [Music]
invite it in as if you are welcoming an old friend bring your attention to your
breath notice without making any changes
the rhythm of your breath [Music]
by simply being mindful and intentional of your breath
your body sends a signal to your brain that you are safe and you can allow the
relaxation response
now allowing this relaxation response to deepen begin to deepen your breath take
a full breath in fill up from your belly to your ribs and
all the way into your chest hold your breath for just a moment then let out
that breath gently allowing any physical
and emotional tension to leave your body with your exhale again take another deep
breath hold for a short moment and this
time take your time with the exhale slowing it down so that it lasts just a
little longer than the inhale
take the next few moments to mindfully breathe in this way encouraging each
exhale to be just a bit longer than the inhale to signal the body to relax
each breath cycle allow the exhale to
slow down a little more than the breath before it
and feel your body soften and your
thoughts slow down even more with each
slow deep breath
[Music]
become aware of your whole body in your environment
notice where your body makes contact with the surface beneath you and become
grounded
[Music] since the weight of your body making a
strong anchoring connection [Music]
let go into gravity to feel heavy into
your support
notice the fabric of your clothes as it
touches your skin or the area of exposed skin feeling the
brush of air
simply be aware of your experience in this moment
[Music]
[Music] and now scan your body for any areas of
tension and use your attention to
welcome a softening a sense of ease to
move throughout your entire body
as you observe your body soften and
release any areas you are able
invite the feeling of peace as you begin to tune out the world around you and go
within
allow my voice to be a soothing guide to
help you move towards manifesting as you sleep
in a moment I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the
top of your head going all the way through your body to
your feet as I say each part of your
body you can see that part in your mind's eye with your attention and
intention relax each body part completely
[Music] welcome the sense of ease throughout
your entire body and mind [Music]
encourage the weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface
below you
so that there is no need to hold on you can simply let go into sleep
now as you begin to scan your body bring
your attention to the top of your head
feel this area from the inside has sensations only
begin to relax the top of your head and your scalp
welcome this ease into your forehead and eyes release any facial expression
[Music] relax the small muscles around your eyes
and feel as your eyelids become heavy
allow your cheeks to soften unclench
your jaw
[Music] and bring some space between your upper
and lower teeth let your neck and throat
completely relax as each body part
relaxes in progression it invites in a
deeper sense of relaxation continuing to
relax invite a sense of peace and stillness to your shoulders chest and
arms perhaps feeling a comfortable
heaviness move into your ribs abdomen
and back [Music]
let go of any gripping in your hips and allow your thighs to rest heavy on the
surface below you as if there is no difference between where you end and the
surface begins you may find that the
simple act of paying attention to a body part allows it to relax and let go
[Music] since your ankles and feet relaxing
completely take another moment to slowly scan your
body once more this time notice any areas that may
still be holding on to any lingering tension and ask your body to let go
simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of
the surface below you your body is safe
and supported and knows what to do to relax if you simply allow the tension to
release
[Music]
when your body is relaxed there is space for dreams and possibilities to arise
you can more easily connect with your authentic self and your true desires
[Music] as you continue to relax I will guide
you through a manifesting visualization
this practice is not about perfection or about reaching completion this is the
planting of seeds and shifting of mindset towards the belief that you
deserve that which you desire this is
about experiencing faith while things
may not feel aligned with the life of your dreams just yet that's okay
[Music] simply work with what you have and begin
to move towards what you want you can't
change the past so be careful not to dwell there or attach expectations based
on the past
as you imagine the outcome of your manifestation you may see vivid pictures
in your mind or you may find emotions arising within you you may have specific
answers to some questions or they may come later connect with everything that
is coming up for you today and open your awareness to the possibilities as they
arise in the future
now remaining relaxed and grounded begin
to think about what it is that you want [Music]
see it in vivid detail if possible as if
you are watching a movie or perhaps here
what you want in your head as if it is a
story being told
imagine this as if it is true for you right now
feel it in your body as truth
experience as much detail as is available to you right now
[Music]
what feelings and emotions would you have more of in your life in this vision
what are the values and beliefs that are important to you that will allow you to
manifest your desires
[Music]
visualize both the outcome and the process to get there if it is clear
without getting attached to either [Music]
[Music]
these feelings from your visualization are already within you you can choose to
call upon the feelings anytime
you can create any life you want your
dreams are within your grasp when you choose to reach
connect with what is showing up for you now breathe it in
remain connected with the positive excited state of this visualization stay
connected with the building energy of possibilities for the future and at the
same time become aware of what you want and why you may not believe that you can
have it be mindful of this inner
conflict where part of you may be thinking you cannot have what you want you don't deserve it or that it is
impossible do not fight these thoughts
away accept them
don't stay here too long without judgment let go of your past beliefs
that could be holding you back
perhaps visualize letting go of a leaf into a moving River see your limiting
beliefs go
now that you have let go of that which no longer serves you you have made room
for the flow of energy for manifesting
letting go of resistance gives way to an attitude of allowing allow in positive
energy thoughts and beliefs allow in
gratitude love and abundance feel this
flow of energy within you and it is magnetically attracted back to you
[Music] take a moment to sense this energy and
positive feeling
now consider and accept all the positive reasons why you do deserve what you want
why you will get it and what you will experience when you manifest your
desires stay here a bit longer see
possibilities within you and everywhere you look
[Music]
it is important to acknowledge both the good and the bad although you will make
sure you have accepted all the positives and the negatives let go of the
negatives and focus on the positives here for a moment think of this as
watering the flowers rather than the weeds we can manifest what we focus on
what we believe in and what we have faith can happen
in a moment I will guide your subconscious with some positive
statements inviting the flow of abundance into your life there is no
need to repeat these if you are so relaxed you are almost sleeping your
subconscious will hear them simply believe they are true I see the world as
a positive and friendly place where good things happen I acknowledge the positive
in my life [Music]
I expressed the feeling of gratitude often for the blessings in my life
I love myself and believe I am worthy of that which I desire I allow the flow of
abundance in all aspects of my life
I radiate positive loving energy and that is what comes back to me
I take action towards my goals every day
[Music] I let go of negative energy that does
not serve me I know that the
possibilities are unlimited and available to me I let go of the
obstacles between myself and that which I desire I know abundance and success
are within me [Music]
I see myself as a person of success and abundance
[Music] I am strongly connected to what is
important to me
I am patient on this journey of change and growth
