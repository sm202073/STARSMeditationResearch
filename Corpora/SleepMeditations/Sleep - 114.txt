i'm sarah raymond from the mindful movement tonight i will guide you into relaxation
so you are ready to enjoy deep healing sleep all through the night take
a moment to create a tranquil and safe environment for sleep to easily come to you
when you are ready
i invite you to make yourself comfortable for the start of this practice
lie down on your back if you are able feel free to place a pillow under your
knees to keep your back comfortable [Music]
very gently tilt your chin downward
and as you do this sense the back of your neck subtly lengthening
allow yourself to begin to relax
now with your eyes open keep your head still and move your eyes
only as far as you can to your right [Music]
although it may be dark continue to keep your eyes to your right
as you breathe in and out deeply
it may feel right to allow a sigh exhale
[Music] take two more breaths allowing yourself
to let go into relaxation
after taking three breaths bring your eyes back to center
and blink a few times
and now still with your eyes open keep your head still and move your eyes
only as far to your left as you can
just like you did on the other side continue to keep your eyes to your left as you
breathe in and out deeply
again sigh it out if you like [Music]
take a total of three breaths here [Music] allowing yourself to think deeper
and deeper into a relaxed awareness of yourself
bring your eyes back to center and again blink a few times
[Music] one more position now with your eyes
open roll your eyes up as if you were trying to look into your own eyebrows
continue to look up as you take a deep breath in and out
again breathe in [Music] and out letting go
letting go letting go
on your next breath out this time give in to the heaviness of your eyelids
and allow your eyes to gently close
down as your eyelids close you may sense
the muscles in and around your eyes
become heavy and relaxed
this is a sign to the rest of your body to let go of tension
and to move towards sleep
now just forget all about your eyes [Music] and bring your awareness to your hands
notice the energy and any sensations here
with your next inhale make fists clench your hands strongly
then as you exhale release your grip in your hands and throughout your entire
body do this one more time clench your fists
tightly as you breathe in and let go completely
as you breathe out
allow yourself to release the gripping not only in your hands but
also throughout your whole being
continue to make yourself comfortable adjust your posture for maximum comfort
if needed knowing you are safe and fully supported
as you continue to allow a relaxed state to wash over your entire body
become aware of your natural breath
notice the aspect of your breath that draws your attention first
as you become aware here count your breath in
without making any changes simply allow it to be what it is
notice the count of your breath out just
as it is [Music]
accept your natural breath count and support it with your awareness
anytime your mind wanders throughout this practice
come back to your breath to refocus
if the count changes allow this accept this
invite ease into your breath
your body and your mind
like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow
with every breath allow yourself the opportunity
to relax into stillness
at your own pace
there is no rush as you begin to make space for your practice
there is no right or wrong as you allow yourself time
to settle your body into stillness
know you are in the right place
invite sleep to easily come to you
let go of any resistance or worry to experience deep blissfully tranquil
sleep
as you allow the counting of your breath to drift away
move your awareness to the sensations on the surface layer of your body
[Music]
perhaps notice where fabric touches your skin
or the air brushes against you
[Music] maybe you notice where one part of your
body rests against another
what are the sensations
do you sense a specific temperature
it is not about what you find when you look the benefits of this practice
of awareness are offered because you are pausing and looking within
fully experience these sensations even if you are only noticing one
small space
as you continue to notice the surface feelings encourage a sense of softening
or ease to spread through your body
[Music]
begin to notice the sensations inside your body now
as you quiet your thoughts you begin to hear the sensations
when you slow down and stay with the sensations
you notice more [Music]
you may even learn something new about yourself
[Music] take interest in yourself
as you are with curiosity
if you are able to allow life just as it is
it can lessen suffering
as you notice the sensations inside your body do you feel a buzzing or
tingling energy
do you sense the heaviness of your bones
sinking into the surface supporting you
once you are aware of your reality you may ask yourself
what would it feel like for you to invite ease to move from the surface of your body
to deep within
[Music]
listen with intrigue whatever arises during meditation
is your teacher it is your reminder to be present
and practice acceptance
you can either encounter resistance or experience bliss
by letting go and accepting your present state you
are moving towards bliss
look for what wants to be seen [Music]
listen to what wants to be heard
open to your experience of life with acceptance
you may ask yourself what must i accept or release
resistance to in order to experience a calm mind
allow the answer to come without forcing it
let the resistance dissolve away through acceptance
scan through the sensations of your body with a relaxed awareness
free of judgment
surrender any tension you may notice
soften any area you may experience gripping
allow this surrender to happen naturally throughout your body by simply
offering your awareness
soften from the surface all the way to deep within you
release any guarding you may be holding on to
surrender to anything you are holding on to for fear of losing
let go of what could have been
let go of any worry
let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders
let any tension dissolve from your muscles
every day we get a new chance to be in this moment
surrender to the ability of your body to heal
all emotional healing starts with self-love and forgiveness
and emotional healing gives way to physical healing
what else can you release or let go of to invite
the healing process
is it resentment shame or blame
is it guilt or disappointment towards yourself
whatever you are holding on to let it go
love your body love your emotions
love your thoughts love yourself
express compassion and healing towards yourself
can you find any areas where you are holding on and then let go
perhaps you may be holding at the area of your stomach
can you let go here
continue to connect with relaxation as deeply as you can
practice surrender practice letting go
open to the healing energy within [Music]
are you able to relax even more connect even deeper to yourself
listen to your heart surrender to your inner wisdom
your healing intuition [Music]
let go of your body further and further into relaxation
now as you continue to relax and allow a deep healing sleep
to come to you whenever you are ready [Music]
let your imagination conjure your personal healing place
this is a sanctuary in your mind where you can safely experience
profound healing this may be a place you have been to
before one that exists only in your imagination
or simply an idea of healing in your mind
you can sense this special healing place is just for you
and it has everything you need for your healing journey
because your mind is calm you can easily begin to connect
with the dreamlike state of mind
you may be inspired by vivid images appearing in your mind
ideas or feelings that are all about healing
in this healing sanctuary you can easily connect with your inner
resources with your spiritual resources
[Music]
as your healing place begins to take shape in your mind
yourself relaxing here
notice any sounds or smells that are part of your healing sanctuary
[Music] here it feels like home and you
sense that you can return to it in your mind anytime you need healing
being here in your healing place is an opportunity for you to connect with the
deepest part of you where the wisdom of your body
knows exactly what you need to heal
yourself perhaps if it feels right
you may also imagine there is a healing being here in your sanctuary with you
someone who loves you and would help you heal
or a professional healer or even a healing energy that would help
and support you
whatever healer comes to mind is just right for you
as your mind knows exactly what you need to heal
[Music] allow this healing support to move into
your body mind and heart
to heal you just where you need it in just the right way
[Music]
sleep now easily comes to you and welcomes a miraculous
process of repair and rejuvenation
during this deep sleep your innate bodily wisdom heals
everything that needs healing
here you embody love and compassion
you are open to the healing energy surrounding you and
supporting you tonight as you sleep and
long after this recording is over
my voice goes with you to support your healing journey
[Music]
as you sleep you receive the loving energy flowing into
and around you [Music]
the healing energy the light and love are flowing through
you at an even deeper level
allow yourself to be guided by the wisdom of your body
now this healing inner wisdom is moving through your body to take you
to an even deeper level of peace
this healing will continue to support you throughout the night as you sleep
you have calmed your mind and your body
you have cultivated a healing energy for a deep peaceful and healing night's
sleep you are safe your mind and body
are relaxed
sleep is inviting you to let go
allow this to happen if you wish
as you drift into deep dreaming sleep you will continue to
experience a peaceful and calm mind and body
body knows exactly what to do and what you need to heal
while you sleep
as sleep easily comes to you my voice will gradually disappear
when you wake hours later your body and mind will continue
to experience this powerful healing energy
may you experience a peaceful night's sleep
may you be safe may you be happy
may you be healthy may you live with ease
