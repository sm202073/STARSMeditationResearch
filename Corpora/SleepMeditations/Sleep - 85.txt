hello there my name is jason stevenson and welcome to tonight's guided meditation
to help calm the mind and release anxious thoughts
in tonight's meditation i'll provide you with guidance to witness anxious thought streams
to surrender to them and to return to your inner peace whoever you
are no matter what you are experiencing you are welcome here
we will move through this process slowly and gently and you'll be given plenty of time to
shift and soften any anxiety that is present for you
during this practice you are encouraged to drift off to sleep
whenever slumber comes naturally for you
so we will begin by taking a few moments to settle in through breath
and body awareness and then i will guide you to a comfortable place
in the middle of a tranquil forest an environment that will further help
you to let go
and so before we begin take a moment to find a comfortable
laying down position that will be supportive of deep sleep when the time comes
just allow your spine to lengthen and your limbs to soften
as you feel into how gravity is holding you here right now
closing your eyes whenever you feel ready
and take a moment to check in with your physical body
just inquire with your body about whether you might need anything else in this moment perhaps a
pillow a blanket a pair of socks or any other
adjustment
and when you're ready find a comfortable position of relative stillness you don't need to aim
for complete stillness as your body is always in subtle motion anyways
but see if you can surrender as much as you can into non-doing
knowing that you are always free to make adjustments as you need to throughout the practice
and turn your attention towards the breath for a few moments now just minding its natural rhythm
as it moves through your body
and for the next few breath cycles refrain from changing the breath in any
way simply allow it to flow naturally
while also considering the fact that each full breath cleanses and nourishes and supports you
each breath in restores your blood of the oxygen it requires
and each breath out emits what no longer serve you
and now i invite you to take three deep breaths at your own pace beginning whenever you are
ready and inhaling to the furthest depth that is still
comfortable for you and then exhale maybe releasing a soft
sigh or anything else that yearns to be let go of
inhale completely
and exhale what you no longer need
after your third deep breath just continue to breathe naturally
and then take a moment to re-ground into the surface supporting you
and just take note of each part of your body that is in contact with your bed
and noting the sensation of fabric against your skin
and before we move into the forest inside your mind just take a moment to offer a word of
gratitude for the place that holds you right now
make a note of any aspects of your environment that you can be thankful for in this very moment
and when you're finished turn towards the creative center within your own mind
and through your mind i invite you to travel consciously now finding yourself
in a brilliant forest held beneath the warm late summer sun
you were standing on a narrow footpath of aromatic amber soil
and on either side of you majestic trees stretch up towards the beaming
cosmos the wind is warm as it brushes
just gently against your cheeks
standing here in the wilderness of these woods your shoulders begin to soften and drop
this forest sanctuary comes to you as a refuge away from the weight of the world from all that you felt you
needed to carry in the days up until now
for these precious moments i invite you to grant yourself permission
to let go to simply tune into what is right here
and to open up to the possibility of deep release and
inner peace
as you grant yourself this permission you know that you don't need to force
yourself to feel any different than you do right now
and furthermore know that opening up to inner peace
does not mean that all of your outer world challenges will disappear
however consider that there is a chance of finding respite beneath the
waves of the worried mind
know only that this peace and tranquility is possible opening your heart to the journey that
guide you there
now take a moment to feel into your body here in the forest as you witness yourself
acclimatizing to your new environment perhaps you might see yourself stretch
your arms up towards the sky or reaching down to the earth in
reverence witness yourself moving in any way
that helps to free up and release stagnant or anxious energy within your body
eventually you returned to standing gazing down the trail stretched out
before you the path ahead is whimsical weaving
in and out of the old growth forest you take a long deep breath
inhaling the forest air
and as you exhale you begin on your way taking the trail mindful step
by step
as you go you absorb the beauty of the forest around you
hummingbirds flitter through the air and squirrels and chipmunks jump from
treetop to treetop
ancient ferns rise up from the earth in their cosmic patterns and countless
other species of plants and animals make themselves known to you in fact
the diversity is beyond anything you've ever seen
take a moment to explore the environment for yourself as you walk through it allow it to come
to life with any plants animals or even insects
that bring you a sense of peace and
well-being
consider the fact that your inner forest is completely unique to your own mind and imagination
and bring it to life in any way that soothes you
in other words plant your inner refuge as you please
as you witness the peace that lives in this forest notice how a sense of ease grows inside
of you notice your belly softening
your limbs relaxing and your worried or controlling mind
letting go even further breath
by breath by breath
simply just being in this forest provides you with something you it helps you to naturally
and effortlessly begin the process of letting go
now soften your gaze on the plants and animals of this forest
as you focus once again on the trail ahead of you
as you do you notice that this pathway ends just a few meters up ahead
and where it does there is a small clearing in the woods
you make your way towards the clearing which enchants your heart and mind
completely it's surrounded by tall ancient trees
with wild flowers lining the perimeter teal violet and fuchsia petals are in
full bloom
the soil in the clearing is bare but it's still rich and full of
invisible energy and in the center of it a tiny nest of
sorts has been laid out for you
a persian rug is spread across the solid earth and on top of it plush cushions and
blankets are scattered this human-like nest in the middle of
the forest has your name on it and so you make yourself cozy within it
as you come to rest your back on the soft rug in the middle of the forest
wriggling your body to get comfortable you take a few deep breaths to settle in
and softening your belly as you breathe
with each breath in you embrace the vitality of the forest around you
and with each outward breath you feel yourself melting a little bit further into the
earth
each breath brings you back to what is right here back to the peace that is possible when
you connect with what is present
you continue to breathe naturally as you gaze out at the world from the surface of the earth
those majestic trees stand even taller with canopies that dance through the
glistening sun the trees are alive you can feel
their energy and you embrace their shelter their
stability and their protection
now gazing up at the canopy you see that there is enough open space
for the sunlight to pour through as it does it blesses your entire body
not only does it offer you its warmth it offers ease and release as well
to further soothe the mind you tune in more closely to the physical
body as it rests beneath this glorious sun
you begin by drawing your attention towards your crown
feeling the golden light of this radiant star penetrating opening and softening the uppermost
part of you
this light begins to seep downwards relaxing all the muscles around your
eyes it disarms the flow of any repetitive
and unhelpful thought patterns
you exhale to release surrendering your mind to the cleansing
power of this light
and then you feel the sun's rays inch further down filling and relaxing your jaw
your tongue and your throat
you take a long deep breath into this golden light
feeling it ease any tension you've been carrying in and around this part of you
still resting on the forest floor you feel into the sun's light as it
enters your shoulders and then as it slowly seeps into your
upper arms your elbows and lower arms
and into your hands
as this metallic yellow light fills you from shoulders to fingertips
you feel your arms let go you feel them surrender
you know that there is nothing you need to latch onto nothing you need to fix to grasp
or to sort out you just grant your arms permission to
surrender
the light from your shoulders now enters into your upper torso
your lower back melts it surrenders
and your heart space opens up to the universal light that touches it
as you breathe life force moves into and out of your heart with complete ease
and then the golden light seeps even further downwards tracing the length of your spine
until it lands in the center of your belly
as you breathe here feel your belly filling with radiant
sunlight it dissolves all tension
all contraction and all worry
helping you to breathe a little deeper
at the same time your lower back begins to soften as well
coming into deeper and deeper peace here in the forest where you rest
you witness as the sun's glow enters your pelvic region now
and as it does your hips begin to unknot
tension begins to melt seeping into the earth beneath you for
renewal
and finally the golden light of the sun begins to inch its way down your legs
first it fills your upper legs relaxing all of these muscles completely
then it flows down to your knees into your calves and shins
and eventually into your feet into each and every toe
feel both of your legs surrendering with the support of the light shining down from above you
waves of calm pulse through your entire body
follow them for a moment now witnessing them as currents of golden
light ebbing and flowing from the top of your head
to your toes and then from your toes to the top of
your head and back again
as this golden wave of calm rises up to your crown it eases your
mind and connects you to everything around you
and as it ebbs back towards your feet it grounds you deep into the earth
providing you with a sense of strength and resilience
the sun's rays continue to hold you as you tune into other elements of the forest now
first you notice the sweet aroma that fills your nostrils as you breathe
you absorb the aliveness of the forest with each full breath
then your eyes trace the lengths of those remarkable trees
which are firmly rooted calm and stable
you admire the base of the trees and the intricate pattern of their bark
and then your gaze rises up them noticing the complexity of branches that
extend out from the solid stable core
the leaves on those upper branches are diverse and varied even from down below you can
see that some are round some are triangular and some
are irregular like the leaves of the chestnut trees and the maples
just together they dance seamlessly in the soft breeze
occasionally you witness a leaf splitting from its branch
and dancing down towards the earth you admire how effortlessly it lets go
how naturally it surrenders
as you gaze up at the leaves you realize how transient they are seasons come and seasons go
and throughout the seasons the trees shed their leaves in order to be renewed
and so you liken the leaves above you to the thoughts that come and go for seasons in your mind
anxious or worried thoughts are just as transient as those delicate leaves that shimmer in
the wind
and so as you rest here beneath the canopy pair
each falling leaf with an anxious ruminating or worried thought that you would like to release
or soften
as one of these thoughts come to mind see it falling towards the rich and
fertile earth as a delicate leaf does at the end of its season
as each leaf of anxiety or worry falls towards the earth something
remarkable happens time appears to speed up in your mind's
eye as you watch each fallen leaf transmute from vibrant green
to deep red to dark rust and quickly as if you were watching
time-lapsed film you observe each leaf decay becoming one with the
bed of soil it rests on
continue to watch this miraculous process of transformation on your own
link each anxious thought with a falling leaf and as it arrives on the earth watch as
alchemy takes over what begins as a worried delicate leaf
fluttering in the wind of life is capable of transforming
of becoming rich dense soil through the ever-present possibility of
transformation
remember that your body is a tool to facilitate release
with each thought that surrenders to the earth allow the body to surrender as well
by relaxing your body you encourage the mind to do the same
any and all sorts of anxious thoughts can be processed in this way
so long as the cause of your concern does not require urgent action in this moment
it's possible to tap into a sense of surrender
and to let go of anxious thoughts does not mean we don't care about
certain outcomes or that we are in denial of how we feel
rather it's a simple recognition that the past cannot be returned to
that the future is undetermined and that all we have is the present
moment and in this present moment we can choose to open ourselves up
to deeper peace
you continue to rest on the forest floor bundled up as the sun moves behind the
canopy now the air is still warm and so
you are completely comfortable
take a few more moments of silence to watch leaves of anxious thoughts fall
towards the earth watch them quickly and effortlessly
turn into dried leaves and then into soil itself
your eyes are growing tired but you continue to absorb the tranquility of
the world around you here amongst the plants
insects and trees you realize that anxiety is not a concern
the various beings that call this forest home simply go about their lives
they know what needs to be done and they do it
and the rest they leave
an awareness grows within you that nature doesn't need to worry
yes there are times when it must leap into action to protect itself
but it doesn't over ruminate it doesn't
overthink this recognition alone helps you to breathe deeper helps you to further surrender
you come back to your breathing feeling the natural rhythm of this cycle
moving through you just like the seasons the breath comes
and it goes it comes
and it goes
you feel yourself surrendering deeper to this universal wisdom of the breath
you realize that there is indeed an innate universal force that is holding you
and supporting you you realize now that you do not need to
do nor do you accomplish everything on your own
and so if you'd like to i invite you now
to ask the universal energy all around you for any support that you need for a
final release
in other words is there something that you are still struggling to let go of
something that you need support with
and if so turn towards the sky that seeps through the canopy overhead
and ask for its wisdom for its support
if you hear a wise voice offer its support to you
know that not only does it come from the universe around you
it comes simultaneously from inside your very own being
you are the holder of the wisdom that you seek
for a few more silent moments come back to the falling leaves
let any thoughts that do not serve you be surrendered now
allow the universe and your inherent wisdom to support you with this
if it feels natural for you you might even tap into a sense of joy as you observe
the falling leaves letting go doesn't always have to be
difficult often there is joy in release
now you can tell by the movement of shadows that the sun is beginning its final
departure the forest appears to be preparing for a
good night's rest animals have slowed their stirring
butterflies have retreated for the night and all that remains in their place is
near stillness
as the earth slows down so do you
the mind which had already experienced a sense of quiet tranquility
slows even further you are beginning to pass into the state
between wakefulness and sleep
but before you drift off completely you continue to take in the radiance of
the world around you namely the colors in this evening sky
first the sky illuminates with a soft clementine orange glow
it doesn't quite reach the uppermost cosmos but the horizon casts its light
through the surrounding trees this radiant orange light floats across
your body granting you warmth and balance and vitality
from head to toe you open yourself up to it completely
soon the orange light in the sky begins to transmute
electric magenta begins to shine through in its place
as it covers your body it grants you a sense of childlike wonder
magic and trust
open your heart to this enchanting pink glow
the light in the sky continues to shift soon the once pink glow
becomes a deep mesmerizing violet
a color associated with wisdom spiritual connection and the soothing of
emotions you feel yourself coming into complete
alignment as this violet light passes over you
all of your cells all of your muscles your nerve endings
and all of your organs are touched by this cleansing radiant light
it fills your entire body from the tips of your toes to the crown
of your head and as it fills your mind space
it dispels any last ruminating thought patterns that may have been
stubbornly holding on you don't need to bring them
with you into the slumber ahead
the dark violet color grows deeper soon becoming a midnight blue
you can still make out the night sky against the black silhouette of trees overhead
and through that empty space that exposes you to the cosmos
the milky way begins to appear the thick blanket of stars is
mesmerizing
you feel completely safe and supported here in the forest
somehow as the day has departed and the midnight hour creeps closer
you have gained an embodied sense of belonging you feel a part of this forest
a part of this entire earth and universe in fact
and it is this deep sense of belonging that awakens your inner peace
worried thoughts may still rise from time to time
but you've gained a new perspective of them ear gazing out at the milky way
you realize that in fact you are not looking out at the stars
you are a part of them and being a part of the universe like
this you are unconditionally supported through everything
you are unconditionally loved
sink into this deeper understanding of your belonging for a few long deep breaths
if you'd like to you might want to release a soft sigh with each exhalation
if any worries or anxious thoughts creep back know that you hold the power to release
and to soften them just refrain from judging these thoughts
or pushing them away simply acknowledge them as a part of yourself
that simply needs your love and compassion
grant them your love let them know how strong you are
and then allow these unhelpful thoughts just to fade away
through the canopy above you catch side of the moon making itself known
to the dark sky tonight it is a waning crescent moon
fading into darkness day by day by day
this waning moon offers a final reminder to surrender
it invites you to make space by cleansing the old
so that you may set new intentions and new belief systems to empower you in the days to come
so as you gaze up at the radiant silver of the moon take a moment to
consider what intention you'd like to set for the day that awaits you
what qualities or ways of being would you like to harness while you
sleep and carry into tomorrow
once you have your intention silently repeat it to the moon
three times
release your words of intention when you've finished your third repetition and sinking back
into the silent stillness of the evening forest
feel back into your breath observing once again it's continual
coming and going and as you breathe listen closely
see if you can hear the sound that it makes
if you can hear it liken this sound to the soft flow of wind through a tranquil forest
canopy like the one overhead of you now
you close your eyes and once again you can feel your body being penetrated with soothing
light energy this time it's not the sun it is the subtlety of
the moon and so eyes closed to the forest around
you you feel into the silver light of this moon
first it weaves its way into the crown and headspace
reminding you to let go again and again
and again as many times as is needed
it then ebbs its way into your cheeks your mouth and your throat
helping to release your jaw and anything you've been clenching onto there
you then feel the moon's glow moving into your shoulders
and as it does you release your shoulders into the earth
words of the indian scholar and environmental activist vandana shiva come to mind
you hear her whisper you are not atlas carrying the world on
your shoulders it is good to remember that the planet is carrying you
now the silver light seeps into the full lengths of your arms
just as the sun did all those moments ago
the silver light brings deep release to each of your muscles
from those in your shoulders all the way down to your fingers
let them go let each of those muscles surrender for
the night
you trace the silver light back up and into your chest now
where it creates a sense of spaciousness
your heart area illuminates with bright silver light and it grows with each
inhalation if any thoughts arise from now on
you can guide them into this luminescent heart for transformation
now the silver thread of light weaves its way along your spine
each vertebrae that it passes surrenders to the evening
and eventually your stomach fills with this subtle silver glow
and feel your breath as it moves into this space
the silver glow expanding in your belly with each full breath
and it softens all areas around your core
front and back side to side
this calming silver energy enters into your hips and pelvis
bringing softness to this part of you one last time before sleep
and then it weaves its way through your upper legs
past your knees into your lower legs
ending its journey at the tips of your toes
just allow both legs to relax in their
entirety take a few full breaths as you bathe in this silver light of the moon
and if you find that there's any specific part of you that longs for a little more silver light energy
draw your attention there let it fill to the brim with the light
of the moon
and when you are ready let the imagery of this silver light soften now
the moon is still there high up in the night sky
but you can shift your attention to any other anchor that feels soothing for you
perhaps you focus on the breath inhaling and exhaling the fresh
nourishing air perhaps you focus on what it feels like
to be held against the earth by gravity
what it feels like for each part of your body to fully surrender each muscle to fully
relax into the surface beneath you
perhaps you gaze up at the milky way at the tops of the trees
or at some other point in nature that soothes and settles you
just whatever brings you a sense of peace presence and well-being let that be your
anchor for a short while longer
and slowly now i invite you to release the imagery of the
forest from your mind as you gently shift your awareness
back to this physical reality
keep your mind soft you've not physically gone anywhere and
so you don't need to return you've always been here
you've always been held by this space the entire time
if you are still with me i trust that sleep will be coming soon for you
between now and then use whatever anchor you please to keep your attention
focused and your mind calm
the peace and tranquility you experienced here tonight was not a product of anything outside of
yourself it came from within
remember this deeper truth anytime the mind seems to wander off on its own
remember that you hold the power in all moments in all breaths
to bring yourself back to peace the seeds of your inner forest refuge
are always there always available to be tuned into
good night my friend good night
you
