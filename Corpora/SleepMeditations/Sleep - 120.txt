today's deep sleep meditation to help you fall asleep fast
is about cultivating space for a new realm of healing to take place
for your health to thrive you need a coordinated effort of many moving parts
just like an orchestra coordinating on stage to create a perfect harmony
today i will guide you to build the metaphorical stage
open the curtains and harmonize with the healing powers of the universe
this healing will take place as you drift to a deep uninterrupted sleep through the night
tonight fill your mind with profoundly healing thoughts and positive
affirmations to encourage amazing health and vitality
let go of the identity of illness and identify as a self-healer
hello and welcome to the mindful movement i'm sarah raymond and i'm honored to take you on a journey of
self-healing i invite you to make yourself
comfortable as you begin to settle
towards finding stillness notice how it feels to unwind a bit
allow any tension in your body to release into the support
beneath you
take a few deep slow breaths
as a signal to your body mind
and nervous system that you are safe
and it is time to rest and slow down
as your body continues to relax further
your mind will get the signal to let go of the busyness
of the day [Music]
allow the thoughts of the day to slow down
and disappear
you might imagine this like a high-pitched fast
violin solo transforming into a slow
[Music] melodic wave of a cello
continue to rest in stillness
you may even notice a sensation of calm
begin to swell enveloping your body
as it continues to let go even further into comfort
the sounds of your body grow slower
and slower with each breath
allowing your body to think even deeper
this patient process invites
the cadence of your heartbeat
to gradually ease
with this slowing down of the day
your body can begin to feel heavy
and harmonious within the space it lies
[Music] as your physical body
continues to relax and let go deeper
towards sleep [Music]
in your mind imagine an orchestra
there are so many contributing parts
in an
orchestra each part needs to come together
in a coordinated effort and when they do
[Music] a beautiful harmonious sound
emerges
your body works similarly to an orchestra
as there is a vast spectrum of moving parts
and a variety of processes
going on at the same time
when the various parts of your body come together in harmony
the sound of your very existence
can take shape in physical form
and the song of your soul can be played
at times the song can be dark or chaotic
and other times it can be peaceful
and in harmony [Music]
tonight i invite you to compose a new song
a healing and harmonious song
of your soul
imagine a blank slate
as you begin to compose this healing song
of your soul
how would a harmonious vibration show up
in your body [Music]
[Music] what would the sound look like
what would your harmony feel like in your body
as your many frequencies rise how does your body
begin to shift
how does it change your melodic expression
how does this shift in frequency change your physical experience
[Music]
imagine every system in your body as its own instrument
in the orchestra your nervous system
digestive system
your immune system and
cardiovascular system
your skeletal system and respiratory system
your muscular system
your lymphatic system and your endocrine system
[Music] every system in your body
is getting tuned by your intention
[Music]
every system is preparing to re-integrate
with a common purpose
all of your systems are connecting with
an intention of healing
relax with this harmony of your personal orchestra for a moment
feel [Music] know and trust
that all of your systems are creating a perfect
connected harmony [Music]
[Music]
the stage has been built now there is a fresh space
for a healthy you [Music] to emerge
through the curtains
[Music] visualize yourself now
because this is a version of yourself that exists in your imagination for now
see yourself vibrantly healthy and healed
feel these emotions of a healthy version of yourself
[Music] visualize your highest self
radiating in light
vibrant with universal energy
as the stage curtains of your mind open
you stand strong in your light
[Music] your soul
is singing into existence [Music]
a new you [Laughter]
you feel embraced with warmth and light
you can sense your frequency is shifting
you are playing a new song
you are playing the harmony of a healing song
as these sensations permeate your body
give them time now to settle in
welcome this new song into your body
relax into this feeling
[Music] go a little deeper into the positive
feeling of this harmonic frequency
[Music]
begin to connect with the space closest to you now [Music]
notice the near edges
notice the edge where your body
and environment meet
allow yourself to harmonize with this space
surrounding you
this is a two-way street
[Music] watch as your environment
harmonizes with you
[Music] the universe is shifting to
the universe is resonating with your new song
[Music] as you sleep tonight
these intentions you are setting
will begin to facilitate your growth
and your healing
new healthy cells are being built
in every moment
and tonight they will move with a purpose
a purpose that you have directed as you are the conductor
of the beautiful harmony of your inner orchestra
[Music] slowly scan over your body now
allowing your awareness to move through the beautiful aspects
of your physical being [Music]
observe how your arms and legs feel
let your arms and legs go now
as you allow any residual tension to
release away
[Music] notice your torso
your back your chest
and belly as you let yourself
go deeper into relaxation
your exhale can now bring your body into a deep
state of rest
[Music] allow the muscles of your face
and neck to let go now
soften your forehead
release your jaw [Music]
let the little muscles around your eyes
soften
your whole body is beginning
to melt into the space beneath you
realize that you are the director of this beautiful
peaceful state
you have created this space of calm
all of your cells are listening
they can hear your signal
all the moving parts are harmonizing now
you have made space you have set the intention
[Music] and your new healing song
[Music] of your soul
harmonizing with the universe will be playing through you
tonight
embrace this song with an open heart
you are healing now
know in your heart you are healing
you are healing now
you have the power to heal yourself
and you are healing
sleep well tonight
you can drift off now
[Music] you can let go
[Music] know in your heart
you are healing
you can let go now
surrender to the universe
say yes to healing
you are healing now
you are healing now
know in your heart you are healing
you are healing now
you have the power to heal yourself
and you are healing
sleep well tonight
you can drift off now
you can let go
know in your heart you are healing
[Music]
you can let go now
surrender to the universe
say yes to healing
you are healing now
