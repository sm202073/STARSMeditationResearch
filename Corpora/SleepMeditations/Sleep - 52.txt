hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this calm down for sleep
guided meditation journey possibly
you've come here because your mind is overworked you're feeling stressed
whatever the case you've arrived at the right place and this meditation is for you so without further ado let's relax
the mind and firstly I want to drop the word and I want you to drop the word
meditation there is so much associated with meditation what it is meant to do
and what we must achieve from meditation so let's drop everything associated with
achieving anything and let's just simply call this a before sleep journey so
right now we want to let go of all expectations and set out to achieve
nothing just to simply be
if we can just be we are on the path to peace of mind accepting all that is in
this given moment so getting comfortable now wriggling around if necessary arms
by your side feet relaxed and just let your feet part naturally as they choose
to begin by closing your eyes and gently taking three deep breaths in through
your nose and out through your mouth and on the breath in sending that breath all
the way down to your lower belly area and feeling this area expand and as you
breathe out feeling it deflate like a balloon that's releasing air
[Music]
and once you've done this returning your breath to a natural and comfortable rhythm breathing in and out through your
nose [Music]
now during this journey we're about to embark on together thoughts are going to
come and go in fact you're going to go off on tangents into your own world and
at times not even realizing that you've drifted off and away from this sleep
journey this is perfectly okay so when
you become aware of this just welcome your awareness back saying to yourself
ah Here I am again back on my journey so no matter how many times you have to do
this it's perfectly okay and normal to have thoughts coming and going so right
now just become aware of your body the weight of it the feeling of your head on
the pillow or the mattress
and feel yourself as you begin to get heavier as though you are sinking
through the mattress
with each breath feel this heaviness sweep across your body from your core
Center out to the extremes of your body your toes your fingers the top of your
head feel this getting heavier and
heavier
[Music]
if you sense any worries or concerns at this moment you can let them go now you
are safe in this moment right where you belong in perfect timing
[Music]
as you feel yourself sinking I would like you to visualize that you are
sinking through to a soft Bank of white fluffy clouds now you may see these
white clouds you may feel them or just simply sense that they are there
surrounding you comforting you
[Music]
you may have had a busy day today with a hectic schedule but right now give
yourself permission to let this go even if only for the next few minutes allow
any stress and tension in your body to melt away to dissolve
and the clouds are here to help you as they wrap you within their softness
protecting you nurturing you
[Music]
[Music] within this time and space you have the
opportunity to let go of your worries and fears and take some time to simply
be
[Music] so embrace this chance to be without
thinking and instead focus your mind on the warmth and drowsiness it's filling
your limbs
allow yourself to move softly and intuitively through this journey
allowing the physical sensations around you to be your focus instead of thoughts
or worries
if you find thoughts surface blow them out on your next breath let them go
[Music] breathing deeply
[Music] you are continuing to drift downwards
sinking through the clouds softly safely moving closer and closer
to a glowing white light shining brightly comforting you
as you get closer to it you feel your shoulders effortlessly release the
stress they bear you notice the way your
cheeks smooth out any frown lines
vanishing as you move nearer to this light your tongue falls away from the
roof of your mouth the backs of your knees dissolve into relaxation as the
muscles in your body finally let go of tension you've carried with you today
every bit of tension with every breath you are melt into this peaceful
landscape allow yourself to sink relax
[Music] you become so relaxed with little effort
as a feather fluttering from the sky to the soft ground below
[Music]
deal your body become heavier and heavier as your mind softens and your
breathing slows down finally reaching a deep and restful place
[Music]
as you were drawn close to the glowing white light you allow yourself to be
absorbed into the gentle warmth that emits when the warmth enters your body
flowing through your veins and even easing any aches and pains you may be
experiencing you drift deeper into this
velvety bed of fluffy white clouds feel
the softness of the clouds around you
the clouds are warm and comforting delicately reaching out to embrace you
your head drifts into the airy whiteness surrounding you closely followed by your
torso and your outstretched arms and legs
your whole body is supported by the ethereal yet unquestionable sturdy
fibers of a thousand clouds as you are
welcomed by this velvety softness allow your mind to focus on your whole body
absorbing the gentle touch of the clouds as you sink deeper and deeper into
relaxation and peace
[Music]
[Music]
the deeper and deeper you drift the more distinctly you feel delicate cool
tendrils brush against your skin as they
wipe away wrinkles on your forehead
these wisps are so soft and tense muscles and leave you feeling rested and
drowsy
allow yourself to continue to sink deep into the clouds and accompanying
relaxation drift on this gentle plateau
of clouds for a moment savoring the absence of thoughts around you and the
sensations that come with it be all the
soft heat of the Sun on your face now and your eyelids as they drift shut
continue to breathe deeply inhaling the gentle sunlight and exhaling any stress
or tension from your day
just enjoy these next few moments floating effortlessly on your own in
your save space
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
focusing on your breath brings you to an even deeper sense of calm and relaxation
in fact as you breathe deeper and deeper
closer to the bottom of your lungs you begin to notice any lingering thoughts
and worries as brightly colored balloons surrounding your pillowy resting place
these concerns take shape as you watch them moving through the same sky as you
the thoughts above you drift back and forth attached to you with thin almost
invisible strings
although these thought balloons are fascinating to watch move across the sky
above you they hold you aloft when all
you want to do is to continue to sink further into the welcoming bed of clouds
around you so take a moment to look at
these thoughts above you enjoying their colors say thank you for their presence
with you today as you examine and thank your thoughts
imagine now cutting all the thin threads binding them to you
[Music] watch these thought balloons drift
upwards their strings dancing as they rise into the air above you watch them
until the small colourful shapes disappear from view [Music]
[Music]
know that these buoyant thoughts are gone leaving you free to sink further
and further into the soft whiteness around you just breathe deeply now and
notice how your body feels
if you notice thoughts or concerns appearing in your mind's eye simply
thank them for all their work today and cut them loose watching them float away
far from view this place is for noticing
the sensations in your body and savoring the relaxation that comes with it allow
yourself to take a deep breath and enjoy it all allow yourself to keep drifting
downwards
feel the way the clouds touch brushes pain or aches from your neck notice how
it erases the tightness in your back allowing your whole spinal cord to
lengthen and soften your legs become
heavy and still armed by the presence of the clouds around you savour the warmth
in your feet and the relaxation in your eyes your whole body becomes heavier
softened by your gentle descent through the clouds [Music]
your progress is slow and effortless a safe and peaceful journey deeper and
deeper
give yourself time to simply be here in this space if your mind begins to wander
bring it gently back to the soothing sensations of your sleepy limbs breathe
deeply enjoying the way the air you inhale inflates your lungs and on your breath
out sighing out any tension that's remaining
you are totally relaxed comfortable and at peace in this moment
allow yourself to feel your body as it is tugged slowly downwards through the
soft fluffiness of the clouds around you
give your muscles permission to soften to relax and let yourself breathe deeply
sighing out any aches or pain you are at

slowly into deeper and deeper relaxation
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]

leaving your entire body and mind soft and relaxed savor the heaviness in your
arms and legs
and allow yourself to appreciate the slow drowsy feelings that meander
through your body on your next inhale

your back releasing your face softening
and your shoulders drooping
[Music]
