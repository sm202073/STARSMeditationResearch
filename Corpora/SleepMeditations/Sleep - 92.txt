hello and welcome to the mindful movement I'm Sarah Raymond thank you for
joining me this evening for this guided sleep meditation I welcome you on this
journey to help you heal while you sleep
this meditation will begin by assisting you to relax and prepare for the night
ahead once relaxed there will be a series of affirmations that you will hear until
you are asleep you can simply listen to the affirmations or if you would like in
your mind feel free to repeat them this is designed to help you drift off to
sleep while the affirmations are continuing you do not need to be awake
to benefit from them your subconscious will hear them as your
own words our thoughts and the words we
shape them with can influence our body's ability to heal our bodies cells are in
constant communication with each other and collectively they hear what we are
thinking and saying and therefore having
positive thoughts and using positive words can create a healing environment
for ourselves ultimately it is always
our body that does the healing we only need to provide the right environment
the answer is always within us
take a moment to make sure you are in a comfortable position that you can drift
off to sleep
relax enjoy and let the healing begin as
you settle into comfort for the night scan your body and make any adjustments
you feel you need to sleep peacefully
for the entire night so that you can wake refreshed find a
position where your spine is straight and your legs are uncrossed
look for anywhere you can let go of tension and soften into the surface
beneath you [Music]
let your eyes close gently relaxing the small muscles around your eyes and
forehead [Music]
allow your awareness to rest now on your breath [Music]
notice your breath as it is right now
quietly observe this for a few moments
since we're your breath travels inside your body
and any subtle movements that come with each breath cycle
now on your inhale feel the life force of the entire universe in your breath
allow your breath to slowly deepen and feel this connection
[Music] this is an ever-present connection you
have with every breath [Music]
this breath right now can link you to the universal life force
and this life force flows through you [Music]
with every breath it flows through every cell of your body
[Music] as you exhale breathe out relaxation
[Music] let this lifeforce flow through you like
a wave in through the inhale and out or
the exhale relaxing you more and more
let go of any tension from the day
let go of your arms and legs
let go of your hips [Music]
let go of your chest and back
and let go of your shoulders and neck
and now let go of all of the muscles in your face your jaw your cheeks and
forehead
let go of tomorrow's to-do list
let go of the stories of the past
be here with your breath and this body
surrender into the surface below you [Music]
you are here [Music] safe and relaxed
[Music] you are ready to heal your sacred body

deep within your soul deep within your subconscious
