the chakras and your higher self guided meditation hello and welcome to this
guided meditation my name is Jason Stevenson and thank you for taking the
time to join me and trusting in my work
this meditation will consist of a body relaxation to begin with followed by the
spoken chakra and communing with your higher self too often we get so caught
up in our lives that we forget to really live and really living means existing
beyond the confines and demands of schedules immediate wants and needs the
expectations of others and the need to conform
I wonder if you can remember what it was like as a child what it was like to just
be to live and to be joyful without a
question to live free of doubt and self-criticism
it's all about being in the moment enjoying it free of expectations and
just being alive William Blake put it best when he wrote
to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in
the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour it's
and so beautiful but I guess we think but how can you hold infinity in the
palm of your hand and eternity in an hour is it even possible
yes it is true.you exists in all things and all
things exist within you when you truly understand that you experience the
entire universe within yourself and yourself as the entire universe once you
experience that then you grasp that heaven already dwells within you as does
infinity within that heaven lies all possibility
and all joy and with that infinite space lies infinite wisdom and infinite power
all begins with breath the bridge between your smaller self and your
higher self let's begin just finding a comfortable
place either seated or lying down making sure there are no distractions for the
next 30 minutes or so and just breathing
in and out now through your nose and seeing if you can slow your breath down
to a count of three so breathing in on a count of three through your nose and
releasing that breath on a count of three so it's inhaling one two three exhale
one two three and just see if you can
keep a steady rhythm similar to this but that's comfortable for you the remainder
of this meditation we'll begin with a body scan now just
becoming aware of your body and starting at the top of your head noticing any
sensations here the density and the
space this area takes up
and including in that awareness as your phorid I'm aware of this area
[Music] without judgment just being aware and
feeling any sensations that may arise [Music]
and taking in and awareness of your eyes your ears your nose and cheeks
[Music] your mouth and lips or teeth the entire
face
sensing any sensations even sensing
where the air meets your skin
and becoming aware moment by moment if
any sensations or feelings that you feel come and go and during this time if your
mind wanders that's simply okay just allow it to be your only role is to
simply acknowledge your thought if it wanders and then come back to focusing
on the parts of your body my voice and
sensations that you feel [Music]
so we're going to shift that focus now from the top of your head and your face
moving it down to the neck your shoulders you might even feel your
shoulders relaxed a little this is a place where we store a lot of tension
our shoulders and our shoulder blades
also being aware of your neck and your throat area
[Music]
you're sensing what is going on here
[Music] you might even be able to feel air
coming and going in the throat area
moving down now to focus on your arms
elbows [Music]
and your forearms [Music]
and down to your wrists and your hands
[Music] your hands may be either resting on your
lap or at your side
right down to your fingertips
[Music]
see if you can sense the weight of your hands and each individual finger
[Music] and any sensations that you may feel
just being aware moment by moment
[Music]
and shifting your awareness now up to your chest area
you may sense the rise and fall of your chest the subtle rise and fall
[Music] and bringing your awareness to your
ribcage the front the sides of your
ribcage and ride around your upper back its
resting either against the chair or on the mattress of your bed
if you sense any tension or aches or pains just bring a gentle awareness to
this
not forcing any pain or aches away but rather just simply being aware
[Music]
moving that awareness down now to the abdomen area your stomach
feeling sensations here you may feel it
softening releasing
and just the chest you may feel your
belly rising and falling as the air comes and goes
whatever you feel whatever you sense just be open and aware and accept
[Music] and shifting that awareness now to the
lower back area [Music]
you may send some pressure here [Music]
and continue to shift your focus to the pelvis area your buttocks
being aware the space that this takes up
the air against your skin
any sensations that you may feel allow
them to come and go with full acceptance
[Music]
continue now to bring your awareness to your thighs the top of your thighs
besides inner thighs and underneath you
may feel the pressure of where you're laying or seated
sensing the weight of your legs
if your mind begins to wander at all that's okay just simply bring it back now to
focusing on your thighs
and moving now down to focusing on your knees the top bony part of your knee and
the inner fleshy part underneath
in full awareness just accepting
anything that comes and goes any sensations feelings thoughts with full
acceptance
[Music]
you may become aware of some discomfort or pain that is okay to just be with
this [Music]
moving your attention now to your calf muscles of both legs
if you were lying down in bed you may feel the calf muscles spread against
your bed [Music]
and shifting around your shins
and finally bringing your attention to both of your feet the soles of your feet
any pressure that's attending here the
breach of both feet
ankles and right down to your toes each single
toe you may even sense the space between
each toe [Music]
[Music]
just checking in on your breathing now
and feeling this breath sustaining you
breathing in and out throughout your entire body
[Music]
and seeing if you can take in now the awareness of your entire body from your
feet all the way up to the top of your head
[Music] accepting all that is
without judgment just being aware
[Music] just stay with this for a few moments
and allow yourself to relax further
[Music]
I'd like you to bring your focus now to the base of your spine
[Music]
and Eli's your first chakra the part of
you that says I am
see if you can bring your breath here and give thanks for your sense of being
inhale into this chakra and as you exhale mentally say to
yourself I am
just stay with this for a few more breaths
[Music]
[Music]
I'd like you to now bring your attention to the spot just below your belly button
this is your second chakra the part of yourself that says by desire and see if
you can breathe into this point and give thanks for your existence as you exhale
mentally say to yourself by desire and
just stay with this for a few breaths
[Music] now if you'd bring your attention to
your belly button this is your third chakra area which gives you the urge to
act just bring your in-breath here and as
you exhale mentally say to yourself I act and keep this breath going here for
a few moments
focusing now on your solar plexus and this is located just beneath the
midpoint of your chest and this is your fourth chakra the part of you that feels
take your in-breath here and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I feel
and again just staying here for a few breaths
now bring your attention to the base of your throat and here lies your fifth
chakra the part of you that expresses bring your in-breath here and as you
exhale mentally say to yourself and make myself known
and please keep this up for the span of a few breaths
now bringing your focus to the space between your brows this is where your
sixth chakra is the part of you the comprehends breathe into this spot and
as you exhale mentally say to yourself I understand and stay here for a few
moments
[Music] now with your eyes still closed see if
you can raise your eyes and try to look at the roof of your head don't strain
yourself just if you feel discomfort or pain just lower your gaze until you find
a position you're comfortable with here
at the top of your head lie as your seventh chakra the part of you that
understands things free of prejudice discrimination feeling and attachment so
bring your in-breath E and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I know and
we'll stay here for a few moments
shifting your awareness now to pay attention to your entire length of your spine visualize it as a white pillar of
light whose bottom starts at the base of your spine
rising up through your body
up past your neck rises through the middle of your head and right to the top
of your head
if it helps you can imagine that your entire body is a pole made of pure white
light one end of that light rises up
through the middle topmost part of your head stretching many miles above you
with your eyes raised as high as you can comfortably lift try to see where that
light goes as it rises up past the roof of your head
although that beam of light goes off into eternity there is a sort of barrier
that lies some 12 inches above your head this is the eighth chakra also called
the great sound from your perspective it might look like
an umbrella or as if you were sitting beneath a great transparent jellyfish
loading some 12 inches above your head
it's also called the witness the part of you that's attached to your body but
isn't in your body [Music] this witness is the midway point between
your physical self and your higher self which has never been born and can never
die you might like to think of it as a boy
bobbing on the water's surface beneath that boy is a string attached to the
oceans floor the beam of light that starts at the base of your spine and
shoots out through the top of your head
between the boy on the water's surface and the anchor that keeps it bound to
the oceans for liars and not and that knot is the witness connecting your
physical body your highest self which never lives and never dies
[Music] rising up that beam of light that point
some 12 inches above your head is a light body it's a detached version of
you one that knows your likes and dislikes your passions and urges it
doesn't judge you simply observes and record your thoughts and your feelings
without thinking or feeling them [Music]
as the witness you sent your body below
feel it breathing gently beneath you [Music]
as you witness you feel and see the line of light
stretching forth above you toward infinity
there is an ebb and flow of impressions and sensations that your lower self
transmits to you in flashes remember
there you sit a float in a timeless sense of being you
are light made of light and encased in light
emitting light
from that perspective you see but do not judge the actions of your lower self
you see it scrambled back and forth like a toddler just learning to walk like a
child it makes mistakes as it was born to do but how else can it learn
[Music] this is part and parcel of who and what it is that one that sits a liar's in
meditation is calling out to you but may feel lost alone adrift or in need of
guidance may feel disconnected confused
and grounded
it reaches for you as a toddler reaches out to its mother
just listening now it asks for guidance
reach out simply reach out and reminder that it is
loved it has always been loved and will
always be loved [Music]
with each in-breath that draws the memory of you deeper into itself
with each out breath it stretches forth and reaches out to you
here in this moment [Music] let the barriers of memory weaken so
that the body sitting below you can feel you again feel its gentle rhythmic
in-breath and out-breath expand and contract its wondrous body
drawing you in with each inhalation and reaching out to you with each exhalation
guide it that it may live in wisdom and power so that it may make the right
choices at the right time in the right place
and with the right people
guide it but it may live in dignity and grace making the right choices at the
right time at the right place
with the right people
guide it that it may live in peace and joy
[Music] guided that it may speak to you and hear you whenever the need arises always at
the right time at the right place and with the right people [Music]
through your guidance may had finally learn to see the world
in a grain of sand and heaven in everyone and everything
even itself [Music]
through your guidance made finally learn the power of seeing infinity in its own
existence and eternity in the joy of every breath and every passing moment
[Music]
[Music] bring your focus back to the top of your head be all that light of your own power
above you and know that it will always be there whenever you need its guidance
simply be still and breathe slowly
rhythmically [Music]
inhale now and as you exhale mentally say to
yourself I know [Music]
and again inhale
and on the exhale say I know [Music]
and stay with this for a few moments
return your focus to the spot between your eyebrows gently lower your eyes so
they gaze at the back of your foreign [Music]
inhale and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I understand
inhale exhale I understand
[Music]
still focused on your breathing keeping
your eyes closed and slowly return your breathing to normal
bringing your breath back to an easy comfortable rhythm
at this point you may return to waking life who you may continue to drift off into a
deeper purposeful sleep welcome home my friend
