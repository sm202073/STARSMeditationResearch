so just make sure that you cannot be disturbed switch off your mobile phones
and close your eyes and as you close
your eyes you feel every part of your body in contact with the chair or the
ground you can feel every fiber of your
body soften relax release

the sunlight all the darkness the warmth
of the room the softness of your clothing against your body if any
thought or tension from your day appears just smile at it and let it drift away

to and only the truly important matters will be waiting for you when you come
back this is your chance to let go of
your day to sink into a deep sense of relaxation and serenity and to explore
the hidden adventures of your own subconscious mind
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
as we move through this meditation continue to breathe deeply and notice
the sensations that come up in your body releasing thoughts and anxieties as they
come up enjoy the feeling of just being
here in this moment bring your minds are
into the room around you and as you picture your surroundings look closer at
the wall nearest you see the hazy outline of a door appear notice its
texture perhaps not at dark oak or a sleek blond wood
notice how it is becoming more real more concrete
[Music] now imagine standing up from your chair
or reclining position and walking towards that door reach out your hand
and touch it feeling it's cool solidity
now grasp its handle and give it a gentle tug opening it to reveal a
staircase leading upwards you cannot see
what's at the top of these stairs but you know deep inside that it will be
something calming and pleasant [Music]
take that first step up the stair feel
your feet against the stairs treads worn from so many years of use grasp the
handrail and continue climbing up the stairs each step you take relaxes your
body more and more causing you to breathe deeper and release any tension
that may be hiding in your muscles at this moment
[Music]
[Music] [Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
as you begin to get closer to the top of the staircase visualize the warm sunny
light emanating from the room beyond it
feel its gentle warmth against your face increasing as you get closer and closer
to the top of the stairs breathing deeper and relaxing more fully take two
more steps and you've reached the landing you're in a library of sorts
with tall ceilings and enormous glass windows outside of the glass you can see
fluffy white clouds moving across a cerulean sky watch them pass for a
moment slow and graceful wisps against a calm blue background feel the glow of
the sunlight against your eyelids
in front of you is a soft upholstered chair with a small table next to it walk
towards it noticing all the bookshelves you pass and the colorful intricately
embossed spines of the books that reside there know that they don't matter right
now as the book you need to read is already waiting for you resting on that
little side table just ahead when you
reach it sink into the chair feel its
softness how it supports your back your neck your shoulders right where they may
be aching exhale all this pain and
tension and inhale breathing in total
calm feel how easy it is to just dissolve
into this chair releasing any thoughts that you've been carrying with you until
now exhale deeply feeling entirely
peaceful in this quiet serene place once
you are ready pick up the book on the table next to you it is small bound in
royal blue leather its title is stamped on the front in gold leaf just above a
delicately embossed pattern of stars
look a little more closely at this title sensing these golden letters rearranging
themselves until you can read what they say this book is called relaxation run
your fingers across the cover feeling the pebbly texture of the leather and
the slight indentations of the embossed pattern know that when you open it you
will be taken someplace new someplace totally calm that you can
return to at any time you will be totally safe and will return
to the library feeling even more peaceful than you do right now with that
in mind open the book and see the printed words watch as they run together
and grow until all you can see is the texture of the paper and the text
getting larger and larger surrounding your body like a warm gentle bath watch
the characters dissolve slowly but surely until you can feel yourself
standing on a grassy hill you are surrounded by night sky and the white
pin pricks of stars
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
inhale smelling the sweet scent of night blooming flowers and growing grass feel
a soft breeze across your skin look upwards at the sky inky sky and the way
the stars resemble tiny pearls at the bottom of a dark ocean breathe in this
night air notice the way it swells into
your lungs totally absolving you of any tension in your body inhale deeper and enjoy the
sense the breeze carries to you listen
to the crickets chirping the occasional sleepy call of a now simply breathe it
all in and exhale any thoughts or worries that surface in this serene
landscape if you become distracted bring
yourself back to the details all around you the breezes gentle caress the trees
whispering in the wind the fresh scent of grass and soil when you turn around
you'll see the twinkling lights of a city somewhere in this city lies an
object that will help you attain total and complete relaxation do not worry
your senses will guide you right to it so in a moment
turn around and soak in the side of glimmering lights in the city below
notice how the lights mirror the stars like a reflection on a still lake a
glimmer in the night sky and the town's lamps below Sparkle creating a landscape
of almost unending light the whole
valley and sky is filled with gentle dancing brightness breathe it all in
letting your senses absorb the quiet twinkling of the stars the breeze
and the plants and animals around you feel how soft the soil beneath your feet
supports you letting you stand totally comfortably and view this scene savor
the way the breeze brushes around your skin washing away any cares and tensions
like water [Music]
[Music]
know that you can return to this hill to this very spot anytime you wish as you
observe the valley below you bring your attention to your feet planted on the
ground underneath them there is a pebbly
path just in front of you made from small white river stones it leads down
into the valley and fades into the distance somewhere beyond the city you
know that this path will take you exactly where you need to go and so as
you begin to walk down it you feel any tension melting away left behind on the
hilltop feel the way your feet press
against the cool smooth stones the way the pebbles give way like sand notice
the city lights getting closer as with each step you take tension dissolves and
you relax more completely keep walking
enjoying the sights and sensations surrounding you welcoming you to this
peaceful place
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now that you're close to the city you see that the Whitestone path
continues through it leading you through brightly lit streets and dimmer
alleyways it flows over any obstacles
that may be in your way keeping you totally safe and guiding you towards
your ultimate destination as you pass
houses and storefronts smile at the sounds of conversation and laughter
inside their walls but do not worry
about speaking to any of the inhabitants you may return another time and explore
the nooks and crannies of this city but now you are drawn almost magnetically to
what awaits you at the end of this path
if you encounter figures or thoughts from your day know that they accept this
and will happily await your return another day the white stone path
continues onwards through the city every
step pulls you closer and closer to its end where an item waits for you this
object will be uniquely personal something with significance to you but
do not worry about what it might be before you discover it know that
whatever this item is it will help you attain peace and relaxation in both your
meditation and waking life
so as you feel yourself pulled along this path release any ideas about what
this object might be or what it might mean breathe deeply inhaling the soft night
air and gentle lights of this quiet city
you are now leaving the city continuing out into the countryside beyond the
lights notice how much easier it is to
see the stars out here feel the way the soft grasses brush against your legs as
you continue on this pebbly path breathing deeply and releasing any cares
you may be still carrying you can see an
outline of something a little further ahead something at the end of this path
as you approach it you see that it is an old well and on it hang as a small lamp
flickering slightly in the gentle night breeze approach it feeling the way the
path pushes you towards it when you reach this well stand a moment and
notice the sturdy time-worn stone
although it has been here for many years everything is still in good repair when
you are ready grasp the wells handle and turn it lowering the metal pail that hangs on it
down into the ground there are a few
small bells tied to the rope notice how they tinkle merrily as the pail descends
happy to help you along your journey take a moment to enjoy the sounds of the
sleeping valley around you
[Music] continue turning the handle until you
hear the pails splash as if it's water once it does exhale releasing your
expectations along with your breath inhale turning the crank the opposite
way to bring the bucket back up to you
when the bucket reaches the top of the well there will be something inside it
for you something to help you remember this feeling of total calm so when you
are ready reach your hand in and pull out whatever lies inside it what is it
hold this item in your hands feel its weight its texture its temperature
notice how relaxed you feel totally devoid of any tension or anxiety in your
body slip this gift from the valley into
your pocket and carry it with you knowing that anytime you feel tense or
stressed you can touch it and be instantly transported back to this state
of calm
[Music]
[Music]
now reach your hand back into the bucket and feel your fingers curl around
something else something solid and rectangular withdraw it from the bucket
the blue and leather gold embossed pattern glint in the moonlight this is
the magic book you read before ready to take you back to the library when you
are ready take a moment to look around you notice
the Stars and the glimmering lights of this city savor the sounds of the wind
and the nocturnal animals the way the cool white pebbles press against your
feet smile at everything you encounter when
you are ready open the magic book and begin to read watch the words on each
page grow small and smaller multiplying until they fill your vision
when you can no longer see the valley or the light they dissolve and you find
yourself sitting back in the South upholstered chair all ivory
[Music]
feel the weight of the object you found in your pocket and know that you can
always carry it with you set the book in your hands on the table beside you and
take a moment to reorient yourself within the library when you are ready
stand up and look around know that the blue leather book will be resolved
waiting for your return in precisely the right spot bid the library farewell walk
toward the flight of stairs when you
reach the stairs grasp the handrail and begin your descent each step you take
brings you closer and closer to where you began your meditation closer and
closer to full consciousness
[Music] continue walking noticing how although
you were getting closer to the bottom of the stairs your sensations of relaxation
and serenity only increase when you
reach the door at the bottom open it and step out into the room where you were
before approach the chair you are sitting in and sit down enjoying the
tranquility your time in the valley has brought you smile at the thought of all
the other adventures that awaits you ready for exploration any time you feel
like returning to the library
return your consciousness to your physical body begin to wiggle your fingers and toes
waking up the parts of you that rested while you were meditating when you are
ready open your eyes breathe and smile
