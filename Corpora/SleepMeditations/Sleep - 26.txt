the area between your eyebrows just above your nose this is sometimes called
the third eye area and no straining here just seeing if you can see visualize
this space you may see nothing it could
appear as all black you may see shadows or flickers of color white purple or
black
[Music] whatever you see here is all normal
there is no right or wrong just be with
this [Music]
now as you stare into this space it begins to open up and you begin to see
the expanse of the beautiful night sky
you're now outdoors it's a warm balmy
night you are safe laying in a peaceful field on a rug you
feel comforted and supported by the beauty of the Bible black night sky
[Music] you've never seen the stars shining so
brightly each one of the trillions of
stars above you presents their own magic to you comforting you keeping you safe
offering their presence and reminding you that you too are part of this
enormous expanse you have never been separate always connected and at one
[Music] the stars have been waiting for this moment to connect with you and for you
to connect to them
as you pee up into the night sky it's almost as if the stars are reaching down
to you Olly Olly wanting to be closer to
you leaving trails of white sparkly streaks as they do so whispering to you
the beauty you see above you is the beauty you have within they continue to
slowly fall towards you almost like some scene from an imaginary fairy tale it's
almost as if you could reach out right now and you could touch them these stars
are puncturing the night sky with their brilliant light and there are trillions
of them galaxy after galaxy
some of the stars are so close to you and yet others are beyond the beyond the
depth of these shining beings of light is incomprehensible as you witness this
in awe and wonder just allow your eyes
to wander across the entirety of this expanse
you can see some shooting stars across the patches of darkness like a memory
they are there one moment and gone the next reminding you again of the fleeting
moments of life all of life is transient
nothing stays the same and this too is
okay
you see that some of the stars are dim whilst others are shining brightly
[Music]
breathing in and out deeply releasing and surrendering all to the night sky
allow your eyes to come to rest where they may no straining no effort just
where they fall and be here in this
moment you feel comfortable so
comfortable in fact that you can begin to release all of your boundaries
letting them go it's a release
a huge release to be able to let go of control and surrender to the beauty that
is contained within this universal night sky
[Music]
[Music]
your boundaries begin to break down so much so that you begin to become one
with the night sky there are no borders

an eagle experiencing what it is like to feel completely free at peace and beyond
all worry once you have unbound yourself from all
worry and have tasted this sense of freedom you are naturally and gently be
led into a nourishing and peaceful sleep so take a few deep breaths now as you
open your heart to this nourishing and rejuvenating nighttime visualization
before sinking deeply into this meditation ensure that all end of day
activities are taken care of allow both body and mind to open up to a state of
deep relaxation by coming into a supportive lying down position you may
use cushions or blankets to comfort you in any way
ensure that the neck is in line with the spine promoting a subtle openness of the chest
and heart [Music]
relax all muscles of the face softening
the eyes and eyebrows the forward and
the jaw
take a few more breaths here to really ground yourself into this still and
quiet state of being
[Music]
[Music] the light begins to dim having cleansed
your body and mind entirely this dimming invites you into a deeper and peaceful
sleep allowing you to rest completely throughout another night
you feel yourself sinking further and further into the surface beneath you
everything within you that does not support your sense of relaxation has
been released there is nothing else for
you to do nothing else to be envisioned or thought of
you are entirely at peace as the steady rhythm of your breath rocks you closer
and closer towards a deep and nourishing
sleep
[Music] draw your awareness now to your physical
body but to no point in particular simply make note of whatever you notice
as you are called to draw your attention to your human form without judging or
assessing whatever you come across simply observe if there is any sense of
heaviness constriction or judgment and invite your breath to these areas allow
your breath to nourish and release any sensations of tension that may be
currently present within you [Music]
remember that all feelings and sensations are passing they come and go
like gusts of wind or like waves simply
providing an opportunity to take a deeper look inside
[Music]
[Music] continue witnessing and breathing into
any discomfort that might be present until all that is left is a sense of
lightness
if there are stubborn areas that feel constricted somehow that is okay do not
worry yourself with being anything other than what you are simply open your heart
to the possibility of infusing this experience with a sense of
weightlessness
if you need to you can mindfully adjust the body in any way to provide yourself
with more comfort move gently and slowly
promoting the relaxation and effortlessness that we are cultivating
if your mind wanders at any point during this visualization know that this is
entirely okay if you come to notice at
any point that your attention has been consumed by thoughts or worries of the
past or future simply acknowledge the thought wave compassionately before
releasing it back to the open space that it came from in this moment there is
nothing view to figure out in the mind nothing for you to anticipate or fear
simply draw your attention back to the breath as the mind wanders knowing that
you are entirely supported by my voice the music and the universe it is safe
for you to slowly and gently let go
come back now to your breath and again draw your awareness to your stomach as
your attention shifts to this deeper area of the chest cavity your breath
will naturally follow along take three
full breaths here and with each one notice your entire body becoming more
expansive notice your mind and body getting lighter and lighter
allow the mind to sink further and further into the heart until nothing
remains but a vast openness as clear as pale blue sky
[Music] now begin to imagine that you were looking
up at this expansive blue sky from a beautiful open field you are resting in
the center of it comfortably with cushions and blankets observing the
freedom inherent in this natural landscape wildflowers grow abundantly
throughout the sea of green that surrounds you
[Music] above you is a nearly cloudless sky and
a warm Sun that invites you to breathe a little bit deeper and you do breathing
in the pure air of the world around you
you are feeling completely at ease within this landscape your breath flows smoothly and deeply as
you allow the physical world to support you here [Music]
overhead something begins to appear out of the distance as it makes its way
closer to the air space directly above you you come to see that it is an eagle
soaring freely across the clear blue sky
take a few moments to observe the smooth curves it makes as it wings and carves
its way through the air it is both strong and light moving with both
confidence and grace
the Eagle continues to dance through the sky as it makes its way closer and
closer to the earth it appears to be
approaching the very field you rest in but nothing about its approach frightens
you in some strange way you feel that
this bird is no different from you and you know deep in your gut that in no way
can it harm you in fact the eagle brings you a sense of
inner peace courage and lightness you've
heard much about Eagles knowing that their presence is an invitation to move
deeper into freedom soaring high above
the sky Eagles suggests to us that now might be the time to look at things from a new
perspective these birds grant confidence and courage
to look ahead they symbolize new beginnings self
growth and personal awareness as you
observed the Eagles flight you are blessed with its wisdom feeling
refreshed and renewed [Music]
you witness the eagle landing on the soft earth beside you as you rise to
your feet to welcome its arrival the two
of you meet eyes and then bow your heads in respect of one another with the great
eagle just before you you stretch your arm out to touch its soft code noticing
how calm and relaxed it is within this environment and in your presence the
eagle is free unbounded by fear and anxiety as it welcomes your tender touch
it reminds you that you too have nothing to fear
breathing deeply soaking in this sense of freedom and on your next exhale you
release all residual tension that lingers in body and mind you are
complete at peace with this great bird knowing that in fact you are one and the
same
[Music]
[Music]
the Eagle takes one last look at you and turns preparing to take off once again
preparing to set sail in the clear vast blue sky as the great bird turns its
head you realize that by some divine magic you have become this eagle gazing
up towards the open sky you realize that it is you who is preparing to take off
to release everything that tethers you to the physical world to soar high above
the earth free and unbounded the Eagle
came for just a moment to show you that her way is your way that nothing stands
in your way of experiencing what it feels like to be entirely free and
suddenly in the midst of this realization you lift off from the
security of the earth to experience a complete lightness in your being
you saw ever lessly above the planet extending your arms with the same
strength and grace shown to you by the Eagle that had once been with you now it
is you now you are the eagle entirely
free and unbounded by any and all earthly concerns within this incredible
open stretch of clear sky you set
yourself free you are entirely at peace with this present moment
[Music]
[Music]
as you witness yourself floating effortlessly through this open air you
feel nothing and everything no worries no fears and no attachments and yet you
feel harmonious with everything around you you are in a state
[Music] eat of deep peace as you allow yourself
to surrender completely to the lightness of the universe around you
[Music]
take a few more full breaths here deeply into the belly as you allow yourself to
revel in this moment there is nowhere else you need to be but right here grant
yourself this time to be full be at
peace and fully supported by the universe around you you are fully
supported here unconditionally
[Music]
[Music]
slowly you begin to feel yourself coming back down to earth with the energy of
the Eagle ingrained deep into your cells you know that you carry this energy of
freedom wherever you go whether high above the earth or nestled into the
comfort of your own bed with each exhale
you sink a little bit further back down to earth back down to the surface that
supports you in this very moment you
settle now back into the earth gently releasing all visualizations of
the Eagle the sky and the abundant field you once rested in even though you have
returned to this physical space you still carry the wisdom of the eagle deep
inside yourselves the feeling of being entirely free lingers within you
come back once again to the breath bringing your attention now to the heart
inside this space in your chest you may envision a warm white light beginning to
appear with each breath it grows expanding softly and swiftly to
touch each cell of your body soon
your entire body is bathed in this warm white glow as you feel yourself letting
go of this day completely as you feel yourself inching closer and closer
towards sleep
[Music]
the light begins to dim having cleansed your body and mind entirely this dimming
invites you into a deeper and peaceful sleep allowing you to rest completely
throughout another night you feel
yourself sinking further and further into the surface beneath you everything
within you that does not support your sense of relaxation has been released
there is nothing else for you to do nothing else to be envisioned or thought
of you are entirely at peace as the steady
rhythm of your breath rocks you closer and closer towards a deep and nourishing
sleep
[Music] welcome to this guided meditation that
will help you to find peace and inner tranquility before you naturally fall
into a deep and restorative sleep over
the next short while you'll be guided to relax the body and ease the mind before
being led through a visual journey into a mystical cave of peace it's your time
to allow yourself to be carried away gently through this journey knowing that
you are entirely supported in this present moment so take a moment now to
ensure that all end of day activities have been wrapped up alarms should be
set and liens drawn you
I invite you now to come into a comfortable lying down position ensuring
that your body is resting with ease wherever you are you might want to use
blankets or cushions to support you as you find comfort in the physical space
you occupy take a few releasing breaths
here allowing a deep sigh to leave your body on your next outward breath
[Music]
to begin our journey into tranquility take a moment to observe that the
stillness of your physical body [Music]
as day transforms into night and the Sun fades away we are invited to enter a
much needed period of rest and rejuvenation as we sink into the
stillness of night rest assured there is nothing we need to consciously engage in
or take care of we can trust that the body will work by its way of its innate
wisdom so take a moment now to quietly
observe the miracle of this body
feel into its heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you
you might want to notice now where there might still be movement despite the
sense of stillness notice where breath brings subtle
movement to the body how it causes the chest and stomach to expand on each
inhalation and to fall away on each
exhalation [Music]
observe how beautifully this gentle movement intertwines with a deeper sense
of complete stillness as you take a few deep breaths here in silence
[Music]
[Music]
if thoughts arise in the mind no that is entirely natural for them to do so as
you become aware that your attention has shifted into stories about the past or future simply acknowledge these thoughts
from a more distant place than is habitual
[Music]
while the mind can be useful at times it can lure us into an unproductive thought
cycles when left to run on its own terms
as we begin to witness our mental movements from a higher or broader
vantage point we practice our power of discernment easing challenging thoughts
and emotions as we experience greater clarity and a sense of peace
as you journey through this meditation keep this sense of distance in mind as
thought arises and return to your breath as an anchor when needed
[Music]
[Music]
move now further into breath awareness as you practice holding your attention
on this anchor that is always available to you
[Music] notice the breaths rhythm its pace and
its depth as you move alongside it in both directions hold for a brief pause
just a second or two and at the end of each inhalation and each exhalation
finding brief moments of complete stillness within each breath cycle
[Music]
you
[Music] allow the mind to gently subside as you
become more attuned to the present moment attachment to worried anxious or
distracting thoughts can be released as you practice being the observer of
whatever is moving through you just
allow yourself to sink further and further into this very moment
entering naturally into a state of full-bodied ease and tranquility
[Music]
with your eyes remaining closed tuned into the space between the
eyebrows just in front of your mind's eye envision in this space of vast
emptiness something like a clear night sky
sink into this infinite abyss of space and silence for a few moments as you
prepare to enter into a cave of complete peace and tranquility
as you gaze with eyes closed into the empty sky in front of you envision your
view dotted with infinite sparkling stars you are in an open outdoor space
surrounded by the open air lakes rivers and mountains the moon is high and full
[Music] tune into your breath for a few moments
noticing the freshness of the air that fills you [Music]
just follow my voice for a few breaths here as you inhale deeply breathing in a
sense of being completely at ease and exhale slowly releasing any tension or
stress in body or mind inhaling again
visualizing yourself filling up with peace and ease and exhale fully
releasing anything that no longer serves your movement towards complete
relaxation
breathing deeply once more filling yourself with the freedom and freshness
of outdoor air and exhale completely
releasing all tension to be transformed by the starlit sky
returned gently to your natural breath allowing your mind to refocus on the
empty space in front of your mind's eye
though night has fallen upon this outdoor landscape the land is lit by
stars and moonlight granting you with
enough light to see the curves of the earth take a moment now to simply
observe the way the rocky mountain faced peaks and Falls and the way rivers and
lakes gently caress the hard surface of the earth
notice how peaceful it is here beneath the night sky as you feel yourself
coming into complete harmony with the natural world
[Music] from where you stand you see an empty cavern not too far away illuminated by
the full moon above its spaciousness its
emptiness cause you towards it so you
begin to walk slowly and mindfully towards the sheltered space within the
mountain notice the way your feet
effortlessly move across the earth you
feel completely at home in this natural landscape as you move towards the cave
that beckons you quietly
as you reach the opening to this wondrous cave your original sense that
it rests unoccupied is confirmed there
is no one here but you know plant life inside and no animals the only thing
that you have yet to sense within this cave is a deep stillness it is
completely silent and yet something about it is calling to you in the
faintest whisper recognizable only by your heart
by the entrance of the cave there is a candle placed here by some universal
force for whoever might come to rest here you light the candle with a match
that has also been provided and quietly make your way inside the dark cavern
fear anxiety and worry are completely absent all that is present within you is
a growing calmness
he reached the center of this mystical cave that has called you into it
setting your candle in the center and bringing yourself to rest comfortably on
the floor lying on your back you stare
up at the ceiling noticing the incredible edges carved by nature
breathing deeply and feel entirely at peace in this open and empty space
[Music]
silence surrounds you as the mind rests in a deep state of peace and tranquility
your breath continues to flow through you effortlessly
and gracefully [Music]
yet within this vast silence something in this cave is speaking to you the mind
cannot decipher it but the heart knows that there is a great wisdom radiating
out from these walls you listen more intently to this language still foreign
to the mind and find that your heart begins to open up the serenity of this
space softens your heart as a deep trust infiltrates your entire being in this
serene state you find a calm and the quiet sense of courage to ask this cave
any questions that might arise from your purest heart
as you allow your heart to ask these wise walls any questions that arise you
find that the questions themselves are infused with trust rather than with fear
and anxiety your heart speaks calmly and quietly the mind resting peacefully in
the background and as you listen closely
with your heart remaining open you find that the walls speak back in silent
whispers gently wisely and compassionately this is the language of
the heart and you open yourself to it completely
[Music] you do not have to search for any
answers you trust that they will come in their own time patience and peace arise
within you
[Music]
you [Music]
the cave sends its wisdom enough
form of whispers visions and inner sensations though not all at once this
mystical cave knows that some answers require extra time to be revealed and
that when the time is right the answers will be provided you open your heart
even wider sinking further into the peaceful and serene energy of this cave
spend a few more silent moments listening to the wisdom of the wars that
surround you the mind remains quiet as the heart remains receptive
[Music]
coming now to a deeply settled state you turn your head to blow out the candle
that is beside you your mind is calm your heart is warm and your spirit is
nourished notice a deep trust arising
within you a completely calm presence radiates throughout your entire being
all at once there is no separation between you and this mystical cave an
overwhelming sense of oneness comes over you [Music]
[Music] as you sing further and further into
this deep tranquility of darkness your body returns to the physical reality of
the room that you rest in witness the surface now your body rests
on observing quietly all the tangible
items supporting you here and now feel
into this supremely calm state allowing your breath to rock you closer and
closer towards sleep all images melt
away from the heart and mind as you come back to a place of deep physical
presence
notice the air around your body the
warmth of blankets and cushions the heaviness of your limbs your torso your
head and the rest of your body
[Music]
each breath travels deeply into your lungs transporting vital life energy to
every cell of your body you can rest
with ease knowing that as you sleep this process is being taken care of by the
body's innate wisdom there is nothing
else for you to do nothing else for you to ask think believe or create all that
the heart yearns for now is this deep sense of peace and contentment to carry
you into a peaceful night's sleep
as you breathe your conscious awareness begins to melt away asleep comes to
restore your entire being continue to
follow the breath quietly and effortlessly until everything slips away
soon you will enter into a peaceful slumber where the caves mystical
energies will replenish you entirely mind body and heart
[Music]
welcome to this bedtime meditation designed to promote more peaceful and
soothing dreams whether you have experienced difficult dreams lately or
an absence of dreams this meditation will help to set the stage for beautiful
imagery to visit you as you sleep while listening to this meditation simply
allow your body to rest and your mind to expand as you drift into beautiful
places using the power of your attention so now I ask you to take a few deep
breaths opening yourself to this powerful practice of visualization
before we set the stage for better dreams to come to you let's take a
journey into the body and mind exactly as it is now to prepare I invite you to
make yourself entirely comfortable lie down in any position that is comfortable
to you however you rest remain mindful of keeping the neck in line with the
spine to help promote a sense of openness and relaxation within the body
proper posture even when sleeping helps to promote positive feelings that will
carry over into sleep making any final
adjustments necessary just allow yourself to come into a state of
complete stillness the only observable
movement now should be the breath as it makes its way through the body opening
the chest and expanding the belly
[Music]
as you witness your body coming into stillness notice how the breath naturally slows
itself
[Music] you might even allow a deep sigh of relief to leave the body on an
exhalation releasing any unnecessary tension or concern that lingers in your
body [Music]
[Music] begin to open your senses up to the world around you beginning with your
ears start to become mindful of the quiet space that is around you and of
any sounds that pass through this sense of stillness when opening the ears there
is no need to search for noises or to label any sounds that arise simply
observe whatever is going on around you through your sense of hearing
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
become aware now of the physical space you reside in noticing the sensations of
the surface beneath you of any cushions or blankets above or against you notice
if there is any particular sensation of the air around you does it appear to be
still or in flow is it cool warm or
possibly neutral
just allow your physical body and its capacity to feel the ground you deeper
into this present moment
[Music]
[Music] I invite you now to move a little
further into the body following the movement of air into your lungs tune in
to the sensations of it as it enters and leaves you as the belly rises and as it
falls
without attempting to change the breath in any way
allow it to carry you further into the experience of inner stillness even
amidst its constant flow
[Music] allow the physical body to settle
reaching a point of complete ease and comfort if you feel it is necessary to
adjust your position in any way just move slowly and mindfully as you come
into a place of deeper comfort [Music]
[Music] take a moment now to observe the mind
you might find that thoughts and associated feelings linger beneath the
surface of an otherwise very still state
if thoughts are present simply observe
them from a place of compassion and non judgment just see if it's possible to
observe them as an outsider without becoming consumed by the stories they
tell and then return your attention to the breath [Music]
at any point you can use the breath as a tool to draw you back into a present
state of awareness
when we draw our attention to the mind during meditation we might find that
enchanting visuals accompany the stories we tell the point of this meditation is
not to banish or look down upon this imagery that we create unconsciously
meditation is simply a call to become more conscious and mindful of what is
happening inside of our heads the mind
is a powerful tool that can either entrap us in imagery informed by fear or
that can be used to enhance our lives and create more positive beliefs ideas
and dreams take a few moments now to
practice being an outside observer of thoughts and imagery that appear in the
mind simply become more attuned to the way that your thoughts give life to your
visions knowing that you hold the power to turn your attention away from any
storyline that is guided by fear worry or anxiety
[Music]
rather than force your thoughts to become something you might deem to be more positive take this time to let all
thoughts dissolve continue to focus on the breath moving through you as you
sink further and further away from mentor distractions
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
with each inhalation you might envision yourself being infiltrated with
lightness peace and contentment and with
each outward breath you can imagine that all negative and unconstructive thoughts
and beliefs are being released allow
yourself to become completely at ease within this present moment
[Music]
take another moment to feel into your physical body knowing that you are
entirely supported in this moment physically emotionally and spiritually
and that even through this simple act of
slowing down you are beginning to invite more positive dreams into your evening
sleep from this deep sense of underlying
stillness I invite you now to use the power of your mind to enter a visual
place of peace beauty and serenity
there are no rules as to what this place should look like so long as it brings
you a sense of inner peace
the place you choose might be a beach a mountain range a lake or somewhere
further afield perhaps somewhere far into outer space this is your vision
take a few moments now to settle on your preferred location allowing it to
enliven itself in your mind's eye
commit your awareness to building this peaceful space in your mind allow it to
expand naturally alongside your growing sense of inner tranquility build it
using the blessing of all of your five senses
[Music]
unioned your sense of sight first allowing your visual sense to build this
place of your truest dreams
[Music] what colors and textures are present to
the eyes other animals plants or other
humans around you here
what does the sky look like from where you look out what elements are present
[Music] simply tuned into the visual presence of
fire earth water and air if any or all
of these are present
[Music]
allow your creation of this space to include your sense of sound is it
completely silent where you are or are there subtle noises present possibly
there's a recognizable beat or rhythm in any sounds that might be growing in this
space or are the sounds disorderly like the
unpredictable pitter-patter of rain
simply allow that whatever brings you peace to arise in this place of beauty
[Music]
tuning in now to your sense of smell are there any recognizable aromas that
are present here from the smell of salty
water to fresh earth and autumn leaves allow nature's aromas to trickle into
this imagery you are resting within and if nothing arises that is fine too there
are no rules to what your mind creates so long as it brings you comfort
consider your sense of taste now allowing your experience here to delight
your taste buds as you explore this
peaceful landscape is there anything that you feel compelled to taste you
might want to indulge in wild berries in pure spring water or in some of a
worldly treat born in outer space just
allow your experience to be rich divine and fulfilling nourishing your entire
being
and as you explore this place either walking slowly through it or from a
resting position allow yourself to feel into it through your physical body
what nourishing surfaces does your body come into contact with
how does the air feel against your skin
thus the Sun or moon beamed down on you filling you with a sense of ease and
enchantment just allow whatever brings
you deep peace to express itself here
[Music] now I invite you now to tune into this
place you have created with a sixth sense that is with your hearts feeling
as you breathe and vision your heart
expanding with each inhalation and softening with each exhalation
[Music]
with each breath allow your heart to open up to the piece you have just built
within you let this space nourish your
innermost being wholeheartedly
take a few more moments to allow yourself to play rest or recharge in
this beautiful and tranquil environment you have conjured use each of your
senses including your heart to explore
this moment as fully as possible
[Music]
[Music]
in this very moment you feel a deep sense of care love and support granted
to you by the universe by the beautiful space you have created and by your
highest self and clearest mind [Music]
everything in this space and time is exactly as it is meant to be and you
feel highly attuned with all that is around you
slowly I invite you now to gently release the
imagery you have created letting go of the taste and texture and the sights and
sounds
gently release your vision of this beautiful place knowing that in some way
on some other field of reality it is still very present within you even
as the images fade away you maintain the heartfelt sensations this visualization
opened you up to inside of you there is a deep sense of peace beauty and
contentment [Music]
come back now to the breath watching it flow gently and steadily through you
[Music]
you
as you return to this physical reality that you are in you begin to feel more
grounded and present within your environment there is a deeper sense of
that inner stillness you know is always within you so take a moment to draw your
awareness through the body blessing the entirety of your physical being with
deep rest and relaxation release any
constriction in the belly the chest area
soften and loosen
the jaw release [Music]
and your forward allow the entire body
to relax completely as you prepare to enter the dream world
[Music] as you settle into a state very close to
sleep little pieces of your peaceful paradise linger in the back of your mind
unconsciously through the power of this
visualization you have set the stage for beautiful dreams to carry you through
the night ahead all tension worry and
fear have melted away and in its place nothing but lightness and peace remains
allow your breath to continue rocking you to sleep alongside each breath cycle
you might silently repeat this following affirmation until slowly this awakens
state drifts away my dreams are filled
with beautiful visions my dreams are
filled with beautiful visions my dreams
are filled with beautiful visions
keep your heart and mind wide open your
body rooted in a sense of inner peace and harmony and allow the infinite
possibilities for beauty to infiltrate your dreams continue whispering silently
my dreams are filled with beautiful visions
my dreams are filled with beautiful
visions until this wish becomes a
slumbering reality
[Music]

[Music]
welcome to this guided meditation to help you release all muscular tension
and to help you fall into a deep and peaceful sleep over the course of this
meditation you will be guided to bring your awareness to each area of the body
to feel into it to tighten it and then
to release it completely allowing the entire body to come to a state of total
relaxation so before we begin this
journey just ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of if you require
an alarm to be set just quietly set it now if there are blinds that need to be
drawn or bright lights that can be turned off just take care of these small
matters before settling into a comfortable lying down position
you [Music]
wherever you are ensure that the spine and neck are straight but relaxed and
that you are supported in any way that you need take your time to adjust any
cushions or blankets so that you are as comfortable as possible in this very
moment
[Music]
set an intention now to fully let go through both body and mind as we enter a
process of complete release
[Music] you now let's begin by becoming more mindful
of this exact moment in time and space
begin by drawing your awareness to your ears and to all the sounds that you may
currently be infiltrating through them
as you open your hearing simply observe all the sounds that come from subtle
hums to more prominent noises outside [Music]
without judging or labeling these sounds practice remaining in a state of deep
awareness as vibrations filter into your eardrums and as they disappear
[Music]
[Music]
allow the Mayans tendencies to categorize to label and the judge to
step aside as you simply witness these noises as dynamic expressions of life as
simple and subtle vibrations of energy
now expand your awareness of this present moment by beginning to observe
the physical space you rest in notice
the air that touches your skin and the material world that supports and
surrounds you
take a few moments to observe each inch of your body that is in contact with the
physical world you might come to notice
the temperature of your body and surfaces around you you might observe
the textures of blankets and pillows that brush against your skin and you
might even observe a barely describable feeling of support of safety or of
heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you
[Music]
notice if the body's formation or sensory experience changes in any way as
you become more mindful of this physical space you are in
[Music]
become more mindful now of your breath quietly observing the rhythm and depth
of its present form [Music]
[Music] to be mindful does not mean to change or
to manipulate the present moment in any way that the mind deemed to make better
or worthy to the contrary mindful
awareness asks us to open to and to accept this moment exactly as it is so
with this in mind see if you can open to your breath exactly as it is right now
releasing any judgment or expectation for it to feel any differently and it
presently does
[Music] you
if a natural deepening occurs allow this
simply noticing it as a natural movement of energy further into your being
continue to observe the breath for a few more moments feeling into the expression
of each inhalation and each exhalation
notice the feeling of air entering through your nasal cavity filling your
lungs and pressing upward against your
belly
and then notice the same dynamic movement in Reverse observing any
sensations connected to your fall exhalation
[Music] just breathe here in mindful awareness
for a few more silent moments [Music]
if the mind wanders at any point during this meditation see if you can refrain
from judgment as you compassionately call your attention back to the present
moment it is in the mines nature to wander but
with that said we can use the power of our intention to refocus our attention
back on this present moment this
refocusing is what helps us to enter an expanding state of complete of
relaxation
in just a few moments we will enter into a full-body scan through which you will
become deeply aware of the presence of tightness in the body and then of the
feeling of complete relaxation you will
be guided to witness tighten and release each area that we pass allowing each
part of the body that come to deep rest and complete ease in preparation for a
peaceful night's sleep [Music]
as much as possible see if you can align tightening movements with your
inhalations and all movements towards release with your exhalations
just breathe naturally in between each muscle group that we work on so before
we begin into this body scan I invite you to make any adjustments now that
will help you to feel into the entirety of your body you might find that it is
easiest to access each muscle when in a straight line down position on your back
however if this is not comfortable for you come into a position that is as
neutral as possible while remaining comfortable
[Music] ensure that the chest is open with
shoulders drawing away from the ears
allow your breath to continue to be in the background of your awareness
secondary only to your gently shifting awareness of the physical body so begin
by noticing your toes feeling into them exactly as they are in this moment
[Music]
notice if there are any sensations present any tightness or softness
[Music]
and now consciously tighten just your toes on your next inhalation
observing what it feels like for them to be pulled inwards completely and then
exhale letting them go and allowing all tension melting away with these
now bring your awareness towards both feet toes and ankles included
[Music] observing them exactly as they are in this moment on the next breath in tense
all muscles in the feet area holding
tightly for just a brief moment and then release all of the tension on your
exhalation allowing your feet toes and
then goes to rest back down completely and breathing normally for a few moments
[Music]
[Music] observe now the presence of both of your
legs drawing your awareness all the way from your heels up to your hips noting
any sensations you pass along the way
hold the entirety of both legs in your awareness and then inhale as you tighten
these muscles squeezing them in towards
your midline
hold there for a moment and then exhale releasing them completely into the
surface beneath you [Music]
moving to the area between the hips draw your awareness to your pelvis on your
next breath in tighten all of these muscles holding them for just a brief
moment and then release them completely on your next breath out just feeling to
this complete release from your pelvis downward letting each of these areas
sink further into the support of the physical world
observe the stomach region now becoming aware of its present state
[Music] and then as you inhale tighten all of
these core muscles holding them in tightly for just a moment as you hold
the breath in and then release entirely as you exhale softening all muscles
around the belly return to your natural
breathing rhythm as you relax the stomach completely now expand your
awareness of the stomach to encompass the entire torso from lower back to
upper and from belly up to the shoulders
take a moment now to observe each muscle group in the core of your body
[Music] now on your next inhalation tighten them
or towards the midline of your body feeling them in a contracted state and
then release heavily with a sigh allowing your entire torso to relax
completely [Music]
take a moment here to reconnect with your breath mindfully observing its
present form
bring your awareness now to your hands fingers included observe the way they
are resting in this moment noticing if they are relaxed or tense or somewhere
in between
as you inhale allow all of these muscles in the hands and fingers to tighten
coming into a compressed fist hold for a
brief second or two and then exhale as you release
allowing both hands to rest completely relaxed
draw your awareness now from your wrists all the way up to your shoulders and
compasses and areas in between so inhale
as you contract all of these muscles perhaps pulling them up towards your
ears and then soften releasing all of
these muscles in the limbs back down shoulders falling back down gently as
well notice how different it feels in
both body and mind between your contracted States and your
softened ones
now begin to observe all of the intricate muscles in your face
noticing if there are any sensations present here [Music]
consider the muscles in your jaw your
cheeks your eyebrows and your forward
now inhale as you contract all of these muscles squeezing your entire face
together hold for just a moment observing the sensation and then exhale
as you release all of these muscles completely let go of each muscle
allowing all tension to drain away
take a moment to come back to your breath for just a moment observing the
entire body right where it is and right as it is
[Music]
observe this neutral state just for a moment and then on your next inhalation
contract every muscle group accessible to your awareness squeezing the entirety
of your body towards your midline hold everything together with the breath held
in and then release completely letting a deep sigh escape from your lungs as all
remaining tension and stress falls away
allow each muscle to melt into the surface beneath you allow your breath to
return to its normal rhythm as you sink further and further into the experience
of this complete relaxation [Music]
continue to breathe naturally mindfully observing the flow of air into and out
of your being in this state of deep
relaxation and release there is absolutely nothing to do but be entirely
present with every muscle group relaxed
completely you are moments away from drifting into a peaceful sleep that is
in alignment with your present state of tranquillity
allow your breath to become like waves your body is soft and gentle as the
water beneath the surface
as you breathe notice yourself being rocked gently into an even deeper state
of tranquillity the mind follows the
body's lead quietening softening as you
come into harmony with everything within and around you
with every inch of your being having been consciously relaxed allow yourself
to float effortlessly into a deep slumber allow your breath and the sounds
to soothe your entire being as you slowly but surely descend completely
into restorative and peaceful night's sleep [Music]
and allow these affirmations to sink into your subconscious mind even if you
do fall asleep trust that these affirmations will assist you as you
drift deeper deeper into sleep
