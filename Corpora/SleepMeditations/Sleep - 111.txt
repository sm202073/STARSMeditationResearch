allow me to be your guide to effortlessly slow down the momentum from your day
tonight release any worries and welcome sleep to come easily and
quickly to you by inviting relaxation into your body
and mind hello and welcome to the mindful
movement i'm sarah raymond allow my voice to guide you on a journey
to tranquil sleep thank you so much for joining me
now i invite you to make yourself comfortable
take a moment and make sure your environment is all set for you to safely
drift into sleep
settle into comfort for the night
as you allow your eyes to gently close down
let this simple act be a signal to your body and mind
that it is time to sleep deeply
and every time you hear my voice say the words sleep deeply
you can sense peaceful sleep easily and effortlessly
coming to you
give your thinking mind permission to let go of thoughts
release worry and glide freely into sleep
take a few deep breaths to continue the settling process
invite the weight of the day to be released from your shoulders
there is no need to carry it any longer
notice any physical sensations that draw your attention
become aware of where your body makes contact with the surface below you
let this connection ground you
feel this as support and give yourself permission to be
fully supported
because now is your time to sleep deeply
you are safe
use this sensation of where you and your support meet
to draw your awareness gradually from your outer experience
to your inner world
there is nothing you need to do or accomplish in this moment
allow my soothing words to flow effortlessly through you
to welcome deep sleep
if you find your mind wanders come back to the sound of my voice
and the relaxing words i am saying
as you continue to relax physically even deeper
allow your attention to move inward to rest easily on your breath
notice the air as it moves in and out through your nose
feel your breath from within
as it comes in and as it goes out
like an ocean wave rolling into the shore
and back out again
your attention on the wave of your breath
will aid in deepening your peaceful state
and allow sleep to easily come to you without any
effort
and now encouraging your breath to support your relaxation
even further
after your next exhale
begin to breathe in more deeply directing your breath into your belly
pause for a moment at the top
exhale fully and slowly
then pause again following your exhale
again take a deep breath in filling your belly
hold at the top for a moment then slowly breathe out sensing
your belly soften
after you exhale hold for just a second and then begin again
continue to breathe in this way for a few more breath cycles on your own
letting each inhalation and each exhalation
be slow and full
you may notice your belly rise and fall with each cycle
while there are many things in life that you don't have control over
your breath is one aspect that you can direct a bit
become aware of your physical body
notice any areas that may be holding on to tension
unintentionally whatever part of you draws your focus
most prominently allow your attention to linger here
and welcome a softening into this part of your body
perhaps you're noticing some tension releasing from the small muscles around your eyes
or in the area of your neck and shoulders
or maybe you are able to release
your belly and back
as you allow your attention to flow throughout your body easily
and effortlessly in this moment
you can surrender more completely
to the supportive surface below you
if there is lingering tension send warm loving thoughts
and energy to this part of you
in your mind's eye notice now the palms of your hands
notice the energy here
perhaps you feel this as warmth or tingling
or a buzzing sensation
notice how simply moving your awareness to this part of your body
moves your energy to this point
by simply paying attention you can move energy
and move a positive sensation within you
now begin to widen the experience of your sensations
outward from your hands
become aware of the sensations throughout your body
feel the energy moving within you
be in your body
inhabit your body fully
simply allow your focus to tune into the sensations of your body
right here right now
all you must do is think about relaxing
and releasing the tension in your body
and your body will respond because it listens to what your mind
tells it
and now as you ask for this release
feel your entire body let go
feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen
and subside
let go and drift effortlessly into peace
let go of any thoughts of worry
any thoughts that might be holding you back from experiencing tranquility
thoughts holding you back from sleep
see these thoughts drift off in the wave of relaxation
they will be there when you need them in the calm state of your mind
let go of worries so you can sleep peacefully now
let go of anything you may be holding on to
from yesterday or earlier today
let go of anything that may be taking up space in your mind
give yourself permission to be right here right now doing just
this sometimes it is helpful to
invite the idea of offering yourself permission
to let go of the past
give yourself some space space for something new
space to grow into
like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow down
in relationship to each breath
as your breath and your mind slow
notice the space between each breath
and the similar space or pause between your thoughts
come back to noticing your breath when you find your mind wandering
so that your mind can continue to clear the clutter of the overthinking
tendency know that your subconscious mind
will be aware of anything that is important to you
you are in complete control but for now your mind
and body no it is time to relax
time to let go time to slow down
right now any sounds around you are unimportant
and they simply add to your relaxation
all responsibilities and items on your to-do list are
unimportant right now
all you need to do is follow the soothing sound of my voice
as a guide and allow your body to relax
and your subconscious mind will do the job of clearing the clutter
notice how deep and calm your breath has become
as you continue to relax deeper and deeper
allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation
letting yourself go letting your body
mind and spirit become one
and now that you are in a deep state of relaxation
begin to use your imagination and take a moment
to see yourself in front of a beautifully decorated glass
elevator door
this glass door is etched and frosted with the most amazing design
on it see this design in your mind
reach out and feel the texture with your fingertips
feel the cool temperature of the glass
this elevator will take you down to the deepest part of your subconscious
mind that you can declutter your thoughts
release tension and negativity
you see the door slowly opening and inviting you to step into
the spacious elevator you know without a doubt you are
completely safe and you can see through the glass walls of the elevator
you push the b button so that you can go down to the basement
of your mind
this elevator will lead you deep into relaxation
each level will take you deeper down
and in a moment as i begin to count
the elevator will take you down slowly into a deeply relaxed
state you will find that the deeper you go
down the more comfortable and the more
relaxed you will become

sleep beginning the slow relaxing descent down

descent you are deeply relaxed

moving on to nine you feel yourself completely letting go
of any responsibilities or things you may need to do moving down to eight

even deeper into the perfect healing relaxed
state moving down to sixth you feel yourself
going deeper into relaxation deeper into a connection with yourself
moving down to five letting go completely

and now on to three almost to the basement of your subconscious mind where you
have the amazing ability to plant the seeds
of powerful positive beliefs

and finally down to one all the way into a deep state
of relaxation and peace
and now you have reached the bottom the elevator doors slowly open
and you walk out into the basement of your subconscious mind

into what looks like a library
you see that this space stores all of your memories as well as
the possibilities for your future
there are rows and rows of shelves
throughout the entire room
each shelf is filled with many many books
you see books of all different sizes and colors
take a moment to look around and see the deepest part of your
subconscious mind and what is stored here
you might notice some of the books are disorganized
and there are areas of clutter around the floor in front of some of the
shelves
