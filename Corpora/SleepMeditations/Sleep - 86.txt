I give light and I receive light I am iridescent
and I'm energized By the Light around me
where there is Darkness I create and send light
I am resilient I get back up
I am resilient I am enough
I am resilient I Let Go
I am resilient I forgive
I am resilient I get back up foreign
resilient I accept
waves coming in and out the Sun
set I am resilient I get back up
I am resilient I am enough [Music]

son has set it is so peaceful all around his face
profound pace a sense of belonging a sense of it's okay
[Music] it is okay
feeling comfort with what is as it is
understanding that we can change ourselves we choose our Behavior feeling and
thoughts not easy but possible
we understand that we cannot change the behavior of another
we cannot create their feelings and thoughts
we accept it's okay
sitting in the moment now in peace in quiet
imagine now that you were lying back on a bed of green Lush grass
soft grass hop on your back you feel comfortable
you are safe
you're lying with your feet slightly apart falling out to the side your arms are out your palms are up
[Music] your face is facing up
you release you release
you notice any possible residual blockages in your physical form
[Music] you journey to those blockages with understanding and acceptance and you
release the blockages
you release you let go
you journey through your own physical form releasing and letting go
releasing and letting go
as you release and let go you feel healed
[Music] you feel aware you feel calm
the behavior of others does not reflect Who You Are
sentiment of others does not define you
you choose to be one with the light you choose to be peaceful
choose to accept you choose to let go
release and say to yourself if you choose to do so
I choose I choose
I choose
and choose I am the light I bear the light I send
light I receive light I choose
[Music] I choose I know that choosing is a
practice choosing requires repetition the development of a skill
[Music] choose to practice choose to practice
I practice I practice [Music]
I allow my imperfect self I allow my imperfect growth
I allow I allow my own development through the
mistakes I may make it's okay
give myself I allow myself
I accept the journey
I accept the journey
