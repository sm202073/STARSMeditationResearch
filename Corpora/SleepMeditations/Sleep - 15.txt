hello and welcome to this guided meditation and visualization that will
help you to cleanse negative energy from both mind and body before leading you
into a restorative night's sleep my name
is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to set the world you know aside as you open
your heart and mind to the possibility of awakening new inspired energy to
begin take a moment to find a comfortable lying down position and
using whatever blankets and pillows you need for support and then closing your
eyes when you're ready
soften your brow [Music] your jaw
and your limbs just allowing your entire body to soften into the surface beneath
you
before we dive deeper into this visualization let's take a moment to
mindfully tune into the present moment beginning with the breath noticing the
path that your breath takes as it moves through you beginning as it enters your
nostrils moves through your windpipe and
fills your lungs
and then notice the same path but in Reverse watching how the chest and belly
soften as you exhale
[Music]
observe that gentle subtle movement of the body as you breathe becoming more
aware of the aliveness of your being
and now as the breath enters I invite you to draw your attention towards the
stomach welcoming the breath to flow all the way into it and as you exhale let
the belly soften completely
just take a few more deep belly breaths on your own now
perhaps releasing a softer sigh with your next view exhalations
and now I invite you to let the breath expand even further by imagining each
inhalation reaching into the furthest corners of your body into your toes your
fingertips and your crown
and when you come to exhale imagine the breath taking with it any and all
tension lingering anywhere within the body
you breathe into the fullness of your being
and then invite your entire body to release as you exhale
take just a few more full-body breaths on your own
when you were ready to let go of even this breathing technique let your breath
resume its natural pace depth and rhythm
in a few moments we will begin a visualization that will help you to
cleanse any negative energy you may be holding and as we move through this
practice I invite you to remain compassionate and patient towards
yourself softening any judgement if it arises I
encourage this because it is not uncommon that we feel shame guilt or
judgment when we consider that we have been harnessing negative thoughts
feelings or other energies and yet all
of these things are a part of the human experience they offer us opportunities
to learn evolve and awaken
regardless of where this negative energy may have come from I invite you to
release any stories you might hold about wrongdoing
and by softening shame and guilt and through opening up to ourselves with
compassion and patience we lovingly create space to release what no longer
serves us and to invite in the energy that will
so take a moment now to draw your attention to the crown of your head
gently softening any tension you might observe here or in the space of the
third eye
relax your shoulders
your arms release your belly
and any other unnecessary tension and
then come back to your breath as we prepare to cleanse our energy field
through the power of this visualization
calling upon your innate capacity for imagination now I invite you to envision
that you are on a small chartered boat sailing calmly and gently towards the
shore of a pristine tropical island
you sit or stand at the prow breathing in the fresh salty breeze of the open
sea around you
you have charted this small boat for an island getaway for a chance to rest
reset and cleanse yourself of any negative energy you've been exposed to
or have been holding on to
and as the boat nears the dock at the shore you feel your shoulders releasing
some of the unnecessary weight they've been carrying
no breathing deepens
and finally the boat pulls up against the dock overhanging the turquoise
waters
you carefully step on to the steady dock turning to thank the captain and to let
him know that you will be back later in the day then you head on your way your
backpack is full of all you need for the day and so pulling the straps tight now
you begin your journey through the pathway that leads through the tropical
jungle oasis
palm trees and other lush greenery line the narrow trail you find yourself on
birds ring out in the trees overhead as do chirping insects and croaking
amphibians
the air is completely free of any man-made sounds you relish in this in
the purity of the symphony that fills your ears
already you can feel your lungs being cleansed your breath moving deeper and
your body being filled with pristine air full of vitality
you continued on a little while longer weaving through the jungle of this
private island
[Music] eventually you come across a shimmering
Azure Blue Lagoon just off to your right
you take a moment's pause here kneeling down by the water's edge
something about this Lagoon feels enchanted something tells you that the
water is listening that it is aware of your presence
so you take this as an invitation to consciously set the intention to release
any negative energy that has been harbored within you take a moment to
formulate this intention in your own words
and when you were ready you whisper this intention to the pristine mystic waters
before you
you sense that simply through having set this intention something has been
released and that the process of deep cleansing and rejuvenation has been
upgraded
so you take a few final moments to absorb the beauty of this Lagoon
and then you continue along the path that has gotten ooh this far
continuing to make your way through the lush environment you've retreated to you
feel a deep sense of gratitude for this opportunity to clear your energy field
[Music] not only do you thank the environment
that is supporting you now but you also feel a sense of appreciation for the
part of you that made this retreat a priority you thank yourself for this act
of self-care
you carry on until soon the path widens
slowly transitioning from soil to sand
and as you make your way through the last layers of trees on this opposite
side of the island your jaw drops at the purity of the white sand beach before
you and at the calm turquoise waters
that ripple out from the island you've
arrived at a place where you can allow all remaining negativity to be cleared
from your being you are certain that this is the place for it
and so you take off your shoes carrying
them in one hand as you walk closer towards the water you walk slowly
allowing your feet to sink into the warm sand with each step
a few meters from where the soft wave slap against the shore you drop your bag
and your shoes letting your feet ground into the sand rooting yourself through
your feet you then stretch your arms up towards the sky your heart opens as your
chest pushes forward welcoming the radiance of the Sun the sky and sea
you let your arms come to rest by your sides now as you gaze out over the open
waters with not a single other landmass
inside you feel as if you're a world away from the everyday you take a deep
breath in and letting it go with a sigh
and then you lay out your towel and prepare to head into the calm and cleansing waters
you remember the intention you had said to cleanse yourself of any negative
energies perhaps negative thoughts feelings habits or more subtle energies that no
longer serve you and as you begin
walking towards the water you invite these negative energies to come to the
forefront of your mind and you hold them
here not to judge criticize or condemn
them but to silently let them know that you can see them and to let them know
that it is time for them to be let go
[Music]
slowly wading into the water you let the cool sea brush against your skin
beginning to cleanse you from the outside
continuing on until you are waist-deep you pause and then you bring your palms
together in front of your body inviting all negative energies to be held between
them
raising your arms up and overhead you let these negative energies begin moving
away from your body
and you throw them forward sending them off into the sea
as your hands dip underwater all the negative energies you once held begin to
dissolve in the salty water that surrounds you you let the water to
continue to cleanse you of all negative energies that you do not wish to hold on
to
you can even watch all the negative attachments float away from you
[Music] all negative beliefs and stories
all self-limiting beliefs
and any of the negative energies you've picked up from the world around you all
of it is now dissolving in the ocean
feel free to roll on your back floating here safely for some time as the
sunshine beams down on you
[Music]
slowly the subtle waves carry you back towards the shoreline and as you get
closer you rise to your feet and slowly make your way back onto the beach
resting your back on your towel you lie down here and let the Sun and the
Seabreeze continue to cleanse you you
notice there is far more room to breathe now to breathe in light love and
positivity the negative energies you
once held now feel so distant and all
you are left with is room to grow new ideas new beliefs and new dreams and to
conjure up new energies you feel immensely blessed for this
transformation
and as the Sun beams down on you you sense it awakening each and every cell
in your body
it awakens the cells in your toes your
feet
your lower legs
your knees and your thighs
it reinvigorates the cells in your hips your pelvis and your root chakra
[Music] it brings new life to your belly your
lower back your chest and your heart and
your upper back
and in the same way it awakens all the cells in your arms from your fingertips
right up to your shoulders
the cells and energy center in your throat awakens to as do all the cells in
your face
finally the top of your head the crown area
opens up to the sunlight completely becoming a portal for positive energy to
flow through your entire body
you are fully alive here fully awake and
positively inspired
you come back to your breath letting each inhalation spread throughout your
entire body and each exhalation to
soften you you melt into the sand a
little bit further with each breath knowing there is nothing you need to hold on to here
a great wave of compassion washes through you as you bless yourself but
the places you've been and the courage of harnessed to arrive here letting go
and allowing for cleansing to happen is not always easy and so you feel immense
appreciation to yourself for opening up in this way
[Music] you also feel a growing compassion for all those who've crossed your path for
those who have been weighed down by their own negative energy - you see the
goodness and light at the core of everything
you spend just a few more moments here on the sand beneath the Sun
and then you slowly rise to your feet and prepare to head back to the boat
that awaits you
you take one last look at the beach and see that so graciously held you offering
them your thanks and you turn towards
the path that brought you here slowly venturing back into the tropical
abyss
as you walk you feel a lightness in your
steps and in your entire body you move
with ease and grace all parts of you are now deeply cleansed
soon you make your way back to the lagoon where you had powerfully set your
intention you pause at its edge letting
an inner smile spread through you
all of a sudden the tropical Symphony begins to grow louder the birds chirp
with glee from their perches the frogs croak with contentment and the insects
sing in their own way it sounds to you
as though the jungle is applauding rejoicing in this return to your natural
state of being
you continue on your way leaving the lagoon behind positive energy continues
to spread through you
eventually you arrive back at the outer limits of the jungle noting the dock and
the boat that awaits you slowly you make
your way over towards it thanking the captain for his time
you climb back in taking a comfortable
seat on the boat and as it slowly pulls
away from the dock and the island you look back in love and admiration of your
experience here you consider how
unconditionally you were held by the sand and by the sea feeling in complete
alignment with the world you thank the
sea for cleansing you of the energies you no longer needed and you imagine
these energies slowly sinking to the ocean floor where they will be
transformed into their raw pure elements
[Music] as the boat continues towards the
nearest mainland you let your back come to rest on its surface it's smooth and
steady journey across the water lulls you towards slumber a state that will
continue to process all of the transformation you experienced here
you take one more deep breath in of the sea breeze and as you exhale you gently
release the imagery of this beautiful cleansing landscape
grounding yourself back into the surface that supports you in this reality
carrying the experience of being cleansed into the awakened life notice
the natural ebb and flow of your breathing using it to anchor you anytime
the mind wanders in these next few moments before sleep and as you slowly
drift off let the following affirmations flow through you to reaffirm the
cleansing that has taken place as these words float through your subconscious
mind they will help to embed this new reality into your daily life
