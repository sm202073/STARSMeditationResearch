hello and welcome to this short
mindfulness meditation to help increase
your awareness of both breath
and body in this present moment
my name is jason stevenson and i invite
you to simply follow my words of
guidance
as we move through this meditation
and know that there is nothing you need
to know
and no experience you need to have in
order to practice this
so to begin just take a moment to let
yourself come to a comfortable
seated position or lying down if that's
comfortable for you
you can be in a chair on the bench
seated on the floor or whatever
is most comfortable
and wherever you find yourself just take
a moment to check in with your posture
ensuring that your spine and neck form
one straight line and your shoulders are
relaxed just rest your hands in your lap
your knees or your thighs and then close
your eyes if you've not done so
now take a few silent moments to let
your mind arrive
in this present moment
[Music]
often when we go into meditation it
takes the mind a few moments to settle
in
to let go of its attachment to the past
or
its ideas about the future
you can help it to arrive by simply
tuning into the surface beneath you
noting what it feels like to be held by
gravity
against the floor or the chair below you
once you feel firmly grounded and
connected to the earth beneath you
just let your attention shift gently
towards the breath
without looking for anything in
particular in the breath's flow
simply observe its movement
into and out of your body
you might notice the temperature of the
surrounding air
as it enters your nostrils
or the feeling of the body expanding
and contracting with each breath cycle
if you notice the mind wandering at any
point
simply notice this movement with
patience
curiosity and compassion
and note that it's entirely natural for
the mind to wander so practice
non-judgment when you notice that this
is occurring
just silently invite your attention
back to the breath when you notice that
thoughts have pulled
your attention away
[Music]
now i invite you to let your attention
and your awareness broaden to hold your
entire physical body
within the scope of its lens
notice what it feels like to be here
to fully occupy your physical being in
this
moment
[Music]
just as was the case when you observe
the breath
there is nothing unusual or particular
you need to look for
tuning into the body is a process of
simply
connecting with the subtle sensations of
being alive
you might notice tingling tension
contraction or expansion
or even numbness or any other barely
traceable sensations just
simply notice what is here inside of you
[Music]
now let your attention focus in on a
single sensation
you may have come to observe
if nothing has stood out to you simply
let your awareness land on either
the heart space or your third eye area
just in the middle of your brows
[Music]
whatever point of the body your
attention has landed on
i invite you just to stay with that
notice what is there and
even if that feels like numbness or
emptiness
just notice be with it
and refrain from judging any sensations
as
good or bad just watch with openness
and just see what happens
[Music]
if or when the sensation dissolves just
gently
shift your focus to another single point
in the body
alternatively you can stay exactly where
you are
continuing to be present with that
original
point of interest
[Music]
now i invite you to consider
is there any part of your body that
might be yearning for
some love or attention
and let your attention on that place
or stay where it is at the present
and then imagine as if you are breathing
nourishing energy into that part of your
body with each breath
so with each inhalation you might
envision a gold
healing light being sent to that
area of your attention
and with each breath out you might
envision that same light
carrying away any tension or stagnant
energy
[Music]
inhale loving energy to nurture this
single point in your physical body
and exhale all tension away
now i invite you to broaden your
awareness once again
slowly expanding your attention to hold
your entire physical body
and then continue to inhale those loving
breaths or that golden light
letting each breath nurture every cell
of your body
just imagine that your entire body
each cell each muscle and each organ
is breathing in and out
now soften your forehead
relax your belly
and then slowly let all visuals fade as
you
come back to the natural flow
of your breath
and ground yourself once again in the
surface beneath you
and when you were ready to close this
practice slowly open your eyes
[Music]
and as you move through your day
remember that you can always come back
to the immediate sensations of your
breath and
body to find peace presence
and grounding thanks for joining me
today
[Music]
you
