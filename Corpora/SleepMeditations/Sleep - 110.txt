good evening to you welcome to the mindful movement I'm Sara Raymond and
tonight it's time to relax I'm going to guide you on a journey for complete body
and mind relaxation tonight's guided meditation focuses on
effortless relaxation and stress relief to guide you into a deep healing sleep
take a moment before we get started and make sure you're ready to drift off to
sleep when this recording is over adjust your surroundings and turn off any
distractions so you can have the feeling of complete safety and support pause
this recording if there's anything you need to do to prepare yourself or a safe
and comfortable night sleep as we begin
allow your eyes to close gently and bring your focus to your breath
you might imagine the air you're breathing in is a warm glowing light
that fills you up and heals you from the inside take a deep breath in hold for
just a moment and then let out your
breath gently allowing any physical and emotional tension to leave your body as
you exhale again take another deep
breath in hold for a short moment and
this time take your time with your exhale slowing it down
breathing in filling up with this warm glowing light it heals you from the
inside hold for a moment and exhale as
slowly as you can letting go let it go letting go
continue to breathe in this way for a few more cycles of breath
with each breath cycle allow your exhale to slow down a little more than the
breath before it you may begin to feel
your body soften and your thoughts slow down even more with each passing breath
slowing down your exhale gives your nervous system the opportunity to come
to a calm safe state take another slow
breath in making it your deepest breath yet [Music]
and as you release that breath feel the
tension in your body has began to loosen and subside feel your body is becoming
heavy and calm
now releasing this breath pattern allow your breath to return to its natural
rhythm and flow take a moment to notice
how you are feeling notice how you're
focused breathing pattern has slowed your heart rate has quieted your mind
and has brought about a heavy sense of
calm to your physical body
with each natural breath from here forward welcome a sense of relaxation
into your body be fully present to this
moment in this moment notice your
physical body be aware of the sounds
around you
notice the surface below you and in this
moment set the intention for peace and relaxation experience peace and
relaxation not only in your physical body but also mentally and spiritually
[Music] with this intention for peace and
relaxation in mind for today open your
heart and open your mind to the
opportunity that arises in the state of
comfort [Music]
open your heart and open your mind to the healing that comes with relaxation
know that you are safe and fully
supported to let go
to improve your health and well-being as you sleep take a moment to be fully
present with the physical sensations of your body right now
[Music]
[Music] let go of distractions let go of your
responsibilities let go of expectations
of what you think this experience should be and simply surrender to the process
of relaxation
begin to give in to sleep notice what
you are feeling without changing or judging simply notice you might feel a
light tingling sensation in your palms
or perhaps you experience a floating sensation in your body that comes and
goes or you may feel a comforting
heaviness throughout your body
you may begin to notice that it feels as if there's no difference between where
your body ends and where the surface below you begins
[Music] whatever you're feeling right now is
perfect simply observe the feelings and
sensations as you continue to allow
yourself to enjoy this journey
give yourself permission to turn the whole world off and go within yourself
[Music] allowing my voice to be a guide into
deep sleep in a moment I will guide you
to slowly scan your entire body with a
relaxed awareness starting from the top of your head going all the way down
through your body to your feet as you
see each part of your body in your mind's eye give yourself permission to
relax that body part completely and as
you move your attention throughout your body scan for any areas of tension tightness
or pain to be released
if there are areas of tension allow your
focus to linger on that part of your body and breathe in warm healing light
right into this area to soften it
lovingly ask your body to relax and
release
[Music] as you continue scanning your body feel
this relaxing and healing energy move through you as it takes you deeper and
deeper into a safe and supported state
of sleep and recovery
and now let's begin the slow process of relaxing your entire body as you prepare
for a deep healing night's sleep let
your attention move to the top of your head as you become aware of this area
kindly ask your body who are a release from your scalp and head feel your
forehead soften and smooth notice the
tiny muscles around your eyebrows and eyes relaxing completely you can allow
the tension from the day to dissolve from your face feel your eyelids
becoming very heavy
unclench your jaw and relax your tongue
[Music] this softening of your face and jaw will
send a signal to the rest of your body and will deepen the state of relaxation
[Music] let your attention move to your throat
and since a softening or an opening here
you might notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to
relax deeper and deeper
allow this wave of comfort to continue its journey down your body let your
scanning attention move now to your chest and shoulders as you feel a
release allowing you to rest heavy
every breath in brings healing air into
your belly and allows your abdomen to
let go even further notice your arms now
allow both arms to relax fully feel any
tension you may have in your upper body flow out through your fingertips
continue to breathe in fresh healing oxygen into your abdomen and chest your
body can use this oxygen to recover and repair
invite this easy relaxation to continue
its path down your body into your hips
and lower back linger on this area and
lovingly ask your body for a sense of ease
[Music]
letting go here in the area of your hips and lower back feel your body softening
as each breath in creates more space for
an easy flow of energy through your body
this comfort moves into both of your legs
washing relaxation over your thighs your
knees and your calves welcome the
feeling of letting go letting go letting
go invite any remaining tension to flush
out of your body through the soles of your feet so that you are completely
relaxed throughout your entire body know
that your relaxed body will allow for a productive recovery while you sleep so
you will awake feeling refreshed and rejuvenated
you are now deeply relaxed and you can
begin to use your imagination to
visualize yourself from the outside see
yourself as if you are an observer looking down at yourself lying in your
own bed in your very own room
I will guide you on a journey taking you
into a dream state you can simply follow
my voice or drift off to sleep whenever
you are ready you don't need to do
anything simply allow your imagination
to follow my voice on this journey of relaxation enjoy this
peaceful state and welcome sleep to come
to you when you are ready
[Music]
see yourself right where you are in your
bed in your room
you are safe in your room this journey
is only taking place in your mind
imagine now that your room has a moon roof just like some cars have the
ceiling of your room can slide open with the push of a button in your mind see as
your ceiling begins to slowly open right above your head
so that it begins to reveal the open night sky directly above you even if
there is another floor above you simply allow your imagination to open to the
starry night sky above
you are still nice and cozy in your bed
completely safe and supported now you
can look up into the night sky and see
the many stars shining bright you can
see the moon lit up above you and the
clouds passing by as each cloud passes
by you notice the thoughts in your head
going along with them [Music]
you notice your body becomes more and more relaxed as each cloud passes by you
can feel yourself softening and letting go with each cloud moving through the
sky
enjoy this peaceful state for a little
longer noticing the beauty of the night
sky
[Music] now in your mind find the brightest star
in the sky and bring your attention to that star
only bring the brightest star in the sky
into full focus and allow the rest of
the background to blur slightly in your vision in this dream state continue to
focus your attention on the one brightest star in the sky
and now in your mind allow your gaze to
soften and invite your attention to
broaden to the bigger picture of the sky
where you are able to see all of the stars
in a moment I will guide you to count the stars above you beginning from 10
counting down to 1 and with each star
you count you will go deeper and deeper
into relaxation and into the comfortable
safe state of sleep and now begin to
count the stars in the sky to guide you into a deep sleep 10 you are deeply
relaxed you feel the tension melting away 9 you feel yourself completely
letting go of any responsibilities or
things you may need to do and you allow yourself to just be as you
drift off into a comfortable sleep eight

beginning to feel sleepy seven you
invite this blissful relaxed state to wash over you
[Music] six you can feel your body begin the
recovery and healing process that
accompanies deep sleep
five letting go completely every nerve
and muscle in your body is letting go to relax deeper and deeper
for drifting deeper sinking deeper into
the familiar heavy state of comfort
three almost to the deepest level of relaxation before you drift off to sleep
[Music]

breath you take brings you even deeper down into relaxation and one allow
yourself to go all the way into a deep state of relaxation experience a safe
heavy feeling of comfort [Music]

this time for yourself and it is helping your body recover and heal know that

stay with you overnight and will be
there with you when you wake up

energy that is restoring you healing you

feeling better and better

you take time to notice and feel gratitude for these small yet powerful
changes as you notice your physical body

almost as if you are floating and gravity has no effect on you you feel as
if you are a feather drifting on a breeze in the sky with this lightness
comes the letting go of anything weighing on you each aspect of your life

and this allows you to feel lighter physically as if a weight has been
lifted everything you let go of makes
room for the rejuvenation of a deep
