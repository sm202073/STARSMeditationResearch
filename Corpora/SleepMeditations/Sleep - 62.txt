hello and welcome to this guided meditation my name is Jason and over the
course of the next half hour or so we will journey into relaxation leaving
your thoughts and worries behind as you saw through the sky this is a meditation
about flying if you are uncomfortable with heights or nervous about the idea
of floating on the air don't worry as long as you listen to the sounds of this
meditation no harm can befall you you are entirely magnificently safe free to
drift with ease of any a great burden
with this in mind make sure you've found a comfortable position and when you are
ready settle in and let your eyes drift closed
take a moment to get back in touch with your breath how does it feel to inhabit
your body right now are there any areas that seem more tense
than usual can you let go of that pain
just for a little bit
and now turn your attention to your mind to the
constant dialog that accompanies you through your waking life
are there any sticking points in your thoughts or does your
stream-of-consciousness flow through your mind easily nothing left behind
if there is an issue a memory or a person who keeps cropping up ask
yourself if you can let go of it just for a little bit even the most pleasant
of thoughts and memories can cloud your meditation experience keep you from
focusing and enjoying the present moment
when you are ready turn your attention away from your body and your thoughts
and toward your breath let the oxygen
flow a little bit slower a little bit deeper
[Music] and as you breathe allow your conscious
mind to shut down and your imagination to awaken
your body sinks deeper into the chair or mattress as your imagination wakes up
bringing you visions of bright blue skies the sensation of flight
[Music]
imagine yourself standing up from your chair or bed wherever you might be right
now imagine yourself walking out of this
room all the way to the front door of your home or office
[Music]
as you stand outside on the sidewalk you take a giant leap into the air
as you do so you find the air support you hold you suspended on your next
inhale the wind catches you lifting you gently upward or quickly or as slowly as
you would like you are flying in control
of the direction and the speed of your path take a moment to experiment with
your newfound ability dipping and twirling through the air as the wind
tickles your cheese

far below you the ground looks like thousands of tiny rugs all laid together
pinpricks of light spill across the landscape like glitter punctuated every
so often by the fluffy green of a stand of trees lakes and rivers squiggle
through the dusty plains and grassy Dells houses are sorted neatly into
little rectangular yards divided up by narrow ribbons of gray pavements highway
and interstate roadways meander around sharp mountain peaks the vehicles
traveling along them with tiny flakes of color
even the most chaotic sides where the construction projects or road work are
neatly organized from above everything has a pattern articulated through swoops
and grids and arcs visible only from the air if you would like now you can take
some moments to examine them more closely or you can simply let go and
enjoy the experience of flight [Music]

the air supports you boys you up carries
you along on it's warm currents you can feel the resistance against your arms a
sensory knowledge that tells you exactly how sharply you can turn how deeply you
can dive how quickly you can stop midair
your body understands how to dip and twirl how to saw or slow down without
your mind and necessarily knowing what must happen you are fearless carried by
the knowledge that your muscles know exactly what to do with this in mind
allow yourself to soar to dive to Bank
against the wind allowing the sensations of flying to leave daily worries and
stress far behind you you are as magnificent as an eagle as
strong as wise as utterly in control as
a majestic bird of prey enjoy it

as you saw along you encounter a flock of birds
perhaps geese or songbirds on their migration somewhere following invisible
ancestral flight plans through the clouds if you would like you can fly
with them for a bit body instantly attuned to the way the air washes across
their wings over their backs bearing them effortlessly along the wind you can
speak with them enjoy their chatter or savor the silence
and whenever you want you can bank with the wind off in another direction
swooping low over mountain canyons and desert flowers feel the air temperature
change your speed increase and decrease all with the easy confidence that your
abilities bring [Music]
there are some rain clouds off to one side if you would like you can fly through
them feeling the cool rain on your back and face as you dance with the raindrops
as you spin through the air gracefully entirely in control oh you
could fly to where the Sun is just rising feeling the warmth of the morning
creep over the horizon watching it gild the clouds with a heavenly light
anything is within your reach here high above the earth here amongst the clouds
you are completely safe and entirely in control your every moment as graceful as
a ballet dancers [Music]

and now allow yourself to hear the call
of your physical body the beckoning of the place where you began this
meditation there is no rush to return
instead let yourself frolic amongst the clouds dip between the travelling
currents of air savor the grace and power within your body enjoy the
tranquility within your mind watch the world below noting its geometrical
rhythms the colors melting into one another

give yourself a few moments to find your home or office amongst the neatly organized buildings
below you and when you are ready begin
your gradual descent allow yourself to
circle savoring the rush of air against your arms that particular pressure that
assures you that you know exactly how to fly you move more slowly more
confidently the lower you get at first
the sites below you grow gradually larger sinks slowly down to the ground
outside your home or office [Music]
with a deep breath you open the front door move inside head back to whatever
room you began this meditation in when you arrive you see your physical body
calm relaxed resting
take a moment remember the sensations of flying and
when you are ready reach out your hand to touch your physical presence and feel
yourself re inhabit your body when you
are ready allow your eyes to open this
meditation is drawing to a close and you are back amongst us just as majestic and
graceful as when you were soaring amongst the clouds
