hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation that
will help you to find peace and inner tranquility before you naturally fall
into a deep and restorative sleep
short while you'll be guided to relax the body and ease the mind before being
led through a visual journey into a mystical cave of peace it's your time to
allow yourself to be carried away gently through this journey knowing that you
are entirely supported in this present moment so take a moment now to ensure
that all end of day activities have been wrapped up alarms should be set and
liens drawn I invite you now to come
into a comfortable lying down position ensuring that your body is resting with
ease wherever you are you might want to use blankets or cushions to support you
as you find comfort in the physical space you occupy [Music]
take a few releasing breaths here allowing a deep sigh to leave your body
on your next outward breath [Music]
to begin our journey into tranquility take a moment to observe the stillness
of your physical body as dei transforms
into night and the Sun fades away we are invited to enter a much needed period of
rest and rejuvenation as we sink into the stillness of night rest assured
there is nothing we need to consciously engage in or take care of we can trust
that the body will work by its way of its innate wisdom so take a moment now
to quietly observe the miracle of this body
[Music] feel into its heaviness as you sink
further into the surface beneath you
you might want to notice now where there might still be movement despite the
sense of stillness notice where breath brings subtle
movement to the body how it causes the chest and stomach to expand on each
inhalation and to fall away on each
exhalation [Music]
observe how beautifully this gentle movement intertwines with a deeper sense
of complete stillness as you take a few deep breaths here in silence
[Music]
if thoughts arise in the mind no that is entirely natural for them to do so as
you become aware that your attention has shifted into stories about the past or
future simply acknowledge these thoughts from a more distant place than his habit
or [Music]
while the mind can be useful at times it can lure us into a unproductive thought
cycles when left to run on its own terms
as we begin to witness our mental movements from a higher or broader
vantage point we practice our power of discernment easing challenging thoughts
and emotions as we experience greater clarity and a sense of peace
[Music]
as you journey through this meditation keep this sense of distance in mind as
thought arises and returned to your breath as an anchor when needed
[Music]
move now further into breath awareness as you practice holding your attention
on this anchor that is always available to you [Music]
notice the breaths wither its pace and
its depth as you move alongside it in both directions
[Music] hold for a brief pause just a second or
two and at the end of each inhalation and each exhalation finding brief
moments of complete stillness within each breath cycle
[Music]
allow the mind to gently subside as you become more attuned to the present
moment attachment to worried anxious or
distracting thoughts can be released as you practice being the observer of
whatever is moving through you just
allow yourself to sink further and further into this very moment
entering naturally into a state of full-bodied ease and tranquility
[Music]
with your eyes remaining closed tune into this space between the eyebrows
just in front of your mind's eye [Music]
envision in this space of vast emptiness something like a clear night sky
[Music] sink into this infinite abyss of space
and silence for a few moments as you prepare to enter into a cave of complete
peace and tranquility [Music]
as you gaze with eyes closed into the empty sky in front of you and vision
your view dotted with infinite sparkling stars you are in an open outdoor space
surrounded by the open air lakes rivers and mountains the moon is high and full
[Music]
tune into your breath for a few moments noticing the freshness of the air that
fills you [Music]
just follow my voice for a few breaths here as you inhale deeply breathing in a
sense of being completely at ease and exhale slowly releasing any tension or
stress in body or mind inhaling again
visualizing yourself filling up with peace and ease and exhale fully
releasing anything that no longer serves your movement towards complete
relaxation
breathing deeply once more filling yourself with the freedom and freshness
of outdoor air and exhale completely
releasing all tension to be transformed by the starlit sky
[Music]
returned gently to your natural breath allowing your mind to refocus on the
empty space in front of your mind's eye [Music]
though night has fallen upon this outdoor landscape the land is lit by
stars and moonlight granting you with
enough light to see the curves of the earth take a moment now to simply
observe the way the rocky mountain faced peaks and Falls and the way rivers and
lakes gently caressed the hard surface of the earth notice how peaceful it is
here beneath the night sky as you feel yourself coming into complete harmony
with the natural world
from where you stand you see an empty cavern not too far away illuminated by
the full moon above its spaciousness its
emptiness cause you towards it so you
begin to walk slowly and mindfully towards the sheltered space within the
mountain [Music]
notice the way your feet effortlessly move across the earth you feel
completely at home in this natural landscape as you move towards the cave
that beckons you quietly [Music]
as you reach the opening to this wondrous cave your original sense that
it rests unoccupied is confirmed there
is no one here but you know plant life inside and no animals the only thing
that you have yet to sense within this cave is a deep stillness it is
completely silent and yet something about it is calling to you in the
faintest whisper recognizable only by your heart
[Music]
by the entrance of the cave there is a candle placed here by some universal
force for whoever might come to rest here you light the candle with a match
that has also been provided and quietly make your way inside the dark cavern
fear anxiety and worry are completely absent all that is present within you is
a growing calmness [Music]
he reached the center of this mystical cave that has called you into it setting
your candle in the center and bringing yourself to rest comfortably on the
floor lying on your back you stare up at
the ceiling noticing the incredible edges carved by nature breathing deeply
and feel entirely at peace in this open and empty space
[Music]
silence surrounds you as the mind rests in a deep state of peace and tranquility
your breath continues to flow through you effortlessly and gracefully
[Music]
yet within this vast silence something in this cave is speaking to you the mind
cannot decipher it but the heart knows that there is a great wisdom radiating
out from these walls you listen more intently to this language still foreign
to the mind and find that your heart begins to open up the serenity of this
space softens your heart as a deep trust infiltrates your entire being in this
serene state you find a calm and the quiet sense of courage to ask this cave
any questions that might arise from your purest heart
[Music]
as you allow your heart to ask these wise walls any questions that arise you
find that the questions themselves are infused with trust rather than with fear
and anxiety your heart speaks calmly and quietly the mind resting peacefully in
the background and as you listen closely
with your heart remaining open you find that the walls speak back in silent
whispers gently wisely and compassionately this is the language of
the heart and you open yourself to it completely [Music]
you do not have to search for any answers you trust that they will come in
their own time patience and peace arise
within you [Music]
the cave sends its wisdom in the form of whispers visions and inner sensations
though not all at once this mystical cave knows that some
answers require extra time to be revealed and that when the time is right
the answers will be provided you open
your heart even wider sinking further into the peaceful and serene energy of
this cave spend a few more silent moments listening to the wisdom of the
wars that surround you the mind remains quiet as the heart remains receptive
[Music]
coming now to a deeply settled state you turn your head to blow out the candle
that is beside you your mind is calm your heart is warm and your spirit is
nourished notice a deep trust arising
within you a completely calm presence radiates throughout your entire being
all at once there is no separation between you and this mystical cave an
overwhelming sense of oneness comes over you
as you sink further and further into
this deep tranquility of darkness your body returns to the physical reality of
the room that you rest in witness the
surface now your body rests on observing quietly all the tangible items
supporting you here and now [Music]
feel into this supremely calm state allowing your breath to rock you closer
and closer towards sleep all images melt
away from the heart and mind as you come back to a place of deep physical
presence notice the air around your body
the warmth of blankets and cushions the heaviness of your limbs your torso your
head and the rest of your body
[Music]
each breath travels deeply into your lungs transporting vital life energy to
every cell of your body you can rest
with ease knowing that as you sleep this process is being taken care of by the
bodies and Nate wisdom there is nothing
else for you to do nothing else for you to ask think believe or create all that
the heart yearns for now is this deep sense of peace and contentment to carry
you into a peaceful night's sleep as you
breathe your conscious awareness begins to melt away asleep comes to restore
your entire being [Music]
continue to follow the breath quietly and effortlessly until everything slips
away soon you will enter into a peaceful
slumber where the caves mystical energies will replenish you entirely
mind body and heart
