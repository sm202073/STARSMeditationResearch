you you
hello this is Sara Raymond and welcome to this guided meditation focused on
complete body and mind relaxation to guide you into a deep sleep if you would
like or if you are not ready to sleep you will be deeply relaxed thank you so
much for joining me today before we get started make sure you are ready to drift
off to sleep when this recording is over if you like the relaxing benefits of
lavender oil and happen to have some you can rub some on your temples and your
pulse points take a moment now to turn
off all distractions and pause this recording if there's
anything you need to do to prepare yourself for safe and comfortable night
sleep know that you are safe and
supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you
choose to do so
as we begin allow your eyes to close gently
and focus your attention on your breath
imagine the air you are breathing in as a warm glowing light that fills you
up and heals you from the inside hold
your breath for just a moment allowing this light to go deep down into your
belly and then let out that breath
gently allowing any physical and emotional attention to leave your body
with your exhale again take another deep breath hold it
for a short moment and this time
take your time with the exhale slowing it down
take the next few moments to breathe in this way for three more cycles of breath
each cycle allow the exhale to slow down a little more than the breath before it
and feel your body soften and your thoughts slow down even more with each
passing breath
now releasing that breath pattern and allowing your breath to return to
its natural rhythm and
notice how you are feeling how you're focused breathing pattern has slowed
your heart rate is quiet in your mind
it has brought about a heavy sense of calm to your physical body
with each breath in bring a sense of relaxation into your body and with each
breath out breathe out tension
being fully present to this moment to your physical body to the sounds around
you and to the surface below you
set the intention for peace and relaxation for your physical body
and for you mentally and spiritually
for today open your heart and your mind to the opportunity the state of comfort
and mindfulness offers for healing your body know that you are safe and fully
supported to release stress and improve
your health and well-being as you sleep deeply for the night
you take another slow breath in making it
your deepest breath yet
and as you release that breath feel that the tension in your body has begun to
loosen and subside feel that your body
is becoming heavy and calm
take a moment to be fully present with the physical sensations of your body
right now let go of distractions let go of your
responsibilities let go of expectations
of what you might think this experience should be and simply surrender to the
process of relaxation
notice what you are feeling without changing or judging
just notice
you might feel a light tingling sensation in the palms or a floating
sensation in your body that comes and goes or you may feel a comforting heaviness
throughout your body you may begin to notice it feels as if
there is no difference between where your body ends and where the surface
below you begins whatever you're feeling
is perfect and you just observe the
feelings and sensations as you allow yourself to enjoy this journey allow
yourself to turn the whole world off and to go within with my voice as a guide to
deep sleep
in a moment now I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting
from the top of your head going all the way through your body to your feet as
you see each part of your body in your mind's eye you will relax that body part
completely and as you move your
attention throughout the body you will scan for any areas of tension
tightness or pain if there are areas of
tension you will stay on that part of your body for a moment and breathe in
the warm healing light right into that area to soften it
you will ask your body to relax and release and this warm loving light will
melt the tension away from your body and allow you to fully relax
as you continue scanning your body you will feel this relaxing and healing
energy move through you as it takes you deeper and deeper into a safe and
supported state of sleep and recovery
as this light passes over your body it progressively relaxed as you and
releases each muscle small and large
and now let's begin the slow process of relaxing the entire body to prepare for
a deep and productive sleep for the night
now begin to ask for release from your scalp and head
and feel your forehead soften and smooth
the tiny muscles around your eyebrows
melt and you can allow the tension from the
day to dissolve from your face
peel your eyelids becoming very heavy
part your teeth unclench your jaw and relax your tongue
this softening of your faith and Jah will deepen the relaxation of your
entire body
you can now feel your throat softening
and you notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to
relax deeper and deeper
allowing this wave of comfort to continue its journey down your body
you feel your chest and shoulders release and rest heavy
every breath in brings healing air into
your belly and allows the abdomen to let go even further and now allow both arms
to relax and feel as all of the tension from your
upper body flows out through your fingertips
and as you continue to breathe in fresh healing oxygen into your chest and
abdomen your body is able to use this oxygen to recover and repair from your
activities of daily life
and now inviting the relaxation to continue its path down your body into
your hips and lower back
linger on this area a little longer and ask your body for a sense of ease
let go of all the tension held in this area
feel your body softening as each in-breath creates space for an easy flow
of energy through your body
this comfort moves into both of your legs
washing relaxation over your thighs your knees and your calves and you feel any
remaining tension tightness or pain flush out of your body through the
bottoms of your feet so that you are completely relaxed throughout your
entire body know that your relaxed body
will allow for a productive recovery while you sleep so you all wake feeling
refreshed and rejuvenated after a good
night's sleep you are now deeply relaxed and you can
begin to use your imagination to visualize yourself from the outside as
if you are an observer looking down at yourself
lying in your bed and your very own room I will guide you on a journey taking you
into a dream state and you can simply follow my voice or drift off to sleep
whenever you are ready
see yourself right where you are in your own bed in your own room
but imagine now that your room has a moonroof just like a car it's able to
slide open with the push of a button
in your mind see as your ceiling begins
to slowly open right above your bed so
that it begins to reveal the open night sky directly above you
you are still nice and cozy in your bed
completely safe and supported and now
you can look up into the night sky and
see all of the many stars shining bright
you can see the moon lit up above you and the clouds passing by as each cloud
passes by you notice the thoughts in
your head going along with them
and your body becomes more and more relaxed as each one passes by you can
feel all of the tension from the day leaving your body and your mind with
each cloud as well and now find the
brightest star in the sky and bring your
attention to that star only bring this
brightest star in the sky into full focus and allow the rest of the
background to blur slightly in your vision in this dream state
continue for the next few moments to focus your attention on the one
brightest star in the sky
you
in your mind allow your gaze to soften
and your attention can now brought in to the bigger picture of the sky with all
of the stars in it and in a moment I
will guide you to count the stars above you beginning from 10 counting down to 1
and with each star you count
you will get deeper and deeper into relaxation and into the comfortable
state of sleep
