hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation as you
prepare for a deep and nourishing sleep this meditation will guide you into
manifesting a beautiful and loving relationship of your highest dreams one
that is in alignment with your truest self the relationship that you come to
manifest will be aligned with your own unique needs and personal journey
perhaps it is a romantic partner you are currently attracting or a deeper
friendship of some other form regardless
of what your heart most deeply yearns for this meditation will help you to
manifest that relationship upon a foundation of trust allowing you to rest
easy and sing into a deep and enriching
sleep [Music]
so before we begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable
using any desired cushions or blankets for support and warmth and adjust your
body so that it rests comfortably allow
the body to move itself so that any physical or tension or tightness can
begin the process of release so just
prepare yourself and your environment in any way necessary so that this day may
be left behind set any alarms now and
turn off all lights if your mind and body a moment to sink into this place
and time exactly as it is knowing that
there is nothing more to do or to be taken care of
[Music] now take a moment to connect with your
breath without trying to change it or
manipulate it in any way I invite you to simply become aware of
its natural flow our breath carries an
innate wisdom of its own and does not need to be altered in any way while it
is sometimes beneficial to deepen or direct the breath in certain manners for
right now I invite you to simply be very present with the natural state of your
being [Music]
there may be aspects of the day that linger in your mind or there may be
thoughts about tomorrow if any of these
sorts of thoughts exist within you simply witness them acknowledging that
they are not required in this very moment remind yourself that there is
nothing to be done here and now all that
is required of you is deep presence with your breath and with this moment
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
draw your attention now to the hard space as you breathe allow the heart to
gently expand with each inhalation and gently soften with each exhalation
take a few silent breaths here from your heart center as you begin to soften its
walls and open to the endless possibilities of love and deep
connection love is abundant its presence
is everywhere and as you sink further into this meditation you will begin to
touch the truth that love exists all around and within each of us
[Music]
you are invited now to cultivate an awareness of and an appreciation for
your innate radiance beauty and divinity
[Music] in order to manifest and outer love it
is necessary to first acknowledge the inner one complete and perfect in and of
itself if any thoughts arise attempting
to intervene with your experience of self-love simply witness them and then
allow these thoughts to gently melt away as swiftly as they came
[Music]
take a few moments right now to gently introduce the words I am made of love I
am made of love I am made of love just
allow these words to flow into the heart space with each breath allow them to
soften the heart further dissolving any preconceived notions that may stand in
their way [Music]
it may not come easily to self love it
may trigger a rising resistance and know
that if this is the case this too is okay know that any resistance does not
make the truth of your innate beauty and radiance less valid resistance that
arises is simply born of prior conditioning that has led us to forget
the truth that we are in fact made of
love love runs through each of our cells and
as we become more aware of its presence within us we are able to attract more of
it from the outer world so take a few
more moments to allow these words to permeate your being I am made of love I
am made of love I am made of love
[Music] if any emotions arise know that this is
entirely okay allow these emotions to
free you allow them to melt away taking
limiting notions along with them as they disobeyed emotions are often tired with
words and stories if stories emerge in
the mind simply acknowledge them without
allowing them to attach themselves to you you are made of love any wording or
stories that contradict this truth is not born of your truest nature so take
three more deep breaths with these words held in mind and heart I am made of love
I am made of love I am made of love
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] bring your awareness back to the heart
space now continually allowing this
space within you to expand and soften with each full breath each breath
through the heart cleanses and nourishes your being freeing up constricted energy
that no longer serves your highest purpose and your dreams as you breathe
releasing unloving notions and embracing the truth of who you are begin to feel
the heart expanding beyond the chest as
its walls soften you find that the heart
begins to touch the outside world with a deep awareness for the unlimited and
unbounded nature of love you might like
to envision a white light expanding from the heart reaching to touch each area of
the body and beyond [Music]
your entire being is bathed in this white loving light as all motions in
contradiction to love melt away you are
whole and complete here love radiates
from your being [Music]
[Music]
[Music] as you sink further into this state of
relaxation allow your highest mind to
conjure up visions of qualities you were deeply attracted to in a person
[Music] as you rest in the awareness that you
are currently complete and whole as you are you begin to consider what type of
person you wish to share your life with with that person be a romantic partner
friend or soul made of some other form
allow your fullest heart to direct you through this inner exploration continue
to explore what qualities am i deeply
attracted to in a person [Music]
[Music]
you take your time here becoming aware of
how the past may attempt to interfere with what type of qualities and type of
person you envision allow any beliefs
not rooted in love to melt away allow
the heart to guide your highest mind to create a feeling of what this manifested
soulmate ignites within you
what feelings does your sole lover or friend bring to you what qualities
invite a further expansion of the heart [Music]
what type of person do you wish to share the fullness of your being with just
take a few moments to rest here as you
continue to breathe through the hard space allowing the feeling of this
person to come to you you may construct and deconstruct as much as necessary
moving closer and closer to your most
authentic self allow your most heart
centered feelings to create an image in your mind of what this person is like
[Music]
whatever your soul calls for is a reflection of your highest self and
fullest heart allow the soul to guide
your loving imagination as you manifest this beautiful and loving relationship
[Music] trust that the universe is supporting
your journey with each breath you take
with each expansion and softening of the heart the universe moves through you you
are coming closer and closer to manifesting in the physical reality the
love that is desired by your highest self
[Music] come back to the breath now for a few
moments of silence as you melt into this present moment with complete trust and
faith that your soul is manifesting a
love of your truest dreams there is
nothing you need to chase and nothing you need to do simply allow your highest
mind and heart to conspire in creating the love of your dreams what you seek is
seeking you allow it to come naturally
into both the mental emotional and physical realms there is no need to
control or to chase simply allow your
highest self to guide you
[Music]
[Music]
love is not limited to romance love is
irrelevant to physical intimacy wherever you are right now you are manifesting a
love that is in accordance with your deepest needs at present love may show up as a true
friend a family member a new connection
or an old one a human or a pet there is
no limit to love there is no limit to
the type of love we are capable of manifesting whatever your sole cause for
is your truest desire simply take a
moment here to rest in whatever form of love your heart and soul are calling for
[Music]
take a few deep breaths here in tin ually coming back to the innate beauty
and support of the heart
as you rest in stillness and deep relaxation gently introduce the
affirmation I am attracting a loving

holding on to tension or resistance just

on each inhalation and softening any
residing resistance on each exhalation

image of love that you have created take a few breaths to relish in this deep and
beautiful love that you are envisioning that you are currently manifesting born
from a place of inner completeness you are attracting a beautiful deep and
loving relationship whatever type of

wholeheartedly invited into your realm of being there is nothing you need to
actively do now you are free to rest into a deep trust and knowing that love

highest dreams allow yourself to sink
further into this knowing the love that
