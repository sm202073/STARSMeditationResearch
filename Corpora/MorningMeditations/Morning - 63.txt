[Music]
i'm glad you are joining me today
for this guided mindfulness meditation
on loneliness
and feeling alone
[Music]
as we begin this session
find a comfortable seated position
where you can gradually
let go
of the tightness
and all the muscles
throughout your body
allow yourself
to breathe naturally
and comfortably
and begin
settling into a state
of relaxed
and present
awareness
[Music]
in this meditation session
we will focus on finding a deep sense of
peace
within ourselves
even
when we may be missing
a person
group of people
or a pet who we wish
was there
to be with us
and provide comfort
in our most
vulnerable times
[Music]
it is also possible to feel lonely and
isolated
even when there are many people
in our lives
or
we may be missing
someone who we've lost
in either the recent or distant past
meditating on this
will help us to recognize
that feelings of loneliness
is a natural occurrence
but if we practice mindfulness
it will help us to be more present
and at peace in each moment
better able to cope with whatever
situation we find ourselves in
[Music]
as you continue to get settled in
keep your attention on your natural
breathing
[Music]
gently in
and out
[Music]
and now that you are here in this place
of presence
remain loose
and relaxed throughout your entire body
focused and present in mind
as you hear my words
[Music]
i ask you
to imagine a place or an event
from the past
this could be from your childhood
or recent memory
it might be an activity with friends or
family
maybe a memory from a special moment in
your life
it might be
from somewhere with a pet
or just a favorite place
to get away
and let your mind drift off
and instead if you like you can also
create your own imagined place
maybe a relaxing beachfront
or a forest path
or floating in the clouds
or
among the stars
in space
bright
warm
serene
visualize the space and
if you like
take a deep breath in
and out
let your mind deeply transport you to
this place
visualize what is happening all around
you
[Music]
allow yourself
to feel even more relaxed than you were
even just a few moments ago
and now i'll ask you to do one more
deep breath
in this calming space
in
and out
[Music]
and as you are here
perfectly content
in this space
in need of nothing more
[Music]
we will just take one minute
of silent meditation and contemplation
starting now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
great
by keeping this place of peace in your
mind
remember that you can transport yourself
back here at any time
whenever you might be feeling isolated
or lacking a connection with people
as a reminder
meditation alone
will not completely fill our need for
human connection
but it can bring us reassurance and
peace
in the moments when we need it
and may not have someone to immediately
turn to
we can clear our mind
relax our bodies
and then
decide
and find the next steps to seeking
companionship
love
and connection
as we finish today's session
i will leave you with five short phrases
i encourage you to use these
even write them down
and keep them handy when you do short
meditations throughout your day
and visualize your imagined place
you can do this anytime
so feel free to repeat
these five short phrases after me
if you wish
beginning with
[Music]
finding my place of peace
present
and
aware
[Music]
i am calm
within myself
i am connected
to the universe
[Music]
i
am not alone
[Music]
fantastic job today
to seek further help with loneliness and
feelings of being alone
don't hesitate to utilize the resources
that i provide in the video description
and of course feel free to leave a
comment
and share your own experience
nobody should be alone in this world
and there are ways to make those
connections
for right now
use this meditation practice
to find that peace and presence
within this very moment
within yourself
and the pathway forward will become more
clear
we will finish with several minutes of
peaceful
ambient music continuing
thank you again for joining me
and goodbye
for now
