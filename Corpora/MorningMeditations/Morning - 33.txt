setting an intention
to come into this present moment
seated comfortably wherever you are
take a deep breath in and as you exhale
allow yourself to close your eyes
and let go
let go into this internal awareness
of peace and love
inhale and
exhale
thank yourself for showing up today
for making room in your day for your
peace
and well-being and if you're joining me
as part of the 14-day mindfulness
journey
welcome to day four
our mindful practice today will be all
about letting go of energy
thoughts and emotions that are no longer
serving us
and our greater potential
so let yourself settle in in this moment
allowing your eyes to feel heavy
your face relaxed
feel your shoulders drop away from your
ears
[Music]
let it go find
stillness
feel yourself grounded balanced
becoming enveloped by a beautiful
sensation
of peace and love
[Music]
big breath in
and let it go
[Music]
in the hindu religion exist a
mythological
mystical goddess of death and
destruction
she is known as goddess kali
goddess kali thrives and lives off of
our insecurities
and impurities she fuels off this
negative energy
that can be within us and she willingly
wants to take it from us
if we truly offer it to her from the
depths of our hearts
it can be the energy of anger fear
jealousy frustration it can be anything
and everything that is holding us back
and walking towards a clear path of love
forgiveness and peace
so as you take this opportunity right
now to go into a deeper stillness
let's focus our heart on invoking this
energy
of this incredible goddess kali
bringing awareness to the energy within
ourselves
that we feel is no longer serving our
greatest potential and well-being
offer all the things that lower your
vibration
take it out of the flow of the universe
and offer them to kali
who eats who lives off all these
impurities you can offer her
release it out of your body
your mind and your soul
here kali take my anger
[Music]
here kali take my pain
take my frustration take it
as i don't want it anymore
offer it from your heart release it out
of your body
give it away feeling the heaviness
the weight slowly drop away from your
shoulders
let it go
breathe it out
release it to her to goddess kali
give it away to this powerful force of
the universe
stay in the stillness
[Music]
and as you surrender this negative
energy your emotions
that are within you feel free to repeat
the following mantra
to assist you in staying in this present
moment
i let go of all that no longer serves me
i let go of all
that no longer serves me
[Music]
now stay in this presence repeating this
mantra
silently in your mind as you let go
and release

feeling right now

like

that you have created in your heart
which can now you can welcome love
