This is a 10 minute guided meditation session
with positive thinking affirmations.
Give this brief session a try
and see if it helps you to feel more calm,
peaceful, and at ease.
It will be a relaxing and rejuvenating
10 minutes out of your day or night.
Simply sit comfortably
and focus on your natural breathing in and out
As we do these affirmations
just feel that gentle movement of your chest
and that airflow
Again, Naturally
in and out.
When I say each affirmation,
feel free to either silently reflect on it...
repeat it out loud...
or just repeat it in your head.
During these affirmations,
I invite you to just enjoy this time.
We will begin 10 affirmations...
now.
I choose to have a positive mindset
I trust and believe in myself
I will surround myself with love
I am grateful for all the good in my life
I choose to see the best in others and myself
I am open to new opportunities and possibilities
I can handle any challenge that comes my way
I will achieve my goals and aspirations
I will attract positive energy into my life
I choose to live in the present moment and enjoy it
Great job!
This ends this set of affirmations.
Now, we will shorten these affirmations
and go through them one more time.
Just continue to enjoy this comfort and peace that you have created.
As you hear or repeat each shortened affirmation again...
Feel it twice as deeply
and let it radiate within you.
We will begin the shortened affirmations...
now
Choosing a positive mindset
Belief in myself
Surrounding myself with love
Grateful for goodness
Seeing the best in everyone
Open to what is new
Able to handle any challenge
Achieving my goals
Attracting positive energy
Enjoying the present moment
Awesome.
This concludes the affirmations.
Please feel free to take a few more minutes
to embrace this calm and peaceful time
of ambient music and meditation.
The music will very slowly fade
and the meditation will conclude shortly.
At that time, feel free to slowly open your eyes
if you have them closed,
and your session will be complete.
My spoken portion will end...
