This is a guided mindfulness  meditation on living for today.
Feel free to find a comfortable place to sit,
and just find your own calming  space to be in for a little while.
And as you get comfortable,
just bring your focus to your breathing,
in and out.
Just gently and naturally.
Allow yourself to feel a  sense of calm wash over you.
Right here in your place.
Here in your time.
And I'll just do a slow countdown now,
continuing to focus
on that gentle natural and relaxed breath.
Counting now:
Five.
Four
Three.
Two.
One.
And as you deeply feel this calm and presence,
I invite you to imagine your childhood.
Think of a feeling like when you would
play outside with friends.
Fun, free, excited.
As we grow up, we know that  our lives become busier,
more responsibilities,
more expectations.
More stress to weigh us down.
We may long for that  childhood-like wonder of youth.
As we can so often fall into the  trap of worrying about the future
and dwelling on the past.
With so much to do,
we may feel that there is no time  to live in the present moment.
But of course,
this is the trick of the mind that  so easily allows us to get lost.
But knowing the path back to the present moment
can allow us to become found again.
We have within each of us  the ability to live for today
right here and now.
Enjoying and taking in each moment.
Grateful and willing to embrace  this time in this place.
And, in learning this,
we can realize that this  moment, right here and now,
is truly all we ever have.
And it is truly beautiful to  be right here, each moment.
And therefore,
we can practice and learn the  true meaning of living for today.
It is the ability to maintain a  balance of our responsibilities,
while still always recognizing  and living right here in the now.
It's also reminding ourselves
to bring ourselves back, should we get  lost, distracted, fearful, or overwhelmed.
And so, now,
we will deepen our thoughts  of presence and mindfulness
of living for today
by doing some short affirmations.
And so if you like, you can repeat these,
either out loud or in your head.
As I remind you to continue sitting comfortably,
breathing naturally
with that breath focus.
We will start now.
"In this moment."
"I feel presence and peace."
"In this moment."
"I feel childlike wonder."
"In this moment."
"Content and grateful."
"In this moment."
"Living for each day."
Great.
And now we will do the same exercise,
but this time, focusing on the days to come.
So we will start again, now.
"Each day, I will remember."
"Presence and peace."
"Each day, I will embrace."
"Childlike wonder."
"Each day, I will be.
"Content and grateful."
"Each day, I will live."
"A rich and joyful life."
Very nice.
Even through challenges,
we can embrace and live a rich and joyful life.
Keep this in your mind and in your heart.
Remember to be present and free,
just as you would as a child,
running outside, without a care in the world.
As a child, you didn't need to strive for it.
The process of letting go of all of  that baggage of the mind just happened.
And it can happen to you again.
Feel this deeply within you,
and come back to these ideas  any day or time that you like.
Whenever you need a reminder.
Remembering each moment.
Present, peaceful, grateful, joyful.
Living for today.
Now you can continue with  silent meditation if you wish,
for a while longer.
So now,
I'll just count down with you once more,
starting with:
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
