Welcome to mediation for peace and positivity
The focus of our mediation today will be on
letting go of all that no longer serves purpose
any worries or stress you might be feeling within you
and making room to welcome positive
loving energy
Bringing your awareness to this negative energy
and then consciously making a choice
to let it go
once negative energy or thoughts
enter our mind the ego lusts to swim in it
dissect it or dwell upon it
the reality is whatever happens, happened
and it is now in the past
once a particular situation or moment has occurred in our lives
and we feel like we've done everything we could possibly do
to fix it or deal with it, we must find
the strength within us to shake it out
and mentally walk away.
to not allow the negativity
to continue to effect us mentally and physically
instead consciously change our thought
patterns
with awareness by welcoming positive
thoughts we will slowly start to diffuse the
negativity and it is truly incredible
to witness this shift
which can almost happen instantly at times
bringing love, gratitude
and positivity will heal your mind
of negative thought patterns
we are in control of our thoughts
and we can obtain the power to be able to
decide how much you're willing to allow them to affect us
so in this moment right now
together, let's decide to
let go of anything that may be bothering us
or not allowing us to find peace in our minds
making a conscious decision to
release it like releasing a rock into the ocean
watching it slowly sink
lower and lower
until it is completely out of sight
lets use this moment to change the frequency
of our thoughts
welcoming more love, positivity
and gratitude
with this idea in mind
lets get comfortable to begin our meditation together
sitting in a comfortable position
either on the floor or on your bed or against the wall
lets start by closing your eyes
bringing all of your awareness
to your breath
taking a deep breath in
and a long exhale out
and again just taking a deep breath in
and exhale
bringing yourself and your awareness
to the very present moment
feeling the ground underneath you
allowing yourself to completely let go
and release

take another deep breath in
and exhale out
as you inhale
feeling the coolness of the air coming into your nose

and then as you exhale
become aware of the warmth
of the air leaving your mouth or nose
just bring all of your awareness those sensations

inhale
and exhale
bring your awareness to your face
lets release ant tension out of your forehead
and then slowly making your way down
to your eyes
allowing the eyes to feel heavy
keeping them closed as your focus on the breathing
relax your jaw
let go of any tension
feeling your tongue gently resting in your mouth
inhale
and exhale
bring your awareness to your heart
feel the rhythm of it
keeping you alive and healthy
just focusing on the heartbeat
deep breath into your nose
and exhale out
bring the energy of gratitude into your heart
feel grateful for being alive
for being well
feeling grateful for all the wonderful things in your life
that make you smile everyday no matter
how little they are
just allow that feeling of happiness
and gratitude fill your heart
and fill the rest of your body
inhale
and exhale
as you begin to move deeper into this relaxed state
lets introduce our mantra
love
peace and joy
surrounds me every day
love, peace and joy
surrounds me everyday
as you repeat this mantra
allow the warm feeling of whatever it is that brings you happiness
fill your mind and body
allow the feeling of gratitude to
dissolve any worries or stressful thoughts
that may have been bothering you
bring yourself to this moment
being present and completely relaxed
safe and at peace
with everything that surrounds you
love, peace
and joy surrounds me everyday
love, peace, and joy surrounds me everyday
and now silently in your mind
allowing yourself to sink deeper into
the awareness of love and peace
within you
time to release the mantra
slowly bring your awareness to your breath
taking a deep breath in
exhale out
if you wish you can slowly start to move each finger
each toe
and whenever you're ready
you may open your eyes
feel free to stay longer in this state of being if you wish
allowing yourself to feel truly peaceful and at ease
bringing more positive frequencies into your mind and body
through welcoming gratitude and love into your life
appreciation and gratitude is
such an important part of our mental wellbeing
not only in diffusing negativity
but also in attracting more loving and positive energy into your life
so as your go on about your day
pay attention to those little things that make you smile
that make you feel truly lucky to be alive
those are the moments we must keep scared
in our hearts
thank you guys so much
for joining me on this beautiful mediation together
may you have a beautiful and joyous day
and i can't wait to see you again
love and light
