hey guys welcome to meditation day 8
im so happy that you've taken this time out of your day
and dedicating it to yourself and your wellbeing
todays meditation will be confused on
manifesting your dreams
every single one of us has a different goal and dream
and the beauty of it all is that
our thoughts play avery important part
our words are very powerful
vibrations that we put out into the universe
reflect the outcome
we almost always end up attracting
ask yourself
what are your dreams
what do you aspire to achieve
sometimes we hide from our dreams
because they're too scrary
to admit to ourselves
and our fear of failure makes avoiding them
very easy
I'm asking you that for the next ten minutes
simply face them embrace them
and give them the attention they deserve.
everything is energy
you and me have energy within us
and so do our thoughts
so if we truly begin to
to reprogram the way we think
talk and express ourselves
we can begin to make incredible changes
that will attract great success
abundance and true
joy into our lives
