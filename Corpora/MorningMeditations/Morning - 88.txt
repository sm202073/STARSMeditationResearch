this
is a guided mindfulness meditation
uncalming the mind
[Music]
take this bit of time for you
[Music]
just to be here and present
in the moment seeking a calm
and still mind
find a comfortable position for yourself
you may choose to remain seated upright
in a chair
or sit cross-legged on the ground
[Music]
it may help to open up your chest by
gently
and slightly bringing your shoulders
back
in this session we will learn to find a
still mind
and be here in the now
begin to turn your attention to your
breathing
bring your focus to this moment
by recognizing the movement of your
chest
or the air movement in and out of your
nostrils
just allow yourself to breathe normally
and naturally in
and out
but now bringing your full
attention to it
and as you bring this focus on each
in breath think to yourself
breath and on each out breath
think to yourself body
each time breath
[Music]
body
[Music]
continue this for just a few seconds
[Music]
and as you practice this
you may feel a heightened sense of
awareness
[Music]
like a slight tingling in your
fingertips
and you may want to imagine your body
having a soft glow around it
as you feel a sense of yourself in the
space you are in
it can be a wonderful experience to
understand yourself
as conscious awareness
as an integral piece of a greater whole
removing the separation of the mind
in the physical world
as you are here in the state of presence
we can recognize just how easily we can
access this part of our experience
at any time peace
calm and presence is always available
for us to unlock
and as we recognize this
we also realize that our outside causes
of stress
and anxiety are natural
and normal but a place of peace
and calm within our minds
is also natural and accessible
as we recognize this and allow ourselves
this time
in presence share these affirmations
with me
you can imagine yourself floating
weightless in water
free of tension with nothing
around you
calm peaceful and free
[Music]
so now repeat these affirmations
after me either out loud or in your head
starting with breath
and body
peace and presence
[Music]
a calm mind
free and clear
[Music]
here and now
[Music]
stillness
[Music]
and let's do it once more with breath
and body
[Music]
peace and presence
a calm mind
free and clear
here and now
[Music]
stillness
and now keeping that warm glow
that natural breath that wonderful
feeling
of recognizing this time that is
all your own
go forward into the day
and remember that you can return back to
this place
of calming presence anytime
and so now to slowly come back
i'll count us down from five to one
and then take a few last moments if you
wish
five four
three two
[Music]
one
[Music]
