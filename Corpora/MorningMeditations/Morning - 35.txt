taking this moment
to set intention for a mindful practice
today
wherever you may be seated
or supported against a wall
close your eyes and bring your awareness
within
breathing in
[Music]
feeling every sensation of your breath
as it enters your body
inhale and as you exhale
slowly release not only the air
but any energy that has been weighing
you down today
let go of tension worry
frustration let it release as you slowly
sink
deeper and deeper into this beautiful
presence
and stillness
let it go
thank yourself for showing up today
and taking this time for your well-being
if you're joining me as part of our boho
beautiful 14-day journey
welcome to day 14.
inhale deeply
and exhale slowly
[Music]
find your presence
connecting deeper and deeper with your
own heart
connecting with the space
with this energy that lives within you
[Music]
the energy that remembers that beneath
all the aches and pains of this world
there exists a beautiful powerful
light of love and peace that is within
you
and this energy is untouchable
even with all the fear and doubt of your
mind it always
lives within radiant
and pure
so take another deep breath in
connect with this inner light
[Music]
let it feel your entire being with
strength
peace joy
and love remember
the truth of the universe
that you hold the power
a true spiritual warrior able to
manifest and bring forth strength
to conquer all that you are presented
with
big or small
so breathe in
and breathe out
you are powerful
the voice of your soul is pure and true
so choose now to create space within
space to listen
[Music]
open yourself to the powerful energy of
love that is always guiding your way
forward
as you go deeper into stillness
may this light shine your way through
the veil
the illusion that has kept you small
so step fourth release the limitation
step into the infinite potential that
you
hold
in
and breathe out
remember your true essence
you are love you
are peace you
are powerful awake
and free you
came to this earth with a light to shine
so it's time to shine it
always remembering that you are
protected
and that you are guided
so breathe in and breathe out
let yourself release deeper and deeper
into this power
connecting with your unlimited potential
and bringing it forward through your
heart
stay in this loving awareness
repeating the following mantra if you
begin to feel your mind
become pulled away by thoughts
i allow my inner strength and guidance
to show me the way i allow
my inner strength and guidance to show
me the way
[Music]
and now silently in your mind as you let
go
and go within
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
it's time to release the mantra
[Music]
slowly come back to your breath
breathing in gently and slowly
[Music]
bringing your awareness to your heart
your body
your being
[Music]
your light
[Music]
stay here for as long as you need
gently opening your eyes whenever
you're ready to finish your practice
from my heart to yours
with all of my love and my gratitude
