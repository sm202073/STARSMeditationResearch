welcome to this guided meditation for
empowered boundaries my name is
and I will guide you Dave through this
meditation
let yourself find a comfortable position
you can either be sitting or laying down
doing this meditation
just make sure that you are feeling
comfortable
and your body can be totally relaxed
I will be your guide on this journey
towards empowered boundaries
I will now invite you to listen to my
voice
start by having your eyes open
find a point
in front of you
that your eyes can focus on
right now you don't have to do anything
else
just
focus on the point in front of you
as you listen to my voice
eyes will feel more and more heavy
every time
I say the word
relax
you can feel that your eyes
becoming more and more blurry
and blinking more
to stay open
you'll feel that your eyelids
starting to feel heavier
and heavier
try to focus on the point
and you continue
to relax
even more
and your body is calm and safe
you start to struggle to keep your eyes
open
You Close Your Eyes now
when I say the word
relax
one final time
relax
our eyes are now closed
and you sink even deeper into yourself
feeling peaceful
and calm
listening to my voice
remember that you can always end the
meditation
and open your eyes whenever you want to
because you are in total control of your
mind and body
you are simply just
consciously giving
yourself permission
to be more and more relaxed
start by taking three

I now take you on a journey towards the
future version of you
a version of you that is stronger
and more grounded
I invite you to imagine
you're walking on a field
where the air is so clear and fresh
almost like Crystal Clear air
the wind
is touching your skin
as you walk
Every Breath You Take
you are being empowered with strength
and energy
every step you take
feel more
connected
to Mother Earth
and the powerful force
that is meeting your feet
with every
feel focused
and incomplete harmony with your body
mind
and soul
your senses are sharpening
and you feel so connected
with the Wind
grass
and plants
that you meet on your way
ahead of you
is a big Stone in the open field
you see that someone is waiting for you
you know
it is your future self
that you are going to meet
as you approach
see how your future self looks like
notice
how the future self is a stronger
more grounded
and focused version
of yourself
this version
knows exactly
how to sit clear boundaries without
feeling
guilt
this views yourself
is a version of you
that has pushed through the fear
of being rejected
when setting boundaries
of feeling selfish
this version of the future you
has unlocked
the knowledge and wisdom
that you are now
seeking
the future self-healths and important
message
for you
that you are receiving
the future self is giving you
an important message
from the future
listen closely
and ask the future self to explain
if you are unsure about what the message
means
the future self is reminding you
you are loved
and careful
and that your feelings are valid
whenever you need to set a boundary
you are also being reminded
that is completely natural
to doubt yourself
when setting a boundary with others
you are being reminded
to trust yourself even more
trust what you feel
your feelings are valid
ask the Future Self
what you can do to empower your
boundaries from now on
ask for thy wait guidance
thy Wicked tools
to empower yourself
when moving forward
foreign
future self to be specific
when you feel that you understand
guidance
you have just been given
you think the Future Self
for creating this space
to deliver
potent knowledge
that you have been seeking
you think the Future Self
give it a big hug
which connects you with each other
so you become one
say goodbye and return to the world
that you came from
slowly you start walking
back
you walk back on the field
you feel lighter and wiser
when moving forward
feel stronger
and confident
setting boundaries
from now on
you know that your feelings are valid
and you know that you can always return
to this
meditation
whenever you need to reconnect
with your future self
feel how the wisdom is now running
through your body
enlightening every cell
giving you more strength
be who you are
and to claim Who You Are
now start prepare
to return back
to your everyday life
start feeling your body
that is sitting or laying down
feel your legs
feel your stomach
feel your arms
and your chest
maybe move your fingers a little bit
start noticing the womb
around you
the noises
The Sounds around you and the
temperature in the womb
think yourself
for creating this safe space
to go Within
and to empower
yourself
when you feel witty
gently open your eyes
and notice the womb
start moving your body
and go on with your day
