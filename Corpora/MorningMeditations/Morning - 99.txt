and the lungs to expand fully within the ribcage

reframing and intentionally sending love

intentionally exciting start using words thoughts and emotions
that are supportive and nourishing to your receptive body
intentionally choosing to think about and view your body
in ways that are helpful not hurtful on your path forward
making each step that much easier for yourself
that much lighter more supportive
taking your power back tapping into the wisdom
that our ancestors cultivated through years of the practice
observation and implementation of mindfulness
of self-awareness of healing from the inside out
the sacred knowledge lost in the flood of technology and information
in this fast-paced world we live in today
a world often disconnected from our natural environment
from the healing magic found within us
the interconnectedness of all things found on this perfect blue
ball cruising through an ever-expanding Universe of Stardust
reconnecting with the magic of potential
of curiosity of exploring the world that is both our
life force and our playground
taking back the spark for life for your life
let this High vibrational energy you have found melt away all the negative
emotions let it re-light that spark let it melt away anything weighing you
down being this unconditional love into any
thoughts that stem from feeling unworthy comparing to others ideals or judging
yourself harshly see this conditioning for what it is
involuntary thoughts planted by others insecurities
and grown over years of social pressures
these thoughts do not belong to you although they are real
does not mean they are true dear one they are just one more thing picked up
along the way that you can decide to let go of to move on from
feel the energetic shift of every cell within your body in response to this
knowledge feel the wisdom the knowing
the truth of it coming back to you
today you drop any negativity you've picked up along your journey
today you vow in support of yourself
little by little day by day you will change your thoughts to be more
loving and supportive
on hard days you will have patience with your progress
and on easy days you will make strides forward
today you stand in front of this mirror and say out loud to yourself
I love you I accept you
I respect you poor you
wrapping your arms around yourself if doing so feels comfortable
and saying I love you I love you love you
feel the love you've craved for so long pour into you
stay here in this place as long as feels needed in this moment
emotions may overflow no longer holding them in or guarding
the expression that's okay let them flow
set yourself free allow your loving attention
your loving self-compassion to be there for you
to hold you in this moment and let them release
allow the open heartfelt energy to settle in this release
its expression
begin to call yourself back to the full spectrum of beauty within your body
be kind to yourself while transitioning through this integration stage
practice makes perfect more practice makes progress better yet
be gentle with yourself when taking notice of your progress
be diligent in providing yourself with the self-care acts that will heal and
nourish you
be supportive and choosing thoughts and actions
that reinforce your value that nourish your body
and that connect you more deeply to the world around you
you deserve to feel alive and energized each day
you deserve to take time to nourish your body with Stillness
or with movement and to do things that fill your soul
with joy
you deserve to take up space in any way that you choose to
you deserve the love you so freely give away to others
you deserve all the happiness you seek
know that it is within you and it is your divine Divine to pursue
it taking a few deep breaths into the belly
as you absorb the benefits of your practice
inviting you now to gently begin to bring yourself back
to a wakeful state in the present moment maybe wiggling your fingers or your toes
if that feels good for you and opening your eyes whenever you feel
ready feel your body softly Awakening
as your energy Glides through your body with these subtle movements
begin to sway back and forth if that feels nice
and ground yourself into this moment into your physical body
honoring the work you've done for yourself today dear one
for showing up was the hardest part
take care of yourself out there and don't forget to get outside and play
a little if you can you find light love and laughter in each
new day
