Oh
[Music]
hello my name is Sara Raymond and
welcome to this guided meditation but
was thing on being present and
practicing mindfulness I want to thank
you for taking the time to honor
yourself with this meditation I'm so
grateful you have chosen me as your
guide by using your breath as an anchor
you can get grounded in the present
moment at any time in your life
please find a comfortable place where
you can relax turn off any distractions
and not be disturbed
now make yourself comfortable either in
a seated or lying down position close
your eyes and begin to notice your
breath
you have chosen to take the time to
honor yourself in a positive way by
bringing mindfulness to the way that you
live you are strengthening the
connection between your body and your
mind
you have chosen to build a skill of
mindfulness and living in the present
without making any changes to your
breath
notice how it flows in through the nose
and fills up your body with life follow
the flow of the air as it goes into your
body through your nostrils and notice
how your chest and abdomen rise and fall
naturally as the breath comes in and
goes out
this breath will be your anchor and keep
you rooted in the present moment when
you focus on your breath you are always
focused in the present because you
cannot get back a past breath and you
cannot breathe in the future breath
before the present moment as you
continue to stay with the breath as an
anchor to the present moment
allow it to flow out releasing any
physical and emotional tension with each
exhale and allow the awareness of your
breath to spread throughout your body
as you still may have thoughts going
through your mind notice them from afar
as if you are an observer and now begin
to deepen each breath in and out
and as your breath fills you up more
fully focus your attention on the
stillness that comes between the inhale
and the exhale allow the stillness to
last a little longer
pausing holding the breath momentarily
between the inhale and the exhale
breathe in this way for three more
cycles and feel the tension melt away
from your body to be gone forever give
yourself permission to be fully
supported by your surroundings and be
open to the possibility of what comes
with a state of comfort allow your mind
to quiet and the noises and
responsibilities of the world around you
to turn off
in just a moment you are going to
continue this practice of awareness
and bring your awareness to your
physical body in order to relax every
part of your body beginning at the top
of your head moving all the way down to
the bottom of your feet
as you hear each part of your body being
spoken you will first bring your
awareness to that body part
noticing how it feels without judgment
but relax that part deeply
now turn your attention to the top of
your head visualize and feel your scalp
and head
and then relax
begin to progressively release each
muscle small and large
from your head all the way down to your
toes
notice how powerful the sense of your
body is and how just a thought in your
mind you can have the ability to relax
your entire body so deeply you begin to
feel your forehead soften and smooth
your eyebrows and eyes melt
the tiny muscles around your eyes
release you feel your eyelids becoming
very heavy your cheeks soften you part
your teeth unclench your jaw and relax
your tongue
you feel your throat softening and the
neck let's go of any held tension
you feel your shoulders relaxed
completely
you feel the warm comfort moving
downward continuing this progressive
relaxation
feel the tension melting out of your
shoulders moving down your arms and
flowing out of your body through your
fingertips
with each breath notice the contraction
and expansion of your abdomen and chest
as you begin to feel heavy
allow your chest muscles to relax
completely
and though that you are fully supported
notice how deep and calm your breath has
become as you continue to relax deeper
and deeper
[Music]
what other sensations do you notice in
this moment
the simple process of noticing your
breath your physical body and your
surroundings is such a powerful tool for
relaxation and stress relief this
comfort begins to move down your body
releasing the tension from your lower
back and hips your thighs feel heavy and
sink into the surface below you your
knees soften and your calves melt and as
your body continues to rest heavy your
ankles and feet let go of any remaining
tension your body feels to be completely
relaxed safe and supported
you now allow yourself to drift into a
deep state of relaxation letting
yourself go
[Music]
and as you continue to focus on your
breath
and your physical body follow the sound
of my voice on this journey of
relaxation
[Music]
take notice of any thoughts that come
into your mind
simply acknowledge the thought and allow
your breath
to carry it away
now as you continue to relax begin to
use your imagination and see yourself on
a soft fluffy white cloud
this cloud is special and it is just for
you when you lay down on this cloud it
fits you perfectly it supports you
entirely so you can let go of any need
for holding on
this is the most perfect and comfortable
cloud made just for you and you will
safely take a journey on this cloud as
it will drift you off to your most
favorite peaceful place
with your imagination see this beautiful
place in vivid detail or you are happy
you are calm and you are at peace
feel that the temperature around you is
perfect just for you this place may be a
place that you have been to before or
one that exists only in your imagination
any place that you are happy and that
piece is perfect see yourself in this
peaceful place taken all of your
surroundings use all of your senses
hear the sounds smell the smells
and know that when you are in this
perfect place nothing bad can happen you
are safe and supported you are
completely in control

state incredible changes can be made
with your subconscious mind

your truest self than you have ever been
before

place in just a moment I'm going to
count down from ten to one and as I do
you can allow yourself to relax
completely on the soft cloud

deeper and deeper into relaxation and

deeper into comfort
