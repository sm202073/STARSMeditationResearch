[Music]
it's been an incredible day a mixture
you know and I think in many ways that
sums up most of our days right it's um
it's always a mixture of things but I
thought be a nice way to end the day
just with with a meditation a short
meditation by the fire and whether you
choose to keep your eyes open or eyes
closed the thing I'd really like you to
focus on then I'm gonna focus on is the
sound of the fire so we're gonna use
that sound as our as our object of
meditation if that feels too abstract
feels too strange you can always come
back to the to the breath
but we're gonna just rest our attention
in that crackling sound with the fire
something really relaxing about it
there's nothing to do the fire does the
job for us all we have to do is just
realize when the minds wandered off and
come back and rest in that crackle of
the fire so just take a moment make sure
you're is sitting comfortably in join me
for a little meditation by the campfire
so once you're sitting comfortably just
gonna have the fire as your as your sort
of focal focal point if you're watching
this but you're still aware of the space
either side the rock below the sky above
but it's almost as though the dancing
flames they they don't allow the mind to
be all the attention to be fixed in one
place the mind naturally is encouraged
to widen to soften to relax
and then just taking a deep breath in
through the nose breathing in the fresh
air and as you breathe out just letting
go of the day do that again another
couple of times each time just a sense
of letting go
and with the next out breath you can
either gently soften the focus back on
the fire or just gently close the eyes
perhaps a sense of putting down any
baggage from the day
is failing the weight of the body
I'm just settling into that sound the
wind the flames the crackling wood
maybe you can hear the water in the lake
which is getting comfortable in this
space
now as you check in with the body this
edges a sense of leaving behind any
tension from the day
Center any thoughts being left behind
it's very briefly noticing the breath
and then just settling the attention the
focus on the fire you can do this is a
visual exercise it was softening the
focus each time coming back to the dance
of the flames or you can use the sound
of the wind sound of the flame crackling
of the wood is your point of focus and
the fires creating the object of focus
for us there's nothing for us to do
each time we realized the minds wondered
of
[Music]
as you focus on that sound or on the
image of the fire maybe even remembering
a time when you'd be next to a fire
remembering the smell of the wood
sensor you're sitting right here we're
sitting right here together the sound of
the lake behind us
and the flames just constantly moving
just creating that space in the mind
just staying without for a few moments
more
and then as you resting that sound is
you look at that image just letting the
mind do whatever it wants to do now just
allowing the mind to be completely free
maintaining the soft focus if the eyes
are open if they're not just gently
opening the eyes and coming back to as
soft gaze the fire in front
coming back to that feeling of white in
contact at the body it's a surface
beneath you
enjoying a sense of relief having let go
the body in the mind
I'm going to bed hopefully feeling a
little more rested a little more at ease
and whenever you're ready just blinking
a few times just refocusing the eyes
going back to fire
I throw the space around you and thank
you for joining me by the campfire
tonight it's I feel like in just in a
few minutes that we've been sat here
through somehow transitioned from
daytime in tonight it's a good way to
end the day
