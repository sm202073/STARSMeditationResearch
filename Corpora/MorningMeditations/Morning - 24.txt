hey guys welcome to your
day 3 meditation
im so happy that your taking this time our of your day and dedicating it to yourself
your health and wellbeing
this meditation is going to be focused on finding peace and contentment
sometimes we all worry about the
future overanalyze the past
and over think the choices that have brough us here to this present moment
the truth is
over analyzing the past
and worrying the future
bring absolutely no benefit to your
the moment your in right now
this moment is the only
you truly have
by letting go of your past
weather good or bad
and accepting that
this is you right here
right now
will allow today to unfold as it should
taking this time
to find gratitude
for the blessing you've been given
and the lessons you have learnde
to find peace and true contentment in who you are
where you are and how you came to be here
by freeing yourself of the burdens of tomorrow
you give yourself permission to focus on this present moment
and on creating a better version of yourself
with this in mind
lets now begin our meditation
making yourself comfortable
in a seated position
go ahead and rest your hands on your knees
taking a deep breath in
and a slow exhale out
letting go of any tension
allow yourself to become one with the breath
inhale and exhale
and again just simply let yourself let go
release into the breath
inhale
exhale
feeling the oxygen
filling your lungs and body
filling every cell of your body
allowing yourself to become more and more relaxed
inhale and exhale
deep breath through your nose and exhale
let it go
begin to feel your body become more at ease and relaxed
feeling the coolness of the air coming in
as you inhale
and feeling the warmth of the air as you exhale
bring a sense of peace to your whole being
inhale and exhale
and let it go exhale
its now time to introduce our mantra
and our entering thought
staying in a nice comfortable position
repeating this in your mind
I'm exactly where i need to be
I'm exactly where i need to be
I'm exactly where i need to be
remember to stay kind and patient with your mind
if thoughts arise and you get distracted
by surrounding noises
sensations in your body
simply acknowledge them
and then let them go
with that allow yourself to come back to your breathe
and come back to your mantra
I'm exactly where i need to be
I'm exactly where i need to be
I'm exactly where i need to be
and now silently in your mind
its time to release the mantra
slowly begin to bring your awareness back to the body
slowly coming back to your body
if you wish you may slowly begin
to wiggle one finger, one toe
just feeling your body become a little bit more alive
whenever you're ready
you may slowly begin to
open your eyes
and take your time here no rush
give the body the time it needs to come back
thank you guys so much for joining me

calm
and ready to have the most wonderful day
