[Music]
as you come into your seated position
comfortably and gently
with your spine straight take this
opportunity to
close your eyes breathe in
deeply and breathe out
slowly
give yourself permission to simply let
go
into this moment feel the ground
underneath you holding you
supporting you
[Music]
feel your heart gently slowing down as
you welcome
deeper and deeper relaxation into your
body
and into your mind
breathe in
breathe out let yourself
meld into stillness
[Music]
thank yourself for finding time in your
day
and dedicating into your health into
your well-being
[Music]
if you're joining me as part of the 14
day boho beautiful journey
welcome to day 13.
allow yourself to settle into the
stillness
this present awareness
consciously let go of any tension that
you may be still holding onto
[Music]
breathe it out let it release
out of your body out of your mind
[Music]
inhale and
exhale
with your eyes closed visualize and see
yourself
sitting on a beautiful calm beach
see yourself in the middle of this
beautiful place
feeling safe and protected
[Music]
notice what you see
[Music]
notice the color of the water
[Music]
the texture of the sand
the trees the waves
the stillness
[Music]
as you sit in this beautiful paradise
see if you can feel the warmth of the
sun on your
skin feel the warm sensation of love
overcoming your being
feel it feel the sun rays
kissing your face
feel the energy of this loving
place all around you
[Music]
this loving energy
the energy of grace
[Music]
grace is all around us
it shows us that everything in our life
is unfolding in divine order
[Music]
so breathe in
and breathe out
stay connected to your heart as you let
go
deeper and deeper into this beautiful
state
of stillness
stay connected to this beautiful energy
of love peace
and grace and let it guide you forward
through gratitude
inhale and
exhale gratitude
is one of the greatest tools that we can
use to activate
and welcome grace into our life
so as you stay in this stillness feeling
the warmth and loving energy
all around you begin to shine your
gratitude
out of your heart and into the vast
magical universe that's around you
see the slight beaming out of your heart
pouring and sending this loving energy
to your loved ones your friends
your family members your community
the entire world
send your light out with the intention
of bringing more healing
and love to anyone that you think may
need it in this moment
open your heart and send them all of
your love that is within you
all of your light
breathe in
breathe out
[Music]
stay in the presence of love
and light as you begin to welcome
more gratitude and peace through the
following mantra
repeating the first part and completing
the rest
with whatever comes to your own heart
thank you
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you for my health
thank you for my strength
thank you for my patience
thank you
[Music]
continue with this mantra silently in
your mind
as you release all the love and
gratitude that exists within you
in your own heart
[Music]
breathe in
and breathe out
it's time to slowly release your mantra
coming back to your breath
back to your body to your center
stay in this beautiful space for as long
as you need
slowly leaving this magical beach
and returning back to your present
awareness
and opening your eyes whenever you are
ready
as you close off this meditation
be thankful for this day
for this breath for this moment
of peace and connection
remember grace is always with you
and this life is beautiful
in every way that it unfolds
from my heart to yours with love
and all my gratitude namaste
