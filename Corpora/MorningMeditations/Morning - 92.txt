you are stronger than you even know
this guided mindfulness meditation
will help you to understand yourself
more deeply
and find that place of deep power and
strength
[Music]
start by finding a comfortable seated
position
and just take a few
deep breaths
close your eyes if you like
and begin to focus your attention inward
as you draw your attention to your
relaxed and comfortable breaths
take a moment to become aware
of your thoughts and emotions
and just
let them be
without any judgment
and as you do so
begin to imagine
a bright and powerful light at the
center of your chest
it may be pulsing
and glowing
brighter and brighter with each breath
this light represents your inner
strength and power
now I invite you
to repeat
three affirmations to yourself
you can do this out loud or in your head
just repeat after me now
I have the power to overcome any
challenge
I am deserving of joy and peace
I have Inner Strength
feel these words sink into your soul
into that bright light within you
and fill you with a sense of calm
know that you are in control of your
thoughts and emotions
and that you have the power
to shape your own reality
just try these affirmations once more
repeating after me
starting now
I have the power to overcome any
challenge
I am deserving of joy and peace
I have Inner Strength
now as you continue to enjoy this time
breathing comfortably
focusing on the present moment and
feeling that comforting Light Within you
imagine releasing any remaining tension
or stress
that you may be holding on to
let it dissolve all the way down into
the ground
and feel yourself
becoming lighter
almost weightless
and more relaxed with every breath
foreign
remember that this Inner Strength is
always within you
and you can call upon it whenever you
need it
take a moment to give thanks for this
powerful force in your life
and know that you are capable of doing
great things
you have an incredible Inner Strength
embrace it
take it with you
my spoken portion of this meditation
will end now
and the ambient music will continue on
for several minutes
feel free to close your eyes
or keep them closed if they already are
and in this time
just enjoy the calming reflection
starting now
