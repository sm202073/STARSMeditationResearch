guided mindfulness meditation
unacceptance
been letting go
allow yourself this time to find a
comforting balance and centeredness
within yourself
find a comfortable spot where you can
bring focus to your attention for these
few minutes
began breathing gently in and out as you
start to take notice of your pattern of
breathing
just allow your arms and legs to release
any tension
just let gravity hold them gently
downward feel that gentle breath in
endowed
[Music]
you're just moving up and down slowly
and comfortably
and on the next slope breath just let
your limbs relax even further
releasing any of that remaining tension
during this time you may become
especially aware of your senses the
feeling of the surfaces
you're touching against the amount of
light in the room and you will hear
detailed sounds that may have otherwise
gone unnoticed and all of these are fine
just allow yourself to experience these
sensations and accept them without
judgement
breathing gently in and out sitting
comfortably
just take a moment to find the centered
feeling of the present moment
[Music]
and as you become increasingly aware and
increasingly centered you are now open
to contemplate the topic of this
meditation
you
continuing
to gently breathe
to raise your awareness to feel the
space around you you'll focus on
this concept of accepting and letting go
take a moment and imagine an incident
long in the past that gives you regret
something that
pops into your minds fairly often maybe
you said something wrong maybe you hurt
somebody's feelings maybe you felt
embarrassed by something you did
whatever it was think about the amount
of time that you have spent thinking
back on that time
when you look at it in this context
doesn't it seem like a waste of our
energy
doesn't it seem unnecessary
what does it accomplish for us to relive
these moments in the past the answer is
often nothing of course it is always
good to be conscious of our mistakes and
make situations right when we must but
what we also must learn is how to
recognize the beneficial awareness while
discarding the useless regret and
anxiety that only serves to make us feel
bad without resolving anything
as you remain focused on this skull
let us continue to deepen our
understanding by maintaining our
awareness on my voice and your breath
and the space around you slowly gently
in and out we can learn to accept by
living in the present moment we can
learn to let go
by living in there now you can also take
this knowledge as it pertains to someone
who may have done you wrong in the same
way as you think about how your mind
reacts to your own mistakes use this
presence and centeredness to see a
clearer picture of those who you feel
have wronged you
[Music]
and this will help you to forge a
clearer path of how to resolve the
situation
and again mitigate the thoughts that
provide no solution and take your mental
energy away from peace
[Music]
and as we continue to focus gently
breathing we will do a slow countdown
and I'll ask you to repeat these phrases
after me either out loud or in your mind
gently and easily starting with
five
awareness of my thoughts
for awareness of the present moment
three letting go of regret two forgiving
others one
acceptance
[Music]
continue to remain focused and deeply
peaceful as we count to home once more
five awareness of my thoughts
for awareness of the present moment
three letting go of regrets
[Music]
to
forgiving others
[Music]
one acceptance
[Music]
being aware that the past is the past in
the future is only an idea of what is to
come
we can take problems step by step
resolving them with a calm and focused
approach
[Music]
focus on the present moment
and learn acceptance and letting go
