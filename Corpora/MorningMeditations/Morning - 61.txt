hello
and welcome to a guided mindfulness
meditation
on showing kindness to yourself
this is a brief session
that is designed to help you relax into
the present moment
and realize that
you are facing challenges
just like so many others
and you deserve to go easy on yourself
and allow yourself to
sometimes struggle
or feel pain
or sadness
we meditate and practice mindfulness
to ease unnecessary feelings of pain
[Music]
but it doesn't mean that we can't allow
ourselves to sometimes simply
feel
[Music]
and so as we begin
as always bring your attention
to your breath and body
sitting comfortably
and relaxing
every muscle
in your body
on each breath
in and out
feel a sensation of calm
flow over you
just breathing
ever so naturally
you can let it
blow over you like a waterfall
moving from the very top of your head
all the way
down through your arms
and hands
relaxing those muscles
then all the way down through your legs
still that natural breathing in
and relaxing out
and finally flowing down
into your feet
feeling that
relaxing calming water flow
all throughout your body
[Music]
and then noticing that air flow
in and out of your lungs
[Music]
the air moving past your nostrils
you may even sense your heart pumping
blood through your body
[Music]
you sense your ears attuned to my voice
and to the ambient music
and again continuing natural
calm breaths
recognizing them in
and out
stay here in this place of peace and
presence
for just a few moments
[Music]
[Music]
fantastic
and now
i will ask you to simply listen to my
suggestions and feel them deeply
remember to continue to stay present and
aware
as i share these suggestions with you
calm and relaxed in body
and mind
[Music]
you have strength and willpower
you are brave
[Music]
you
are kind and thoughtful
[Music]
you are helpful
and compassionate
you deserve freedom from suffering
[Music]
you deserve freedom
from pain
you do
you deserve
kindness
toward yourself
[Music]
great job with the focus and
concentration
for a moment
think back about
if any of those phrases hit you
especially deeply
it could be perhaps you don't feel
particularly brave
or maybe you are in the midst of a
painful time
and are not sure if you deserve to be
free of it
maybe some days
you don't feel particularly strong or
brave
and maybe you believe all of those
things
but you simply need to feel them
more deeply for yourself
and so this time
i ask you to repeat after me
either out loud or just in your head
whichever suits you
[Music]
i'll ask you to speak these phrases as
affirmations
and i'll start now
i have strength and willpower
i am brave
[Music]
i am kind
and thoughtful
[Music]
i am helpful
and compassionate
i deserve freedom from suffering
[Music]
i deserve freedom
from pain
i deserve kindness toward myself
[Music]
i deserve kindness
toward myself
[Music]
excellent job
if you like
you can continue to focus on these ideas
for several more minutes
just continuing to feel each idea deeply
find a renewed relationship with
yourself
and remember
that you
in this very moment in the present
is all
that we have
and it is truly important to treat it
well
no matter how difficult the challenge is
remembering strength
willpower
bravery
freedom from pain and suffering
and kindness
[Music]
kindness toward others
and with equal importance
kindness
toward yourself
you
deserve it
[Music]
this concludes the spoken portion
of this meditation
thank you for joining me today
[Music]
you
