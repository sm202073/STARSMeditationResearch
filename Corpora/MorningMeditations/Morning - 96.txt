visualize
that you're walking down as their case
as your food
touches the first step
weave
Blissful Tranquility passes
through your entire body
you arrive at the second step
you're feeling calm
and relaxed
you step down
a third time
sliding
deeper into a state
you take a fifth step
the final
step
you are feeling completely safe
clean
gently
as you feel more and more
relaxed
you are even more
centered with yourself
and you feel totally safe
to flow on this wave
of relaxing energy

[Music]
the door is locked
you stand in front of the door
yourself
with your current age
in life circumstances
take a moment to notice
how you're feeling about your life
without judging
your emotions
all thoughts
simply just observe and notice
where you are directing
your energy
in general
gently
[Music]
feel your heart your heart's energy
that should look at yourself with
compassion
you see
that you have come a very long way
and it was not
maybe you have felt alone a lot
and that no one
was there
carried the burden
of your heart
feel your heart's energy
even deeper now
to allow
all
the emotions
to be felt
foreign
you have felt that
you were abandoned
and that you haven't been found yet
validate
what you are feeling in this moment
remember
your feelings are true
and they are always allowed to be filled
by you
allow yourself
to really feel
into yourself
allow yourself in this safe space
to feel your emotions
denying them
or ignore them
they are coming up because they want to
be filled
and you are safe
to feel them
the more you allow
your emotions to be there
the more you allow
how they change
how the energy
foreign
change
they don't feel heavy in the same way
anymore
in fact they feel a little lighter now
simply because you have allowed the
energy
to pass
you have allowed the energy
to flow
to release it
and you start to feel
lighter
lighter lighter
the Green Door
did you standing in front of
is your future
the moment you open the door
and walk through it
you are leaving your past behind
you are leaving behind everything that
doesn't serve you anymore and you're
walking
towards your future
prepare yourself to open the door
Maybe
take a deep breath here
and release
whatever may be left
inside of you that doesn't serve you
anymore
by taking the deep breath
go
for to have been holding on to for so
Maybe
it can help you to say in your head
I allow myself
to let go of past emotions
that kept me stuck
I allow myself
to move forward
I allow myself
to move forward
to a brighter
I forgive myself
for holding on to the emotions
that don't serve me anymore
I now release
past pain

the warm and heartfelt energy
that surrounds you

is shining
through every cell
of you

and renewing your soul

that you are loved
protected
and cared for

of your angels
and you feel so relaxed
safe
as you stand
[Music]
bright light
take a final look back
door
and what you came from
take a look at how you were feeling
how much pain
you were caring within your heart
notice how you have detached from it by
walking through the door
you have completely
detached from all the feelings that were
keeping you small
that were making you feel unsafe
unloved
and unhappy
take a deep breath here
and celebrate
what you have just released
notice how it feels in your body
to let go of so much pain
notice how it feels like
to let go of so
many frustrations
so much confusion
