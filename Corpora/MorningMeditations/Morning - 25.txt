welcome to our meditation for peace
Today's meditation, is going to be all about learning how to be still and mindful of each breath
The goal of our meditation is to allow ourselves to connect deeper with our inner selves
By taking this time to slow, down and allow ourselves to connect to each moment
We realize that, we are much greater than this physical form we embody?
We are souls with, bodies
Not bodies with souls
Take a deep breath let's begin with our meditation
find a comfortable position
You, can, be seated on a pillow on the floor or on your bed
or anywhere leaning against the wall
Just find a place for yourself
Or there's peace and quiet and where you can, allow. Yourself to go, deep within
Close your eyes begin to bring all of your awareness to your breath
inhaling slowly and deeply through your nose
And exhaling gently through your nose or mouth
inhale and exhale
Allow, your hands to be rested on your knees?
You can, either keep your palms up or you can, keep them facing downward whatever is most comfortable
Feel the surface underneath your sit bones
Whether that is a pillow or the floor?
Allow, yourself to slowly begin to sink and melt into the ground
let go
allow, your eyes to feel heavy
Letting them rest as you continue to breathe, deeply
relax, your entire face
Let go of any motions or thoughts
Simply, allow. Your mind to take a. Pause from analyzing judging or thinking
give yourself permission to rest
inhale and exhale
Begin to feel your spine become elongated from the very base to the very crown of your head
Noticing that powerful energy running through you
Allow, your hands to be relaxed your shoulders to be relaxed
Just feeling the belly rise and fall as you gently breathe
inhale and
exhale
Let go of your body
Let go of everything that you know
Simply, allow, yourself to enjoy, this very present moment
Enjoying, each inhalation and exhalation
If you notice any thoughts and to your mind
Do not let that be discouraging it's very normal to notice different mind chatter and to your mind especially when you're first
understanding the process of meditation
Simply, acknowledge that the thoughts are there and then come back to the breath
Visualize, these thoughts as clouds drifting through a, beautiful blue sky
Notice that they're there but, don't pay any attention to what they mean
Just let them drift on by as you let, go
inhale and
exhale as
