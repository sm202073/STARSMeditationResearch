there will be times in all of our lives
when we will inevitably experience
suffering
and loss you may be going through this
right now or you may have gone through
it in the past
in these situations you may feel
overwhelmed
detached fearful or full of anxiety
confusion helplessness or
profound sadness
to a certain extent these feelings are
human and
normal however they can be magnified
even more
if a tragic event strikes whether as a
close personal situation
[Music]
or as a difficult event on a larger
scale
many we are seeing on a daily basis
this meditation session is intended to
help us
understand our feelings and connect more
deeply
with the present moment
it will help us to see the underlying
beauty
despite the challenging circumstances
to begin as i so often suggest
find a comfortable position
either seated in a chair or cross-legged
on the ground
sitting on carpet or having a pillow
beneath you
can help aim to have your body
in a position that keeps you at ease
but does not cause you to drift off to
sleep
be relaxed yet alert
take a few deep and gentle breaths
in and out
begin to draw your attention to the
movement
of your chest
into the airflow of your breath in
and out
[Music]
raise your awareness of your own body
arms legs
head
that gentle movement of the chest
finding presence and awareness
and as you settle in now we bring
ourselves
to a point of focus what is it that is
weighing heaviest on your mind
suffering and grief can be overwhelming
and you may struggle to know exactly how
you should be feeling
think about this question and take a
moment to recognize
those scenarios and those specific
feelings that are taking over your
thoughts
in the next minute or so try to mentally
narrow down your biggest points of
trouble
or struggle to the top three
some may be obvious or others
less so so take a minute
and try to imagine those top three now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
as you continue to breathe so gently
and be aware of your body in the space
that you are in
we will attempt to dissect these
thoughts
and dissolve unnecessary pain
and suffering
something that can help us is to
recognize
what we can and cannot do
about it
when you think of these top three items
weighing on your mind
consider what are the things that you
can personally control
for example you can't take away
someone's sickness
but you can be compassionate toward them
and toward their friends and family
or although you cannot bring a loved one
back that has passed away
you can honor their memory and continue
to spread
love on their behalf
[Music]
sit and breathe in comfortable awareness
and take a few moments to consider this
for each thought
which part is out of your control
and which part can you control
think about this now
[Music]
[Music]
as you keep these thoughts in mind think
about what these actions would mean to
you
if you were the one who suffered or was
feeling lost
this practice helps us to realize that
there is a lot we often cannot control
if we allow those things to weigh
heaviest on our minds
it can take away from our positive
energy
we can make a large impact by
transferring that energy
into an area of action that can
make a difference
now it is time to let go
continue to breathe ever so calmly and
gently
feeling that awareness of your breath
and of your body
allow yourself to feel this present
moment
and realize that you are here
sitting with your thoughts just you
right now
and as we start to let go think again
of those things that you cannot change
and realize how those intrusive thoughts
will only weigh you down
take another calm and gentle breath and
say to yourself
i let them go
imagine those intrusive thoughts as a
light balloon
floating away rather than a heavy anvil
on your mind say to yourself again
i let them go
each time imagine a small
weight being lifted off your chest
like these ocean waves drifting
away
each breath allowing you to feel lighter
and free
allow your mind to become open accepting
of thought
but aware of each thought that comes
about
if a negative thought arises catch that
thought
and imagine a positive thought or action
to counteract and let go of the bad
for just a bit longer as you continue
to breathe gently and draw focus
to your breath body
and mind spend
these last few minutes catching your
thoughts as they arise
and imagining positivity
and strength
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
well done now as you slowly prepare
to go about your day choose an action
small or large to implement
and put into action today
spreading joy and compassion are some of
our best ways
to combat the struggles and challenges
that we all face
find a connection to those around you
near
and far young and old
suffering and healthy
send and share your love and kindness
even in small ways
now as you prepare to go out and spread
positive energy and feel positive energy
for yourself
let's take five last deep
and rejuvenating breaths counting down
from five
four
three
two
one
[Music]
wonderful job
go about your day feeling uplifted
and free of negative energy
