Welcome to our meditation for healing
this meditation today is going to be focused on guiding good high frequency energy and
Vibrations towards those areas within you that are need of healing and love
Physically emotionally or spiritually?
Let's take a moment and allow ourselves to truly feel how we feel today with honesty and openness with ourselves
Accepting any sort of emotions. You may have
Allowing yourself to truly sit with it for a moment
accept it and
Then make a decision to let go
Accepting ourselves as we are today
Is one of the only ways?
We can overcome and heal from whatever it. Is that is bothering us
Your body is the vehicle to life, but without a healthy mind our vehicles cannot function to their best abilities
So today let's focus on that connection between your body mind and soul
Welcoming positive energy into any parts or areas of your mind and body that needed the most
So let's begin let's start by coming into a seated position
Comfortably on the bed the floor or chair
Just taking a moment really grounding your sit bones feeling the spine nice and long
Just start by bring all of your awareness to your breath
Taking a deep breath into your nose and a very gentle long exhale out of your mouth
Become aware of how you're feeling
any thoughts that are sitting with you and
emotions that are rising
Accept them for what they are
Take a deep breath in
And then slowly let it go
Letting go of any tension in your body
Allowing your shoulders to let go and release down or Dawei from your ears
Just getting the gentle movement of your chest as you breathe in and out
Let's rest our hands comfortably on her knees
Your choice to keep the hands open or palms facing downward
Again, just staying with your breath here
Let's take one more deep inhalation
and the long exhalation out
Allowing all the tension to melt away out of your mind out of your body
Take a deep breath in
Feeling any sensations through your body
bringing oxygen to your brain
To your heart and to every cell of your body
inhale
and exhale
allow this clean and crisp feeling of air
To purify your mind of any clutter
thoughts of the future the past
Or expectations of this moment
deep Breath in and a long exhale out
And again one more deep breath in
Long Exhale out just feeling that state of relaxation overcoming your entire body
Allowing all of your weight to sink into the ground into the Earth beneath you
