let's start by getting comfortable
either laying or sitting down
and if you feel comfortable closing your
eyes now it's a great time to do so
if not
find a place in front of you to focus on
now for three deep breaths in through
the nose
holding and out through the mouth for a
count of three
in one
three hold

out one two

now that we are centered and focused on
our breath
you're going to start their
visualization
yes I know that Sunday nights can be
scary at times the dreaded nine to five
waiting for you tomorrow
so I want to bring you this meditation
to bring some calm in your Sunday
and I want you to visualize
visualize your ideal one day
right now I want you to continue to
focus on your breath
in the fall
of your belly or your chest
[Music]
feel the breath moving in to your belly
and out of your belly
now it's time to visualize your most
ideal day
focus on your breath
You Can Let My Words Fall Away
in your mind fall into your own
imagine yourself Rising without an alarm
at the perfect time to start your day
think about your favorite breakfast
it's now sitting on your kitchen counter
waiting for you to enjoy
you see yourself in your home
enjoying your morning routine
now is the time
to finally have your idea of a morning
routine
maybe a morning meditation followed by a
journaling session
and your favorite bodies instructor
each step of your morning routine being
completed
how good it feels inside
your heart
you're being set up for a perfect Monday
everything seems to go be going as
planned for your commute
and before you know it it's lunchtime
the boss decides today's lunch is on
them so you head to your favorite Thai
place or your favorite dish of peanut
Curry
us
back at the office after a nice relaxing
lunch outside in the sunshine
and I want you to Envision
off each task
check
every single large task has been checked
off
by your afternoon break
you decide to take a walk
in the park close by to the office
[Music]
visualize that last
task
that last check being made
that one thing that you find on your
list for weeks has been finished
as luck would have it
as soon as your hand leaves the page
your day is done
you end your day in the most idyllic way
spending time with loved ones and
reading before bed
your day has been productive with little
spots of wander and joy
[Music]
your Monday can go something like this
not exactly
focus on the parts of your work days
that you enjoy
and I want you to take one final breath
in
with a cleansing breath out
[Music]
so it is
you can open your eyes
and if you feel called grab your journal
and write about this experience
thank you
hope you have a wonderful day
