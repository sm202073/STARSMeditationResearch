this
is a guided mindfulness meditation
on meaningful connections
[Music]
how often do we get stuck in our own
head
do we pay attention to when others need
help
do we take a moment to ask a friend or
family member
if they are doing okay
do we ask for help when we need it
this session will help us to bring
ourselves
into the present moment and understand
the power
of meaningful communication with those
we love and care about
it is about listening in a real and true
way
it's letting our own mind step out of
the way
in learning to understand the ones we
care about
more deeply and profoundly
through this practice you will help
others to better connect with you
and you will become more content and
connected
[Music]
present with others in the here
and now
as i often ask of you find
a comfortable place to sit
cross-legged on a pillow or
in a chair is great
remember to keep your spine straight
and shoulders gently rolled back
let's do a few quick stretches to get
started
so right now if you wish take your right
arm
and slowly bring it across your body
bring your right arm across the front of
your body and give it a gentle pull
with your other arm and just count to
five
[Music]
and then release
now take your left arm
and pull it across the front of your
body the same way
gently pull and count to five
and release
and now keeping your shoulders facing
forward
slowly turn your head to face to the
right
and allow a gentle stretch
as you count again to five
and bring your head slowly back to face
the front
[Music]
now do the same thing to your left
slowly turning your head feeling that
gentle stretch
and counting to five
[Music]
and bring your head slowly back to face
forward
[Music]
and lastly slowly look downward
bringing your chin closer to your chest
feel that gentle stretch in your neck
[Music]
count slowly to five
and bring your head slowly back up
[Music]
let go of any remaining tension with a
slow
deep breath
[Music]
and long release
[Music]
and once more slow deep breath
and release
that calming feeling of your muscles
loosening
and your attention moving into this
present moment
just enjoy it for a few seconds
[Music]
continue to bring your attention to your
breathing
now just a steady and natural in
and out feeling your lungs fill
while your chest moves outward
and each time releasing feeling the air
flow
gently out through your nostrils
breathing naturally just repeating this
constant
and calming cycle
and as you bring in your focus
know that stray thoughts may enter your
mind
give yourself permission to recognize
them
and acknowledge them
but then just gently brush them away
letting your focus return to your breath
in chest
moving out and then your breath
back out air flowing
through your nostrils
[Music]
refocus your attention as many times
as needed
and now with all of these ideas in mind
[Music]
we will take several silent minutes
for you to bring yourself into this
place
of focus and presence
and we will go there for yourself
so that you may in turn find that place
of presence for others
breathing in and out
and brushing away distracting thoughts
take those couple of minutes now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
great job
now as you are here in this present
moment
with muscles relaxed and attention
focused on your breath and body
we will remind ourselves of the
importance
of listening of presence
of compassion
[Music]
in these suggestions that i will soon
give
feel free to replace the phrase loved
ones
with the words friends
family or any word
that suits you best
and so whether out loud or in your head
just repeat these short mantras after me
[Music]
my loved ones are dear to me
[Music]
i am reminded to listen to my loved ones
[Music]
i am reminded to be present with my
loved ones
i am reminded to ask for help when i
need it
i will show compassion and care
[Music]
great sit with these ideas for a few
[Music]
moments
and now continuing to keep that natural
breathing
and relaxed body
repeat these phrases once again
[Music]
my loved ones are dear to me
[Music]
i am reminded to listen to my loved ones
i am reminded to be present
with my loved ones
i am reminded to ask for help when i
need it
[Music]
i will show compassion and
care
[Music]
very nicely done
take the next several minutes to remain
here
in this present moment and reflect
on these ideas thinking about those who
are close to you
and the ways in which you can become
closer to them
understanding their feelings and
emotions
and helping them to understand yours
[Music]
breathing gently and with all muscles
so relaxed reflect on this
now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
fantastic job
in a few moments we will end this
session
and as we do remember
that your ability to remain focused in
the present
will help you to engage more deeply with
those around you
remember to ask them the simple
questions
such as how are you
and are you doing okay
and then truly listen
[Music]
be empathetic and share your own
feelings in return
practice this daily and you will
discover
a more fulfilling life
more deeply connected with those you
care most about
[Music]
as you keep these thoughts in mind
we will slowly count from five to one
and end the session
remembering compassion
empathy and presence
[Music]
listening and connecting to those in our
life
[Music]
