you
are worthy of love
and you are worthy of loving yourself
this means having forgiveness for
yourself
[Music]
and taking care of yourself first
this will in turn result
in a deeper care for others
[Music]
this guided mindfulness meditation
session
will focus on these ideas
notice your pattern of breathing
gentle relaxed breaths in
and out
[Music]
on occasion try bringing some extra
air through your nose
[Music]
and allow your lungs to fill
and release
[Music]
a refreshing cycle of renewal
on every breath
let your gaze relax into the distance
or close your eyes if it feels good to
you
just sit or lay comfortably
with that attention on your breath
in and out
how are you
whether you're anxious
calm stressed
or relaxed
just allow the thoughts of the past
or worries of the future
to just float away
be with me here in this present moment
here in there now
[Music]
continue to breathe gently
and notice your body begin to relax
as you feel comfort here in the present
[Music]
just feel your eyes relax
and unclench your jaw
just relaxing all those muscles in your
face
[Music]
and feel a calming flow of relaxation
move slowly down your body
loosening your hands
arms feeling limp
let your legs be heavy
your whole body feeling a gentle weight
like gravity has increased
gently pressing on you
[Music]
be here in this moment
and remain open to suggestion
love is such an important expression
but we often forget to express that love
for ourselves
we must forgive ourselves so that we may
be
unburdened from the past
forgiveness for ourselves results in
greater love
and focus outward toward others
expression will bring a
greater sense of peace to both yourself
and the ones you love
in a moment i will ask you to repeat
five short mantras
you can say these out loud or in your
head
[Music]
and with each mantra and breath
feel yourself become just a bit
lighter
releasing more tension
and allowing yourself to lift
and float away as if attached
to helium balloons
gently breathing repeat these mantras
now
[Music]
i will allow love for myself
i will accept love from others
i care deeply for others
[Music]
i will forgive myself
[Music]
i am worthy of love
[Music]
great continue
to feel yourself floating gently
up muscles
fully relaxed from head to toe
if you like try taking a few deeper
breaths
to remove any remaining weight or
tension
on each breath out imagine any
unpleasant feelings toward yourself
just drifting away
and once again i will ask you
to repeat these phrases with me
feeling them deeply and knowing them
to be true and freeing
starting now
i will allow love for myself
i will accept love from others
i care deeply for others
[Music]
i will forgive myself
[Music]
i am worthy of love
[Music]
great job
now if you wish
continue to stay here in this present
moment
and ruminate on these ideas
and in a moment we will just do a short
countdown from five to one
and then you can go about your day
feeling that love for yourself
in the calming presence
of this moment
[Music]
counting down now from five four
