good morning guys
im so grateful that you're choosing to start your day with me
I'm proud of you for taking
this next 10 min
and dedicating it to yourself
your health and your mindfullness
today were going to start our day with filling ourselves with positivity
and gratitude
allowing ourselves to see the wonderful things in our lives
and being grateful for all the people we get to share it with
we often forget to acknowledge all the wonderfulness in our lives
as our minds are too busy
thinking about what we don't have
or what we haven't achieved yet
each and every one of us is set on our own specific journey
and in order to manifest
and attract positivity
good energy and love
we must first find gratitude for the gifts we already have
so today meditation will focus on gratitude
finding appreciation for all the wonderful
things that surround u
to begin lets start by finding a comfortable position
preferably seated with your hands on your knees
if you have headphones put them in to begin
taking a deep breath in
and a long exhale out
inhale
into your nose
and softly exhale
through your mouth
deep inhale
and exhale slwoly
letting go of any tension that you may feel
inhale
and exhale
allow yourself to come to the present moment
bring your awareness to your body
feeling the coolness of the air coming into your nostrils
and the warmth of the air leaving your nose or mouth
as you exhale
inhale
and exhale let it go
one more time big breath in
to your nose
and exhale let it out
allowing your spine
to extend upward
feeling nice and tall
and grounded at the same time
todays centering thought
is about being grateful
for everyone and everything that is in our life
sending gratitude out into the universe
for the simply blessings that
surround you
repeating todays centering thought
my life
is filled with blessings
and i am grateful
my life is filled with blessings and I am grateful
remember its normal to be distracted
in your meditation
as you continue through your meditation
if you've become distarcted
by noise sensations in your body
or other thoughts
try to come back to this entering thought
my life is filled with blessings and i am grateful
my life is filled with blessings and I am grateful
staying here in this blissful state

repeating this entering thought
in your minf
until you hear me ring a soft bell
my life is filled with blessings and i am grateful
and now silently in your mind
its time to release your mantra
its time to bring awareness back to your body
begin to slowly deepen your breath
feeling the energy
move through your body
as you slowly begin to add movement to each finger
taking your time here
whenever you're ready you may slowly open your eyes
as you continue throughout your day today
find moments
to take a deep breath
and come back to this entering thought
my life is filled with blessings and I am grateful
thank you so much for watching
hope you have a wonderful day
