Welcome to our meditation for strength and grounding
Today's practice is going to be about finding stillness and internal power
To remind ourselves that no matter what life may throw our way
The strength that is within us is always powerful enough to help us get through any uncertainty and challenge
so as we begin to reconnect with our inner selves, let us come to a comfortable seated position with
the spine straight
your eyes closed
Take a deep breath in
Inhale
And exhale
Allow the exhalation to release any anxious, fearful energy
that may be weighing you down in this moment
Allow the inhalation
to give you a moment to deepen your connection with
That peaceful, loving energy
that resides within you
Inhale
Exhale
Keeping your eyes closed
allow the body to let go of any physical tension
Relax your forehead
Let go of any unconscious facial tension
Allow your eyes to become heavier
Relax your jaw
Allow the shoulders to drop away from the ears
Just let it go
Inhale
and exhale
Let go of any thoughts,
fears or judgments that may enter your mind or at any point through this meditation
This is a moment for you to be the complete witness of everything that is going on around you
internally and externally.
Witnessing your body letting go
Noticing any sounds of the outside world as you allow yourself to go deeper and deeper
into this beautiful state of blissful awareness
Inhale
And exhale
Notice your breath
Is it shallow?
Or is it deep?
Can you inhale even deeper into the lungs?
Can you allow more oxygen to enter your body?
To bring you new energy healing and love into every cell of your being
Inhale
Exhale
Notice the beat of your heart
the rythm of life
all sing and vibrating through you
Inhale
And exhale
Begin to notice if you start to see any colors within the darkness of your eyes
What do you see?
What do you feel?
Open yourself to the truth of what's within you
Don't hold back
You are safe
You are sacred
You are protected
Don't be afraid
Inhale
Exhale
Life will always bring challenges and experiences for us to evolve through
No matter how difficult these experiences will get
remember
That the power that you seek is always within you
It's within that heart that beats with each breath
It has always been within you
and once you recognize that
You realize that nothing in this world is too big for you to overcome or grow from
Each experience is here to take us to that next level of strength power and growth
So take a deep breath in
Feel the strength of vibrating through your body
Reminding you that it is here for you to use
to overcome
anything that challenges you in this human experience
Feel it
Visualize this energy running through your body as
You welcome a powerful mantra into your mind
Repeating this mantra as much as you need
Or if you begin to notice yourself get pulled away by the mind or thoughts of the ego
Everything I need is within me
Everything I need is within me
Everything I need is within me
Feel free to continue to repeat this mantra if you wish
giving yourself this moment and silence to feel
to heal
to breathe
And let go to the internal power of your heart
Everything I need is within me
Everything I need is within me
Everything I need is within me
Now silently in your mind
It's time to release the mantra
Taking a deep breath in
Slowly coming back to this gentle awareness of your heart
Witnessing the internal and external sensations
Inhale
Exhale
Take this opportunity right now to dissolve
and let go into this peaceful energy that you have cultivated from within
Notice how you feel
Notice the energy that released
Notice the energy that you brought forward
Simply notice
without judgment
or need for understanding
Just allow yourself to feel
to be
Remember
You are safe
You are sacred
you are loved
and you are love.
Feel free to stay in this energy for as long as you wish
Don't feel like you need to stop your meditation here
however, if you wish to close this practice with me
go ahead and place your hands together
in Anjali mudra
and bow down to your own heart
sending gratitude to yourself or your strength
and dedication to your own well-being
May you have a beautiful rest of your day or evening
from my heart to yours
Namaste
