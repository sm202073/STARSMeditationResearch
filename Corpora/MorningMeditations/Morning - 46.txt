so wherever you are right now i'd just
like you to
just take a moment
to get comfortable it doesn't matter
whether you're
parked in a stationary car
sat on a train somewhere maybe you've
just arrived home maybe you haven't left
work yet
whatever it is
wherever you are
just taking a moment to sit comfortably
don't have to be fully upright but
at least that in a position which will
allow you
to find that balance of
focus
relaxation sense of ease in both the
body and the mind
and as you
sit there just take a couple of nice big
deep breaths breathing in through the
nose
and out through the mouth
as you breathe in through the nose sense
of taking in fresh air
the lungs expanding the body expanding
as you breathe out
a sense of letting go
letting go of
whatever
has been going on
for you today
feeling the
muscles in the body soften as the body
exhales
just a couple more times taking deep
breaths in through the nose
and out through the mouth
and the next time
you breathe out if it
feels more comfortable
[Music]
if you're in a place where it's easy
and safe to do so you can just gently
close your eyes
and as you sit there just enjoy
that initial sense of having just put
everything down
having left everything behind
and just that feeling
of being present again noticing
the sensation
of the body
pressing down
against the the seat the chair beneath
you
it's that feeling
being grounded to feet on the floor
hands and the arms
on the legs
and as you
sit there just
taking a moment without opening the eyes
to just notice the environment around
you as well
maybe it's the sounds
different smells
maybe it's movement maybe it's stillness
maybe it's the temperature
maybe it's the wind if you're outside
but with the eyes closed just becoming
more familiar with the space around you
and as you
sit there starting to notice how
the body feels so very often as we
go through the day we accumulate
tension just noticing if there are any
obvious areas of tension
in the body
not doing anything to them they they'll
unwind on their own
if we approach them in the right way but
just noticing
how the body feels
allowing any tension to come to the
surface
knowing that's a good thing
allowing any tiredness any feeling of
heaviness
to come to the surface knowing that's a
good thing
so in letting go now at this stage
we give the body and the mind space to
be
more alert more awake
after the exercise
i'm just starting to notice the
the breath now as well
the breath is also a good indication of
how we're feeling in both body and mind
and without trying to change the breath
in any way
just noticing whether the breaths are
long short deep or shallow you can just
gently place
your hand on your stomach if you find
that more comfortable
easier to feel that movement
and again even though
thoughts may still continue to pop in
perhaps
about what's happened during the day
where you've just come from
or maybe even
jumping ahead to what's to come
each time you see the mind wander off
just letting go of that
and coming back
to the present that feeling
that sensation the movement
of the breath
and then mentally now
i'm just going to imagine
that the body
the mind
is taking
a shower that any tension
is
being
left behind
just like you to imagine a warm
ray of sunlight just shining down
onto the
body you can imagine
that it shines down on your back your
chest
on top of your head whatever feels
comfortable
and it's as though it begins in one
place but it expands outward in every
direction
and as it does so
it just melts away
any tension
you can even
kind of work systematically down through
the body just watching
feeling any tension
melt away
mentally we
leave
those thoughts behind
physically
we let go
of whatever's accumulated during the day
it expands outward in every direction
all the way to the end of our
fingers
toes
so it's as though the entire
body is not really separate anymore from
that idea of sunlight
there's just a sense
of ease
warmth
sense of having reset
both the body
and the mind
for whatever
is coming up next
and in your own time
when you're ready
you can just gently
open your eyes again
you
