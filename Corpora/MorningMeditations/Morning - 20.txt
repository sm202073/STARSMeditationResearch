Hey guys
welcome to our meditation

day 5
im so happy you've chosen to spend the next
15 minutes with me
and yourself
i hope you're able to take this time and put some headphones on
and shut everything off
shut off your phone
close your social media
your work and dedicate this precious time to your health
well being and to finding a moment
of peace in your mind
todays meditation is going to be on finding forgivenss
in ourselves to love ourselves enough
to let go of whatever no longer serves us
letting go anything that might have been troubling you
getting you down or perhaps
sucking positive energy out of your being
this can be a person
a situation
perhaps a thought you know you must let go off
in order to contie
living a positive
vibrant and happy life
life is a journey
the good the bad the success and the failures
are all part of it
and part of your own growth
in becoming the person you're meant to be
we cannot appreciate love until
we expereienced the opposite
we can't fully appriciate
the success
we've attained before we fall
on our face a few times
the lessons that we learn
is what allows us to understand who we really are
what we love to do
and why we've been brought here in the first place
the trouble with this is that its very hard
for us to let go of past experienes
when they've left a sour taste in our mouth
or person a person that has affected us
our emotional state
in some negative way where it lingers
affects our life and relationship with ourselves
this energy not only brings negativity to your emotional state
but also can affect your physical self
in ways of body aches,
muscle tensions and headaches
so one of the biggest challenges
for us is to find a way
to release people
and situations
that we have no control over
let it go
and open the space for peace
love and happiness
with this in mind lets begin our meditation
finding a comfortable seated position
with your feet crossed in front
hands rested on your knees
or clammed together
close your eyes
and slowly begin to bring your awareness to your breath
inhaling and exhaling
feeling body expand
and then exhaling all the air out
starting from your belly
your ribs and your chest
inhale
and again deep breath in
let it go
allowing each breath to take you into a more relaxed state
letting go of any tension
in your face
relaxing your forehead
allowing the eyes to feel heavy
unclenching your jaw
allow your tongue to lay softly in your mouth
letting go of any tension in your face
and then allowing this releaxtion
to travel all the way down
through your shoulders
your back
feeling grounded
inhale and exhale
paying attention to the sensations in your body
and then as you exhale
see if you become a little more relaxed
inhale
and exhale
this is your time to relax
to be still
and peaceful in this present moment
continuing to breath
just allowing your mind to settle
remember to stay acceptant of any thoughts
sensations
or emotions that are
arise
acknowledge that they are there
and simply exhale them out
and let it go
stay present
relaxed
and at peace
with the present moment that you're in
as you begin to travel towards
a deeper relaxed state
lets take this time to introduce todays matra
our entering thought
dedicating this mantra to whoever
or whatever you feel like needs to be let go of
repeating this mantra
i love
i forgive
i release
i love i forgive i release
this is your time to decide to let go
of that which holds you back from moving
forward in your life
and now silently in your mind
its time to release your mantra
very slowly begin to bring awareness back to your body
your breath
filling your body with oxygen
bringin new positive energy into your self
slowly begin to move each finger and each toe
feeling this wonderful energy travelling through every cell of your body
slowly open your eyes
thank you guys so much for joining me
on this day 5 meditation
i hope you can carry this mantra into your everyday life
knowing that whenever negative energy is around you
or is affecting you
the power is always in your hands
love and light
namaste
