as you take this opportunity right now
to settle into a comfortable position
take a moment and thank yourself for
showing up
[Music]
showing up for yourself your mind
your well-being
if you're joining me today as part of
the boho beautiful 14 days of yoga and
mindfulness journey
welcome to day one
let us begin today by simply taking the
opportunity to check in with ourselves
check in with how you're feeling right
now in this moment
[Music]
give yourself permission to let go into
the present moment
close your eyes
let the heaviness release
breathe in
[Music]
and let it go
[Music]
breathe in peace
[Music]
breathe in love
[Music]
breathe in light
breathe in presence
divine energy
breathe it all in
and let it go
give yourself permission
to be still
to soften
to surrender to the present awareness
[Music]
breathe in
[Music]
and let it come
[Music]
allow yourself to let the heaviness move
downward through your body
into the earth
feel this shift
feel the weightlessness of your own
heart
as you let go deeper
and deeper
[Music]
relax your face
your shoulders
let it go
[Music]
take another breath
and this time guide your breath
this pure oxygen of love into every cell
of your being
let it release toxicity
frustration
pain
let it release
through your long exhalation
visualizing
seeing this unwanted energy leaving your
body
[Music]
leaving your mind
leaving your heart
let it
go
let go of all that's holding you back
as you make this decision to create a
new reality for yourself
a reality that is filled with love
kindness
joy
compassion and peace
welcome it into your life
as you breathe in
breathe out
as you allow yourself to sit with this
energy for a moment in stillness
in deep meditation
feel free to use the following mantra to
keep your mind your awareness grounded
and present if you need it
my decisions today
will define my tomorrow
[Music]
my decisions today
will define
my tomorrow
[Music]
breathe in
and let it go
[Music]
and go within
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now slowly begin
to come back to your breath
let go of your mantra
and simply stay in the stillness
this present awareness
of love
kindness
joy
and peace
stay here as long as you need to
and whenever you're ready slowly
you may open your eyes
and bring your awareness back to your
body
from my heart to yours
with love
and gratitude
namaste
