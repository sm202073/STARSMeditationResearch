hello there welcome to this guided meditation  
for relaxation and progressive  muscle relaxation training
with this meditation, you will  learn to become more relaxed   and you will learn to let go of tension  in any area of your body when needed
but before we begin please find yourself   in a very comfortable position whether  it's seated in a chair or lying down
and make sure that you can be free  of any distractions during this time
this is your time to relax and you are doing a  very very good thing for yourself by doing this
so get ready to relax your body and your mind  
settle into that comfortable position  and begin to turn your attention inward
take a nice deep breath and begin to notice how you're feeling right now
physically and maybe even perhaps emotionally
without trying to change anything at all   just simply take a few moments to notice how  your body and your mind and your emotion feel
take another deep breath a calming  and cleansing relaxing breath
and begin to mentally scan your body now
look for any areas of tension
where is your body the most tense
now notice where your body is the most relaxed
imagine that these areas of  relaxation that you've identified  
are slowly getting larger and  spreading to other areas of your body
if you notice that there's any tension  in your mind or with your emotions
imagine them starting to slow down
imagine them starting to dissipate
imagine them beginning to slowly  float on by like clouds in the sky
very good now let's turn your awareness to your breathing
simply notice your breathing without  making any effort to change it just observe
now i'd like for you to begin to  imagine breathing in relaxation
and then breathing out any tension  that you feel whether it's in your body  
or in your mind or with your emotions
once again breathing in relaxation  peace calmness tranquility
and letting any tension  melt away as you breathe out
feel yourself becoming more and  more relaxed with each breath
imagine that each breath you take is cleansing you  
and it's allowing you to  become more and more relaxed
turning loose and letting go
let's see how you can slow the  rhythm of your breath now by   counting this is very helpful anytime  you feel stressed or anxious or tense
so let's breathe into the count of four  hold that breath for the count of three  
and then try to exhale to the count of  five let's go ahead and try are you ready
breathing in two three four and pause two  three now let it all out two three four  
five very good let's try again
breathing in two three four and hold  two three and exhale two three four  
five one more time breathing in two three four  and hold two three and exhale two three four five
very good just continue to breathe  slowly and smoothly at your own pace now  
relaxing more and more with each  breath turning loose letting go
begin to fill every part of your  being becoming more and more relaxed
your body your mind and your emotions
now focus in on any area of tension  that still remains in your body  
and imagine directing your breath to these areas
if you have tension in your  shoulders imagine breathing   in through that tension and allowing your  exhalation to release and melt the tension away
if you feel tension in your legs or your knees  imagine breathing in through that tension  
directing your breath to that area and releasing  allowing it to dissolve with your breath
feel the breath in drawing and relaxation  and as you exhale imagine the tension  
draining away from any area of your body allowing  your body to become more and more relaxed  
allowing your breathing to relax your  body turning loose and letting go
fill your mind becoming more and more relaxed
allow it to settle into quiet
and imagine breathing through your thoughts  and allowing your breath to let them go  
to where you're calm and you're peaceful
your emotions becoming more and more  relaxed as you breathe through them
feeling relaxed feeling calm
turning loose and letting go

into tight fists tense the muscles in your arms  and hands as tightly as you can and squeeze harder  
and harder and to hold the tensions in your  arms and in your shoulders and your hands

now turn your attention to your whole body
notice how relaxed your whole body feels now
we'll do one more progressive muscle relaxation  but it's going to involve your whole body
so for a few moments try to tense every  part of your body from your head to your toe  
are you ready on the count of  three one two three and tense
hold on to that tension as long as you  can allowing your whole body to generate   heat tightening your arms and your legs  and your face and your buttocks and your  
back generating heat throughout your whole body  
feel yourself wanting to let go for a minute but  keep holding on to the tension when i say let  
go let it all evaporate from your body completely  drain and melt into the ground one two three relax
fill your body beginning to cool off
fill your body being limp and loose
and completely melting into the earth
at this point the ground is  completely supporting you   new muscles are being used as  you lay there steady and still
go ahead and take another nice long deep breath   breathing in peace and relaxation and anything  else that you think you need right now
inhale it all in and hold on  to it for just a minute or so
and now let go allowing any  remaining tension or frustration  
or whatever still remaining to totally let go
you feel very relaxed right now
it feels very good to be relaxed doesn't it
turning loose and letting go
at this point i'd like to give you a  few moments to just lay in stillness  
during this time allow your  breathing to be slow and steady
once again breathing in relaxation
and breathing out any tension
continuing to breathe
allow yourself to let go
breathing in again
as you continue to breathe again invite anything  positive that you need in your life right now
and invite it through your breath
if there's anything that  you would like to let go of
allow yourself to do so
and allow your exhalation to help you
you are deeply relaxed
turning loose letting go
you are in a deeper healthier level of mind
and your body is free of tension
when you're ready slowly very  slowly begin to bring your attention
back to this moment
slowly bringing your awareness  back to where you are
taking a deep breath again
slowly begin to wiggle your fingers
you wiggle your toes
maybe allow your body to  stretch around a little bit
and if you're lying on the ground begin to   turn onto one of your sides and rest  in a fetal position for a moment
slowly bringing your awareness back  to this time and place in space
now slowly begin to open your  eyes and move around a little bit
begin to become aware of your surroundings
and slowly begin to wake up completely
you will find that after you've completed this  exercise you'll feel a little bit more alive  
you'll feel a little bit more rested and  relaxed i'm just a little bit more peaceful
you're welcome to return to this guided meditation  or these exercises at any time they're easy to do
