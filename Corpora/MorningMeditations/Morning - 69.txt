[Music]
this
is a guided mindfulness meditation
on embracing happiness
[Music]
begin with your breath your constant
gently in and out
[Music]
bring your presence into this moment
arms relaxed gaze
focused in the distance
or eyes closed
just allowing your body to be
comfortable
yet alert wherever you may be
[Music]
again focusing on natural gentle breaths
in and out
feeling the movement of air through your
nostrils
or your chest moving gently
up and down
[Music]
if we open ourselves to being available
for each passing moment and maximizing
contentment
in what we call the here and now
we also open ourselves to the acceptance
of happiness and contentment
through this practice of being present
being mindful and understanding the way
that our mind works
we recognize how often our thoughts and
stresses
can lead the mind astray
digging into the depths of our
subconscious
[Music]
and possibly with fear and angst
the lingering on what is wrong rather
than
what is right and beautiful
a place we can look is to what we can
control
within ourselves
realizing that happiness itself
cannot necessarily be forced or planned
but if we orient ourselves toward
contentment
and presence
we can find peace in the present moment
and awaken to the renewed possibilities
of each new day
[Music]
and so take this brief
journey with me
[Music]
and in bringing ourselves into this
place of energy focus
continuing to recognize your breathing
and your body here in this space
just count along with me whether out
loud or in your head
[Music]
reminding ourselves of breath and body
each time
going from five to one we start now
five breath and body
[Music]
four breath and body
[Music]
three breath and body
two breath and body
[Music]
and fully relaxed now with one
breath and body
[Music]
as you are here in this peaceful state
of awareness
i ask you to think of a location that
brings you great joy
[Music]
this could be a vacation destination
or a childhood home
it could be real or imagined
very close by or very far away
it could be associated with a joyful
memory
or simply have a wonderful and positive
feeling
[Music]
take a moment to think about this place
what emotions and feelings arise when
you bring your focus
to this place joy
comfort a warm presence
a longing perhaps a desire
whatever you feel is okay
embrace these feelings welcome them
and observe them
to understand what it might mean to have
these thoughts about this place
and ponder why those thoughts arose
and as you embrace this focus
we will repeat some affirmations
you can repeat these again either out
loud
or in your head and just repeat slowly
after me
[Music]
relaxed and present
open to joy
[Music]
embracing comforting thoughts
mind calm and free
i surrender to this perfect
moment
[Music]
awesome
now in our next exercise
we will now focus on thoughts of a loved
companion
it could be a family member or friend
it could also be a favorite pet
[Music]
it could be someone who you see every
day
there's someone or something who is very
far away
[Music]
just think of that meaningful presence
in your life
realize what thoughts of them
come into your emotions
just as with the place that you focused
on
it may bring joy comfort into warm
presence
and may even bring up other feelings
such as melancholy
nostalgia or even sadness
[Music]
if what you're thinking of happens to be
far away or
not here anymore
these or any other emotions
they are all okay
because you are recognizing them you are
aware of them
so remember to embrace them welcome them
observe them
coming to an understanding of what it
means to have these thoughts
as you think about this companion
[Music]
and as you do so
bring them into your focus and let's
repeat these same affirmations once
again
again bringing that focus to the
companion
in your mind
repeating after me
relaxed and present
open to joy
embracing comforting thoughts
mind calm and free
[Music]
i surrender to this perfect moment
[Music]
great
take this place you embrace and this
companion you embrace
and allow them to help bring you into
the present moment
day by day hour by hour
at the end of this session just allow
yourself a few minutes
[Music]
to continue to stay in this presence and
[Music]
give yourself a bit of time to continue
practicing
presence and mindfulness
remember that our lives are full of
forces
ups and downs high expectations
uncertainty yet
if we remain aware of what we most
desire
to embrace our favorite places
our best companions
surround yourself with this presence of
feeling
and you will solely but surely
[Music]
discover a deep and beautiful
subconscious contentment
which can lead to the to
moment-to-moment happiness
that we so desperately crave
[Music]
that sometimes feels so fleeting
[Music]
remember this and take it with you
into the days and weeks ahead
[Music]
so again taking these last few moments
to deeply understand and recognize these
lessons
[Music]
we count down slowly now from
five to one
five
four
[Music]
three

one
[Music]
to
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
