meditation
it's all about overwhelm
and if you're listening to this episode
right when it comes out we're starting
the holiday season and so I wanted to
create something that you could come
back to throughout the months the weeks
to Center yourself
and release
some of that overwhelmed energy we're
going to start with three deep breaths
in for three holding for three and out
for three so let's go
in
hold
out
[Music]
in
hold
[Music]
out
in
hold out
[Laughter]
now I want you to think about
a happy memory whether that be of a
holiday season or just happy adventure
or day that you've had this year
and I want you to Envision it as clear
as you possibly can
what does it look like
anything that you smell
what can you touch
who do you hear what do you hear
who is around you if anyone
[Music]
[Music]
once you have that Vision in your mind
clear as day I want you to know think
about
one thing
that you can do
to remove
a little
semblance of overwhelm
I'm going to give you a few examples
that could be
writing down all of the tasks that you
have
that could be tackling one major project
this week
that could be focusing on small little
tasks each day
I want you to think about that one thing
that you can do
just one
[Music]
now that you have that task in your mind
I want you to Envision yourself
finishing it
foreign
how you might feel
the emotions that might come up while
you do it
[Music]
the lightness that you feel now with
that task has been accomplished I want
you to feel it deep
deep inside
feel it in your body in your mind
in your heart center
down your legs and your arms and your
neck and in your shoulders in your belly
and in your chest
and I want you to sit for the next
little while
breathing deeply three in hold for three
out for three
just breathing in those good feelings
those relaxed feelings
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
as you continue to feel these feelings I
want you to start wiggling your toes and
your fingers
bringing yourself back into the space
that you're in
[Music]
and bring that feeling into your day
into that one task that you're gonna
compete
and come back to this episode anytime
you might need to release yourself
from the overwhelm
I am Katie Woodruff and this is
