[Music]
as you settle into stillness
begin to feel the presence of love all
around you
surrounding you
[Music]
give yourself permission to receive this
love
this light
open up and take a deep breath in
and let it go
welcoming this life-giving energy
pure source energy
breathe this energy into every cell
every fiber of your being
letting yourself dissolve deeper into
stillness
into peace
[Music]
thank you for being here thank you for
gifting yourself this moment of
disconnection
and deeper reconnection
if you're joining me as part of the
14-day mindfulness journey
welcome to day seven
breathe in
and breathe out
let yourself release
dissolve melt into this deeper stillness
one with your breath
one with your heart
[Music]
breathe in
and let it go breathe it out
trusting your breath your heart to take
you deeper
to hold you in this present awareness
trust the process
let yourself unfold
let go
[Music]
everything in your life has unfolded in
pure divine timing
no matter how challenging or fluid life
has found a way to present itself to you
it has all unfolded through divine
timing
one step at a time
[Music]
through trust and belief in the process
of your journey
the trust in each step and commitment
you make to yourself
the universe opens up all possibilities
it shows us that each path we take each
opportunity we commit to
will always bring us somewhere beautiful
even if the road itself presents a
couple of speed bumps along the way
and through this journey of a thousand
steps
we find something even greater along the
way
our strength our perseverance
and the true realization that it's never
about the destination
but the beautiful journey that teaches
us all that we need to know
take another breath in relax into
stillness
presence peace
feel yourself grounded
balanced supported
[Music]
and held by mother earth
[Music]
give yourself permission to go deeper
within
we introduce today's mantra that will be
the guiding light in helping you stay
present
one with your breath
[Music]
i trust the process of my journey
i trust the process of my journey
and now silently in your mind as you
allow yourself to go deeper
and deeper into stillness

body

exhale
