welcome to your guided meditation
day 4
im so happy you've taken this time out of your day
and you've decided to join me
this morning were going to focus on
finding true acceptance
of ourselves
so often we live in the future
wishing for more money
material abundance
a better career position
that we forget to appreciate our present moment
and the achievement we have gained this far
its all about shifting our mind
from seeking more of this or more of that
and truly accepting
the fact that everything is exactly where it needs to be
that you have everything you need in this very moment of our life
and that everything has happened for a reason
to get you to this very moment
so find a comfortable seated position
and lets begin our meditation for today
making yourself comfortable closing your eyes
begin to bring all of your attention to your breathe
taking a deep breath in
and an exhale out
deep breath in
and exhale
allowing yourself to sink a little bit deeper into your meditative state
deep breath in
and let it go
surrender to the ground beneath
yet at the same time begin to feel yourself
elongating towards the sky
feeling that lengthening sensation
breathe in
and a long exhale out
deep breath in
and long exhale out
let all the air go
allow yourself to become present
with your breath
feeling the movement
feeling the temperature of the air coming in and out of your body
remember to be the watcher of the thoughts
seeing your thoughts as clouds
simplu drifting on by
excepting that they are thoughts
but not paying any attention to what they mean
allow them to be there
and then just let them go
know that its completely normal to become distracted
so if that happens to you
just accept it
and breath it out
and come back to this very present moment
and now at this time
we will gently introduce the mantra
I am doing enough
i have enough
i am enough
I'm doing enough i have enough i am enough
again of you feel yourself at any point become distracted
by your thoughts
or noises or any sensations in your body
simply return back to your breath
and silently continue to repeat the mantra
now silently in your mind
its time to release your mantra
start to bring awareness back to your body
deepening your breath
very slowly begin to move each finger each toe
whenever your ready slowly begin to open your eyes
and give yourself a moment to simply come back
to your body
as you begin and continue
through your day today
spend your energy
on working hard setting your goals
chasing your dreams
but don't forget
to find happiness
and accepting this very moment
because it is exactly where you need to be
and remember
I'm doing enough
i have enough i am enough
I'm doing enough i am enough i have enough
thank you so much for joining me
on our beautiful medittaion
thank you for taking this time and dedicating it to yourself
your health and your wellbing
