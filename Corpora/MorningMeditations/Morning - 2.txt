welcome
to your perfect morning meditation to
still the mind and execute a perfect day
the key to this meditation is allowing
yourself to let go
to let go of all that arises during the
next 10 minutes inside your mind and
body
letting go of emotions that stir
thoughts that appear and any physical or
mental discomfort that may arise
in this day and age it's not easy to
surrender to a still mind we are
constantly baited into a never-ending
habit loop of filling the emptiness with
whatever our minds can latch onto but
here
right now
this morning
we are going to compassionately
take our power back
and with our new empowered sense of
control we are going to let go
of everything
so throughout the next 10 minutes
anytime anything interrupts your
stillness whether you your mind or
external sources
with forgiveness and empathy in our
hearts and a conscious understanding
that letting go is the actual exercise
so without these distractions coming
forward we would have nothing to let go
of in the first place
so as your thoughts begin
to invade the stillness as they always
will
try to watch them like a cloud
as they float in
just invite them to leave
and as they do without judgment
just reground yourself
and resettle into the stillness that
you're working so effortlessly to
cultivate
so now
find a quiet place with me and let's
settle into a few conscious breaths to
establish the thread to which we will
always return
take a deep slow inhale
feeling your lungs expand
and then hold it just when you have all
the air you can
for a single moment before steadily
releasing the breath
through your nostrils with a long
exhale
only to repeat again slowly
over and over
finding your natural rhythm of breathing
and holding at the peak and then again
when completely empty
as you breathe
try to focus your mind on the air
entering and leaving your nostrils and
the sensation of your lungs and chest
slowly expanding
and retracting
breathing in
slowly
holding for that moment
and then exhaling out allowing yourself
to sink deeper and deeper
into this moment as you invite your
focused consciousness to reveal itself
with each new breath
your breath
this
moment
remember
whatever arises in you
it's perfect
because it creates an opportunity for
you to release it to let go
and find your next breath
returning to your focus
returning to this moment
wherever you are right now
knowing that this is exactly where
you're supposed to be
breathing in
slowly
perfectly
and then holding just for that moment
before action and reaction
finding that peak
feeling exactly how exhilarating it can
be
and releasing
slowly until your lungs are completely
empty and pausing there again just long
enough to revel in that emptiness
that right there
is your moment of pure
conscious bliss
[Music]
breathing in
deeply
slowly
perfectly
hold
and exhale out
slowly again
allowing it to naturally unfold
emptying the lungs
and hold
then repeat
now i'd like to invite you if it makes
sense to your practice to add in this
mantra for the remainder of our time
here today
simply whisper these words for the first
time after me
and then continue
in your mind
i open myself
to today and all that will unfold
i
open myself to today
and all that will unfold
i
open myself
to today
and all that will unfold
if and when you fall away from this
mantra remember that is the exercise
so without judgment
simply let go of it
and return back to your breathing
or to this mantra itself
[Music]
i
open myself to today
and all that will unfold
i
open myself to today and all that will
unfold
i open myself to today and all that will
unfold
now quietly
in your mind
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now slowly coming back to your
consciousness to your awareness
to you being exactly where you are
which is exactly where you need to be
i invite you
if it feels right and you have the time
to pause this video
and continue
to meditate
to sit with your conscious breath
or your mantra
and be
for as long as you see fit
but if not
slowly and carefully
bringing movement back into your fingers
and toes
you can open your eyes
with a smile
and let it deep exhale out
today
you've done something for you
you have set the intention
consciously
to make today
the perfect day that you deserve
and that is no small feat
so thank yourself
and i'd like to thank you as well for
spending this time with me
may today be the best day of your life
because that's exactly what you deserve
namaste
you
