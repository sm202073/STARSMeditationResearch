hello I'm Lori welcome to this
mindfulness meditation for staying
grounded in the present moment
find a comfortable seated position
close your eyes
take a deep breath in now
through your nose
and exhale through your mouth
breathing easily
and effortlessly
as you exhale the breath
let go of any tension or stress in your
body
bring your awareness now
to the present moment
and let go of any thoughts
or worries
about the past
or the future
simply inhaling the breath
exhaling
as you breathe
imagine a refreshing Breeze
of calm and relaxation
flowing throughout your body
bring your awareness
to your feet
visualize roots
growing from The Souls of your feet
and spreading deep into the Earth
see yourself
being grounded and stable
like a tree
imagine that these roots
are anchoring you firmly to the ground
foreign
to the energy
of the Earth
you are becoming more and more rooted
and the grounded
in the present
with every breath
you are becoming completely aware of the
present moment
and your connection to the Earth
let any thoughts
or distractions that come to mind
be quickly acknowledged
and then allowed to drift away
foreign
to focus on your breath
and The Sensation of being grounded
inhaling
exhaling
letting this feeling of groundedness
and connection to the present moment
travel all through your body
from head
to fingertips
to belly
two toes
let's take one more deep breath together
in through the nose
and out through the mouth
let your eyes open now
take this feeling of relaxation and
groundedness with you
as you go about your day
I appreciate you taking time to meditate
with me please join me again soon and
have a peaceful day
