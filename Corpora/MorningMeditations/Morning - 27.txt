good morning guys
welcome to your beautiful morning meditation
day 1
Im so happy to be with you to start your day this morning
and I'm so happy that you're taking this time
out of your bust morning schedule
and dedicating the next 10 min to yourself
taking the time to breathe to connect to your deeper self
and to calm the mind before dealing with the reality
of everyday life
giving yourself a little bit of time to realign your thoughts
to set your priorities for the day
and to ground and rebalance your state of beiing
its so beneficial to your life
so with that said
find a comfortable position
seated
close your eyes and place hands on the knees
beging to bring your attention to the movement of your breath
take a deep breath in
feel your rib cage your chest expand
and then feeling the ribs and chest contact as you slowly exhale
inhale
and gently exhale
let go of any thoughts
of where you haveto be soon
or what you have to do today
and simply bring your attention to your breath
inhale
and slowly exhale
inhale again
feeling yourself in this present moment
feel the coolness of the air coming through your nose
and then as you slowly exhale
feel the warmth of the air leaving your nose
todays entering thought to carry with you through your day
will be your guiding source for the next 10 min
I am mindful
in this present moment
everybody gets distracted when they begin to meditate
its normal tp get distacted
by thoughts
feelings
sensations in your body
impatience
maybe sounds
or even restlessness
so when this happens to you
come back to your breath
and bring your mind back to that entering thought
repeating to yourself
I am mindful
in this present moment
I am mindful in this present moment
try not t judge your wondering mind
remember its completely normal
just breathe
listen to your breath
and repeat silently
I am mindful in this present moment
I am mindful in this present moment
and now silently in your mind
now slowly begin to bring attention back to your body
start to move your fingers
feeling the energy in your hans
your fingers
feel the energy through our entire body
deepen your breath
feel re-energized
deep inhalein
long exhale out
let yourself feel grounded
and then slowly open your eyes
through our your day when you catch yourself in the moment
of stress
anxiety or frustation
remember to take a moment
to simply breath
and come back to this entering thought
just like in the meditation
I am mindful of this present moment
I am mindful in this present moment
thank you guys so much for joining me today
and I'm so happy o have started your day with you
I wish you a great day
filled with positivity
and success
