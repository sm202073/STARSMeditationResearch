[Music]
give yourself a moment
right now to settle into a comfortable
position
wherever you are close your eyes
relax focusing on simply
the inhalation and exhalation
of your body of your breath
thank you so much for being here with me
today
for showing up for yourself for your
well-being
and mindful connection
let your tension slowly begin to melt
away
as you focus on the very simple act
of breathing in and out
if you're joining me today as part of
the 14 day mindfulness journey
welcome to day three
it's time to give yourself permission to
find
stillness peace
and to deepen your connection from
within
breathe in
breathe out
we manifest and create a life we believe
we deserve
our perception of life of ourselves of
our circumstances
creates our reality
there are times when certain situations
where circumstances can become bigger
than us
and sometimes you really can't control
what life brings our way
however what we do have control over
is how we respond and react to these
different situations
that creation and existence manifest
itself for us through
[Music]
our reactions most of the time stem from
either of the two
of life's greatest forces love
or fear
and we always have a choice to focus our
energy on either one of these forces
to decide which voice to listen to
[Music]
to choose love over fear
forgiveness over anger
to create a path of light in our life to
walk towards
the choice is yours even if the
situation isn't
[Music]
so breathe in deeply
[Music]
and let yourself connect deeper
with your own heart
feel the love from within
and then let it radiate through your
entire body
let this beautiful force guide you
protect you strengthen you
breathe in
breathe out
[Music]
let yourself be still calm
and present in love
[Music]
breathe in
and breathe it out
stay in this beautiful energy
stay in the presence of your heart
welcoming a mantra to aid you
through the process of focus
and stillness
[Music]
i create my own reality
i choose love i
am love
i create my own reality
i choose love i
am love
now silently in your mind as you sit in
stillness
in pure beautiful radiant energy
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's time to slowly come back to your
body
let go of your mantra
return to your breath
return to your heart
with each beat of your heart
feel yourself vibrating with this energy
of love
breathe in
breathe out
feel free to stay here for as long as
you need to
and whenever you are ready then you may
slowly open your eyes
never forget that you hold the control
[Music]
never forget to lead
with love
from my heart to yours with all my love
and gratitude namaste
