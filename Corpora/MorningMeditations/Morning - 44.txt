welcome to this guided self-empowerment
meditation for overcoming negativity and
mastering life design
let's begin by finding a comfortable
seated position and remove any
distractions from your surrounding space
first close your eyes and take a deep
and conscious steady inhale through your
nose as you peacefully count to four
once your lungs are full hold the breath
there in retention lungs full and count
to four once again
then slowly exhale through your mouth
counting to four once more and then when
your lungs are empty hold that retention
and count in your mind to four again
repeat this deep breathing exercise
three more times feel yourself becoming
more relaxed and present with each four
count and with each inhale and each
mindful exhale
tween breaths
when you're holding your lungs full or
empty heighten your awareness
maybe you notice Sensations in your body
your heart beating with more presence or
possibly the sound of silence all around
you in this beautiful moment that you've
taken here for yourself
if you notice your mind wander or you
lose your count just smile to yourself
forgive your mind for carrying you away
and come back to the breath
to the peace and to this presence
once you're done the full cycle
just begin conscious breathing with no
retention
coming in with a steady inhale and a
mindful exhale cyclically over and over
consider that every moment is a new
opportunity including this one to choose
what it means to you to shift your focus
and direct your thoughts in a more
positive and empowering Direction at any
time anywhere in any place we cannot
control what happens to us but we can
control how we feel and how we react to
all the things that happen
just like we cannot control what people
think of us but we can control how we
think of ourselves
and we each of us
are powerful
in control
and have all that we need right here
right now
every single day is simply a series of
decisions today included this moment you
right here on this mad breathing
inhaling mindfully exhaling
this was a decision to empower yourself
to make today stronger and more vibrant
and to give yourself a gift of peace and
alignment
and the outcome of this decision is
beautiful because it will help you
design your entire reality moving
forward
come back to your breath again
inhale
and exhale
begin to repeat today's Mantra in your
mind
I am in control of my thoughts my
reactions and my emotions
I am in control of my thoughts my
actions and my emotions
[Music]
I am in control of my thoughts my
actions and my emotions
continue on your own for the next few
minutes repeating this Mantra over and
over in your head
considering the words
focusing on the breath
and if you lose your way and your focus
remember to smile again and pull
yourself back towards the breath
begin the Mantra once again with loving
kindness
I am in control of my thoughts my
actions and my emotions

come back to your breath come back to
your body
come back to this present moment
allowing Consciousness to stir once
again and slowly release the Mantra from
your mind
as your day continues or maybe your
evening
remember this state that you're here in
right now remember that within a few
short moments in one active decision you
gifted yourself and arrived in all that
you deserve
Serenity equanimity
peace and empowerment
because when the storms come and they
will when the drama swirls around you
your mind gets fixated on something or
someone that it can't seem to let its
Grip Go from or simply when you feel
like you just need a reminder because we
all forget from time to time more often
than not that we each of us have the
power to just exhale deeply
slowly and come back to this moment to
this state of being and this thought
I am in control of my thoughts my
actions and my emotions
we are all in control of our lives at
every given moment
thank you for joining me here today in
this beautiful moment of bliss and
empowerment
it's exactly what you deserved and I
thank you for recognizing that and
giving this meditation a beautiful new
purpose
