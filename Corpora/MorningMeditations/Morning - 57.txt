good morning this is a meditation
session that will help you start off
your day feeling positive and uplifted
and to have a sense of calm and
centeredness all throughout your entire
day you will be able to better connect
with yourself and your surroundings
and be able to deal with any situation
that comes your way
aware and present as you begin you may
be lying in bed or sitting in a familiar
chair or on a couch just find a
comfortable position that suits you
allow your attention to slowly direct
itself to your breathing make sure to
take slow natural breaths and gently
focus on each time the airflow changes
from in to out
in tow
when you first woke up you may have been
contemplating all of the tasks that you
needed to do today maybe you were
worried about something in particular or
trying to walk your mind through the
jobs that haven't been done yet there
will be plenty of time for all of that
but for now this is a few minutes of
your time simply to set aside the rest
of the world and become focused within
yourself
your mind may try to tell you how
important it is to get back to worrying
and stress because that's just what our
minds do but each time it makes an
attempt you will be reminded that this
few minutes this few minutes is your
time
keep that gentle focus on your breath in
and out in and out
begin to embrace this morning and this
day by feeling the energy move
throughout your body feel the stillness
around you even if there are noises or
distractions they are all ok just
focusing now on you in this space your
arms your legs the energy and your hands
all throughout you and on the next
breath bring your attention to that
space in your head right in the center
feeling moving just behind your eyelids
you might feel some heaviness to your
eyes which may remain open or have gone
closed
let's find either way remember this
isn't a heaviness like sleep but rather
it's the weight and in a way the
lightness of your focus and your
awareness it can be easy to associate
meditation with sleep because of how we
are still and sometimes have our eyes
closed but it really is just the
opposite you have a keen awareness of
everything around you and just observing
and letting everything go and just for
the moment just for this moment
now as we bring this day and your
surroundings into focus I'll just ask
that you slowly repeat a short phrase
after me
you can do this in your mind or out loud
whatever you prefer or if you wish you
can simply listen without forcing
anything continue to feel the energy
around your body like a warm ray of
glowing light and your head neck arms
legs and even out the very tips of your
toes and then slowly all the way back
back from the ground all the way up
through you and out the very top of your
head and into that point of focus just
behind your eyes
feeling light present and aware
and now if you wish repeat after me
it's five phrases and we'll start by
doing each one twice in a row five I
embrace today and again five I embrace
today for I am aware of my energy
for I am aware of my energy
three
I am aware of the energy around me 3 I
am aware of the energy around me too I
remain calm
- I remain calm
1 I am at peace
one I am at peace
I'm good
continuing that natural relaxing breath
we'll do this once again just one time
through this time and keep in mind if
you ever have a moment of stress during
your day today step aside for just a
couple of minutes and give yourself a
five-second countdown maybe you will
pick one of these as your favorite
phrases and create your own or simply
countdown it's all good it is all okay
once again with five I embrace today
Thor I am aware of my energy 3 I am
aware of the energy around me
- I remain calm
and one I am at peace
and now this one last time
just with the numbers now allowing you
to fill in each phrase as you wish or
perhaps picking your one favorite or
with nothing at all
five
for three
to
one
continue your focus your breathing your
calm and center itself
today you will recognize your awareness
with the present moment you will embrace
it you will become one with who you are
where you are and the situation that you
are in you can deal with any issue that
arises in a calm and focused manner
positive uplifted and awake positive
uplifted and now fully away
fantastic job now if you wish you can
continue to listen to the ambience just
allow yourself a few minutes to focus

can stop now and begin your day
