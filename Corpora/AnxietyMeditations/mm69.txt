Five minute anxiety reduction. 
Sit or lay comfortably resting your  hands on your legs or at your sides
Begin to focus your attention on your breathing
Feeling your chest move gently inward and outward... Your mind may be racing with uncomfortable  
or fearful thoughts, and that's okay. Just  continue to breathe naturally and effortlessly
Feel the airflow gently in and out of your  nostrils and feel a soothing lightness  
throughout your body. Flowing from the top of your  head, all the way down to the tips of your toes
Gently and effortlessly
As you slowly and gradually create this awareness,  repeat after me, either out loud or in your mind,  
each time counting down from five to one and  stating stillness awareness after each number
Repeating after me
Five: stillness awareness
Four: stillness awareness
Three: stillness awareness
Two: stillness awareness
One: stillness awareness
Remember: you are not these unpleasant feelings...  
You have overcome them in the past and you  will rise above them again. Ever changing...
If the feelings stay with you  for some time it's okay.
Time and awareness will allow it to fade. Time  and awareness will allow it to fade
Now, one last time nice and slowly  repeating this time - calm and present:
Five: calm in present
Four: calm and present
Three: calm and present
Two: calm and present
One: Calm and present
Sit with your feelings, whatever they are at this  moment, for just a few more moments. Feel the air  
moving slowly in and out. Your chest moving gently  up and down... and effortlessly you become aware
Peace will return. You're becoming aware again and again...
Remain in stillness...
and allow yourself to let go.
