thank you for being here dear soul
i'm kenneth and from my heart i welcome
you to this guided meditation
you can make yourself as comfortable as
you can right now in this moment
allow yourself to just be
here and now
observing the words i share with
you like a soft breeze
on a summer night
noticing whatever it is that you notice
your body may begin to relax more and
more
as you listen to my voice and go deeper
within
trust that your body can find its best
way to let go
naturally don't need to relax
it may be that your body needs to heal
in other ways
it's good to know that your unconscious
mind
is an expert in healing and balancing
in a safe
and natural way
while you can just flow with the
experience
change
is a natural aspect of life
like a tree that lets go of its leaves
the seasons changing
the sea
changing from liquid to air
[Music]
and become aware of your breathing
imagine now that you're breathing in
that life energy
through the soles of your feet
breathing it up through your body
and breathing out the top of your head
breathing in through the soles of your
feet
breathing out the top of your head
and out
of your fingertips
and some people notice that life energy
like a tingling sensation
or numb sensation in their feet
or in their hands or fingertips
[Music]
there is no right or wrong way
to flow with this experience
there is an old story about a buddha
statue
perhaps your arms and feet will get
heavier as you listen to this story
and you can enjoy that in your own way
because people can you know
experience a pleasant deepening sense of
comfort
as they allow their body to relax
and they relax
deeply
in the mid 50s a monastery was to be
relocated to make room for a new highway
the monks arranged for a crane to come
and move a 10 feet tall clay buddha to
its new location
when the crane started to lift the
statue it was much heavier than expected
and it began to crack
wanting to protect the priceless shrine
the monks lowered it back down
and decided to wait until the next day
to bring more powerful equipment
to add insult to the injury the rain
came in
so the monks covered the statue with
tarps to keep the moisture away
in the dark of night the head monk took
his flashlight and went out to make sure
the buddha was still covered
when the light of the flashlight shone
into the crack of the clay
he saw a glimmer
a reflection of something underneath the
shroud of clay
he immediately started to carefully
chisel away shards of clay to find that
the glimmer grew brighter
hours later when all the clay had been
removed
he was in the presence of a buddha made
of solid gold
as you continue to listen
the positive and valuable words i will
share with you now have already started
to activate a process of chiseling away
old clay of worries
fear stress and anxiety in your
subconscious mind and this will continue
with every second and every minute
with every breath
now
i wonder if you can imagine yourself
walking on a warm beach
this can be any beach you like
either one you imagine or a beach you
know
you are there by yourself
imagine walking so close to the sea
that some of the waves touch your feet
i don't know what you notice the most
if it's the sound of the waves
maybe it's the sight of the sea
the sky
the sand
or maybe it's the warmth the feeling of
sand and water on your skin
or maybe it's that fresh
clean
and high vibrational air
or a combination
suddenly you realize
that there is a thick rope tied around
your waist
behind you at the end of the rope
there is a big old anchor
that weighs heavy
from accumulated thoughts
worries and fears from the past
and about the future
they hinder you
they have held you back
berated you
from inner peace and harmony
from joy and freedom
the rope is going into your skin with
each step
in front of you now further ahead
something glimmering in the sand catches
your attention
you walk towards it
dragging that heaviness with you
when you come closer to it
you realize that it is a blade
it looks and feels like it is from
ancient times
like there is an energy link between you
and that blade
[Music]
and suddenly you notice your name
appears on the handle of that
blade while a part of you is curious
your higher self knows that this blade
is here for a reason
like life has given you an opportunity
chance a choice
to deliberately cut the rope and let it
all go
cut the rope now
let go
of all the worries and unwanted feelings
you've been dragging with you
[Music]
maybe you feel a sense of relief
a sense of freedom
lightness
or something else
maybe your body is working through this
in its own way
some people even shed tears and shake a
bit when they finally let go
the way you go through this is the way
that is right for you
and it is safe
for you to let go now
imagine the waves crashing into the
anchor
as it starts to magically rust to pieces
right before your very eyes
it is safe
for you to let go now
the anchor disappears
more
and more
with each new wave
the rope dissolves while it floats
further and further from shore
imagine the sun surrounding you with a
radiant light energy
shining down
enveloping you
filling you with a peaceful silence and
quietness
which flows through your veins
permeating every cell in your body
feel every atom
every molecule of your body
mind and spirit
allowing yourself to be healed
and balanced
becoming very aware
of that deep sense of peacefulness
inside you
as you do so
and i'll leave you in silence for a few
moments
as your body
mind
heart and spirit
continues the process of letting go
and heal
and you're doing good
[Music]
the sun is communicating these
compassionate words with every atom
every molecule of your body mind and
spirit
you can feel calm now and balanced
and this calmness and sense of balance
is going to grow and grow each day
more and more
more focused
peaceful and calm
while your subconscious mind is enjoying
and absorbing
all the beneficial suggestions that i am
giving you
in a safe
and natural way
and you're doing
doing good
you are taking control of your mind body
and emotions
you are feeling better and better
feeling calm
harmonious
relaxed at all times
that calmness
that inner peace is growing and
spreading through and around your body
and as you continue to relax
the things in life that were not giving
you a positive experience
now they seem to calm you
now they seem to make you stronger
now they seem to connect you with your
inner strength and power
whatever you experience in life you are
bigger than
that you are a part of something much
bigger than yourself
you choose to show up in your life and
honor the opportunity that you have been
given
you are pure life force in human body
you are life
you are worthy
[Music]
that you start walking forwards along
the beach
leaving footprints in the sand
the sun still beaming its powerful
celestial energy upon your being
you feel surprisingly more free
imagine that every step
every footprint
represents patterns
that are not supportive of your
intention to live your full potential
[Music]
and it is safe
for you to let go now let go now
so you walk steadily and courageously
towards your new future
after a while you turn around
maybe you notice that your footprints
are being washed away by the waves
your first steps are gone now
washed away
[Music]
let go now
and it is safe
and you're doing good
good
for each step you take the lighter and
more free you feel
walking more and more effortlessly
towards your new future
much more free
ahead of you there is a person
approaching
it is you
it is you one month from now
notice how relaxed that future you feels
notice how good that future you feels
that balanced energy
is emanating from that you over there
the future you comes towards you and
gives you the warmest
most compassionate hug that you have
felt in a long time
all that love that love unconditionally
flowing between you
the future you says
thank you
thank you for taking care of me
i love you
thank you for being so compassionate to
me
thank you for loving me and accepting me
for who i am
[Music]
the effect of these positive words will
be reinforced in your dreams
compounded in your sleep
you'll wake up tomorrow
feeling marvelous
looking forward to another great day in
your life
you feel confident to do all the things
you want to do and it's getting easier
and easier and situations that used to
bother you now they just seem to make
you stronger they seem to connect you
with your inner power
and it's getting easier and easier you
are understanding the bigger picture
and you detach more and more
and relax
more and more

solutions

and harmony now to do the things you
want to do
and this inner power is growing when you
sleep in your dreams you feel calm
strong
confident and relaxed
each day as you become increasingly more
able to let go and relax
so you feel a sense of calmness
a sense of peacefulness
growing inside you
and this growing feeling of inner
calmness and quiet confidence
is sufficient to reassure you
that as each day passes
you are more and more becoming the
person you'd like to be
