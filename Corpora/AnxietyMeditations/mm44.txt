thanks for joining me today for
another mindful tip today i want to chat
about stress a little bit
you probably at some point in your life
have experienced stress anxiety maybe
panic
maybe sensations of air hunger
freak out whatever you want to call it
and if you have it you probably know
someone that has
stress is really important to our
physiology it's something that we
actually
rely on to survive in many ways
unfortunately in today's world the
mechanisms
around stress can can backfire in some
way
so what used to help us stay alive can
often
you know the same elegant mechanism
designed for that
can
backfire and kind of disregulate our
nervous system
so
you know acute stress is really useful
but over time chronic stress even if
it's a low grade
can really disregulate
our autonomic nervous system
and that could influence our breathing
patterns
and what happens is
once our breathing pattern is
affected negatively it could kind of
feed back into that loop
meaning
now that you're not breathing
uh optimally that leads to more chronic
stress because
breathing poorly whether it's you know
your mechanics
of breathing or
like how many breaths you take in a
minute or so forth
though that in itself can be a stress
and can
kind of feed that loop
now
the cool thing is is we
we could interact with that mechanism
somewhat
simply
so today
i wanted to give like one style of
breathing that i find really useful
from an application standpoint in
everyday life
now
the breath pattern
i'm gonna
talk about today
there's
they're styles that have been used that
tap into the same mechanism for a really
long time so if you study yogic breath
patterns
you know
a lot of them
cultivate the same qualities that this
does
but
sometimes to really practice those
thoroughly
you want to be in a fairly controlled
environment you want to be sitting still
in a room you want to have probably no
responsibilities on your calendar for
the next 20-30 minutes
whereas what i'd like to talk about
today
i feel can be inserted into your life a
lot easier
uh more often
for less amount of time
so the application
um
you know really presents an opportunity
for us when we're trying to navigate
the stresses especially acute stresses
of our life especially
if
you tend towards like anxiety panic
and sometimes feelings or sensations of
air hunger like you can't get
enough breath
oftentimes what happens when we feel
that way we can make things worse by
breathing faster or deeper
everybody's heard the term you know
relax take a deep breath
and in some ways that could be helpful
but there's also ways where
that deep breath if it's rapid
can exacerbate our situation
so
this pattern probably falls under
the style of buteyko breathing that you
might be familiar with and if you're not
i definitely recommend
a deep dive in that realm
and it taps into
one of the qualities that i think is
important to
develop
and kind of it's important muscle to
flex and that would be carbon dioxide
tolerance
so
carbon dioxide is often thought of
as like a waste product that's not
useful to us
but it's actually really important
when
dealing with anxiety
or stress
and
carbon dioxide is a excuse me i got
some critters behind me making noise
carbon dioxide is a signaling molecule
that our body relies on
it plays a role in regulating the ph of
our body and in doing so
it signals our body's release of oxygen
from hemoglobin into our tissues
so oftentimes when we're breathing
poorly
because we're stressed or if we're
stressed because we're breathing poorly
we'll have a sensation like we're not
getting enough air and sometimes that
means because our oxygen is low and our
carbon dioxide is high
but
in building tolerance to that level of
carbon dioxide
we can shift those sensations so we
could shift
the experience that we have
in the moment
to what we feel like we're not getting
enough air to a place where we feel calm
and that our breathing is not a problem
it's kind of a fascinating
concept that seems contradictory at
first until you try it
and some folks will struggle when trying
this at least at first
but it works it's really great i
personally have relied on it many times
and i think it's an important tool to
have in our tool kit
when things just arrive in our
day-to-day situation where we notice
that you know our breathing is off and
we're and we're feeling stressed and on
the edge of anxiety or panic
the idea here in general
is to slow down your breath
to
take
fewer breaths
and the way i like to do this and the
way i've taught many folks where
they could successfully integrate it
is by first
focusing on the inhale so as you're
inhaling to try to take in
your breath slower
so the tendency might be to breathe more
and to breathe faster so that you can
breathe more
but to actually do the opposite
which could feel uncomfortable at first
and what you're looking to do is kind of
flirt with this edge of discomfort where
it's a little uncomfortable but you can
do it and if at any point it's too
uncomfortable you could take a deep
breath breathe naturally and kind of
reset and start over
but
think of your breath being like a wave
where you have an inhale
and an exhale
and the idea here is to slow down that
inhale maybe not take as much air
and then let your exhale kind of drag
out and some folks will even try to
create a little breath hold at the end
of the exhale which is useful but not
necessary
so a good place to start if you want to
apply structure so you have something to
focus on like a count
what i recommend would be
to breathe in
for
a count of three
and out for a count of three
and very quickly let the exhale become
longer
so
maybe
your desire would be to breathe in for
four or five but like slow that down
don't take as much air in
and then try to relax the body on the
exhale so you're taking that wave and
you're making it
smaller
in height essentially
and stretching it out
so the goal would be to eventually take
fewer breaths over a given amount of
time
by slowing them down
one thing that
also might help focusing on this
is
the sound that your breath makes
generally if you take a deep or fast
breath
it'll have an audible sound that you
could hear from i don't know from the
inside of your head somewhere
so
think of breathing where it doesn't
really make a sound
so slowing it down where there's not a
lot of
wind your breath is creating and not a
lot of sound that it's generating
so very slow
soft inhale and then on the exhale over
your breath cycles allowing that to drag
out longer and longer
and what i like to do on that exhale
is try to relax my body
so maybe starting with the stomach
somewhere that feels somewhat central to
where the activity of the breath is
and relaxing it maybe relaxing the belly
maybe relaxing the neck or shoulders if
there's an area that you know you have a
tendency of holding tension
maybe focusing on relaxing that area on
the exhale
and if you can get to a point where
you're in for three and maybe out for 9
or 10 or 12 which might take a few
sessions to to get to
what i find happens is within a fairly
short period of time
the way your nervous system feels like
it's being expressed it just transforms
so you can go to a place that
you know you're on edge you're stressed
right now in this moment
feeling sensations of anxiety right now
and within just a few minutes
um really
coming out to a different place where
that sensation has really diminished
which is an exciting thing it's like
another example of what role we could
play in our sense of well-being
now this could be done
really in any position i think because
of the nature of how this is just slowly
incorporated
you can do this while you you're walking
uh you know you're on a walk you can do
it seated
um i would maybe be careful doing it
when driving
but you know it could be
integrated in a lot of different
positions like wherever your orientation
is it could even be played with during
light levels of exercise
movement
if you're having difficulty doing it
especially if you have the tendency of
really breathing up here where your
sternum and your shoulders are lifting
on your inhale and you struggle with
getting your breath to go more south in
direction
the thing the position that i feel is
most useful would be laying prone
meaning laying on your belly
and what that does is it allows gravity
to
the weight of your body to kind of hold
your rib cage in place a little bit so
that you're there's there's a lot of
movement in your ribs when you breathe
but ideally it's not so much north it's
more east west so
when you're laying on your belly
the weight of your body can hold your
sternum in place a little bit
and it allows it easier to direct your
breath
more downward
and expand more laterally
so if you find yourself having trouble
with this from a seated or standing or
walking position then just
just lay down especially in the moment
if you're in a moment where you're
really experiencing anxiety
and
you want to see what you're capable of
doing
don't worry about trying to do it in a
more i don't want to say advanced but
you know while you're doing something
else just lay down on your belly you
could just put one hand on top of the
other
put your forehead on your hands or maybe
if it's more comfortable turn your head
to the side and put a cheek on your
hands
and just focus on slowing your inhale
and then letting your exhale
get longer and longer every cycle
and trying to relax your body on that
exhale
it's a very effective pattern
i encourage you to give it a try
practice it when you're not in a place
of anxiety or stress
so that you feel a little bit more
comfortable and then see if you could
remember in the moment where you are
experiencing
uh increased stress or anxiety
you know you could say oh i know what to
do now i've practiced this
and then go for it and then please
let the community know what you notice
so maybe in the comments
you know give it a try and let us know
what
what you experience when you practice
this pattern and if you want to learn
more about
different styles that tap in to these
concepts
the school of book tako breathing is an
excellent resource
and it's not hard to find information or
videos about that
so i hope you enjoyed this uh this tip
and if you know someone that experiences
anxiety and stress on a regular basis
especially if it's like
sensations of panic and air hunger
this is a very useful strategy
so please send it their way i hope you
enjoyed have a great day
