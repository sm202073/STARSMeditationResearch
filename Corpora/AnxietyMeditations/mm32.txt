sometimes we experience stressful
situations in our life or find ourselves
becoming overwhelmed it is helpful to
have practices in place to help you cope
with this stress or sense of overwhelm
and today we will do just that a very
short practice to help you calm down in
those times of stress or overwhelm hello
and welcome I'm Sara Raymond from the
mindful movement here we are an oasis
where you can come to tap into your
inner peace positive mind set and heal
from the stress that's blocking your
fulfillment
now I invite you to make yourself
comfortable
[Music]
choose whatever position allows you to
relax completely for the next few
minutes if it feels right to you place
your right hand on your belly and your
left hand on your chest
[Music]
allowing your arms to be restful close
your eyes if you like
[Music]
and together we'll take a few deep
breaths to start this practice beginning
to breathe in through your nose fill up
your belly your ribs your chest and all
the way up to your head and breathing
out through your nose or your mouth feel
your belly sink your ribs narrow your
chest soften
and taking a few more breaths at your
own pace filling up the belly the ribs a
chest and breathing out softening
releasing letting go
feel the movement of your belly under
your hand and then your chest
[Music]
feel as you can let go and sink down
softening with each exhale
[Music]
taking one more breath like this filling
up from the belly to the ribs to the
chest
and breathing out completely letting go
letting go
[Music]
and if you like allowing your arms to
rest by your sides or in your lap
and allow your breath to return to its
natural rhythm
[Music]
perhaps noticing what a few deep breaths
can do for your mindset and the
sensations in your body
[Music]
now taking a moment to scan your body
with a relaxed awareness and find one
area that feels calm feels at peace
feels good to you whatever area of your
body comes to mind first let your
attention rest there
[Music]
even if it's the smallest area of your
body connect with that sensation of
calmness of peace of inner tranquility
[Music]
and as you continue focusing on this
area welcome that sensation to expand
outward
[Music]
expand the sensation of ease outward in
all directions
inviting the sense of peace
to grow or blossom within you
[Music]
know that this has always been within
you
and all it takes is a few deep breaths
and a moment to look inward to welcome
this inner peace to expand
to be a reminder for ease
[Music]
now taking another deep breath in and
out
fully connecting and embodying the
feeling of ease and peace in your body
and in your mind
[Music]
and opening your eyes to about half gays
soft and easy noticing if you can still
remain connected to your inner
tranquility while being engaged in the
outer world and then closing your eyes
once more fully sensing your inner peace
holding that inner peace close to your
heart knowing it's always within you and
when it feels right to you gently
blinking your eyes open fully engaging
with the outside world yet remaining
connected to your own inner tranquility
thank you for practicing with me I wish
you a calm and easy day
