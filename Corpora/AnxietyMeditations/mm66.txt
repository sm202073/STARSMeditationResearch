welcome to the session where we'll be
doing a self soothing practice to start
settle into a physician of eve's with a
straight back and wakeful posture you
can imagine there is an invisible string
attached to the top of your head holding
you nice and tall
allow your shoulders to fully rely you
rest your arms where they're most
comfortable close your eyes so move your
breath and feel your body by that
and then bring your attention to the
state of your heart listening inward in
a gentle compassionate way holding a
space for what's here
now tuned into the flow of your breath
allow your mind to rest on the breath as
it goes in and out of your body
follow each breath attentively
silently recognizing each in-breath and
each other
who now will relax our attention from
the breath and open to a sense of self
love and compassion and silently repeat
the following word may I be happy
may I be safe
may my heart feel peace
and again in your own mind repeat these
phrases receiving each of them with a
kind and open heart may I be happy may I
be safe may my heart feel peace
and one more time slowly savor each one
may I be happy may I be safe
may my heart feel peace
you know gently returning to your bra
rest in this loving comforting space
you've created for yourself but your
breath continuing to welcome and soothe
you allow your inhales and exhales to
soothe any anxiety worry weariness
sadness what pain very simply very
lovingly let the breath arrive on the
inhale you gently flow away on the
exhale
now gently relax your attention
while growing up many of us never had
the proper tools or guidance to deal
with difficult emotions we never learned
to understand our sadness or anger we
weren't taught how to calm our anxiety
or soothe our frustration instead we
learned to distract and avoid the tune
out unpleasant feelings with numbing
sometimes destructive behavior but no
matter what happens we developed when
younger in our adult lives mindfulness
can help us cultivate the skills of self
soothing their meditation we learn how
to calm our emotions and settle our
nervous system we develop self
acceptance and compassion we learn to
tenderly be with whatever arises rather
than run from it these tools allow us to
care for our own hurt so rather than
seeking discomfort and distraction or
destruction
remember to reach for the tools of self
soothing be loving and gentle with
yourself and you'll be able to hold your
own heart give yourself space to feel
and time to breathe and become your own
source of soothing comfort as Brian
andreas said there are days I drop words
of comfort on myself like falling leaves
and remember that it is enough to be
taken care of by myself
and as we come to the end of the session
in these last few breaths fill up your
heart once again with loving kindness
now let your awareness return to the
room hearing sound
whenever you're ready open your eyes
[Music]
you
