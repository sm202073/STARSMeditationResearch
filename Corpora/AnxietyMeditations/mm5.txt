getting upset about pain doesn't take it away thinking about and replaying the
past doesn't give you the ability to change what has already occurred worrying wishing and hoping things were
different doesn't make anything actually change today let go of the events of the
day and surrender into a deep tranquil sleep give yourself permission to simply
let go into your own inner peace and self-healing through acceptance and
surrender it is a pleasure to be your guide today I'm Sara Raymond welcome to
the mindful movement here we are an oasis where you can come to tap into
your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing as we begin
to settle in for this sleep meditation I invite you to make yourself as
comfortable as possible
close your eyes and allow my voice to be your guide into deep healing relaxation
give yourself permission to let go into the darkness of sleep for the night give
yourself the gift of healing rest and know deep down that you deserve it allow
yourself the opportunity to relax in stillness
create a safe and tranquil environment for yourself making sure you are all set
to drift off into sleep
invite into your body and mind a sense of relaxation and peace
you can drift off to sleep when you are ready there is no need to listen to
everything I say let relaxation and sleep come to you
easily welcoming a slowing down of the momentum of your energy to gradually
find stillness
begin to connect with your breath and if it feels right to you take a long slow
deep breath in hold it for a moment
and then slowly exhale fully empty out
and allow any tension to melt away as
you gradually relax more and more deeply
with each breath as you continue to
breathe intentionally allow your exhale
to be slightly longer than your inhale to welcome ease and relaxation
to flow throughout your entire body
[Music] take another long slow deep breath in
pausing again and then exhale empty your
lungs completely with your out-breath [Music]
and again take a deep breath in to signal to your body and mind that it is
your time to fully relax take your time hold for a moment and then let it go
perhaps you can already feel yourself drifting into a deep state of relaxation
like the leaves being released from the trees in the season of fall you can let
go to make room for new possibilities to develop and present themselves in your
life [Music]
consider each breath out as a time for releasing any unwanted energies and
allowing the energy that you do desire to develop within you
this is your time to heal and to let go
with each exhale let go of any tension
in your body
scan for areas that are holding on to something and give yourself permission
to let go of that tension with each exhale
surrender to gravity let go of any
resistance
[Music] with each exhale let go and soften
deeper and deeper into the surface below
you
allow your body to soften a little deeper now
allow the out-breath to exhale tension
from your body
we'll let go of anything you might be holding on to from yesterday or earlier
today [Music]
let go of any to-do list that may be taking up space in your ID
give yourself permission to be here right now doing just this
sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission in order
to let go of the past
give yourself some space space for
something new space to grow into
what do you want to let go of right now
[Music] what has become too heavy a weight to
bear on your journey
[Music]
like the falling leaves it's time to clear out and free yourself of things
you may have been afraid to let go of in the past without the falling of the
leaves there can be no new growth let go
of anger
let go of guilt
let go of grief
[Music] let go of sadness
let go of judgments
let go of comparisons
let go of shame [Music]
let go of whatever is weighing you down
these emotions may have served you in the past yet now it's okay to release
them [Music]
offer your awareness now to your physical body in this moment
scan through the sensations of your body with a relaxed awareness free of
judgement
surrender any tension you may notice
soften any areas you may be experiencing gripping or holding
allow this surrendering to happen naturally throughout your body by simply
offering your awareness to your body
it is okay simply breathe and notice
[Music]
be aware of your inner physical experience just as it is
you can allow yourself to simply be
exactly as you are [Music]
a peaceful mental state and an ease fulfill state are available when you are
able to stop resisting your experience at any given moment
when we want things to be different than they are that is when we develop
resistance or tension today practice
letting go of resistance be here now
just as you are and you can get into the
flow
[Music]
as you notice your body sensations accept them just as they are
whether you may typically label these sensations as positive or negative
settle into your body except being in
your body right now just as you are
be with the sensations you experience
accepting all that you are there is no
need to make a change during meditation
be just as you are
accepting allows you to fully experience what is happening in the present to
fully engage in life
[Music]
listen to what your soul is sharing with you right now
continue to be receptive to these sensations for a few moments longer with
love and kindness for yourself
feel the lightness that has washed over you as you have shed the weight that you
have been carrying around for far too long
we can learn from our faults and grow from our experiences if we allow them
know that without experiencing suffering we also cannot experience joy without
darkness we cannot know light allowing
life just as it is can lessen any struggle and perhaps any additional and
unnecessary suffering
continue to soften soften from the
surface all the way to deep within you
release any guarding you may be holding on to
surrender to anything you were holding on to for fear of losing let go of what
could have been
let go of worry of the possibility of a new way
let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders
let the sensations dissolve from your muscles
every day we get a new chance to be in this moment it is okay simply breathe
and notice
surrender to the ability of your body to heal itself surrender to the love within
you
know your ability to give and to receive love
surrender let go and be held by pure love trust
you are loved in darkness and in light
all of you is loved simply trust
[Music]
notice once more how you feel and allow
yourself to feel just as you are for an
even deeper connection with yourself
surrender to your breath feel your body being breathed being moved by your
breath trust
it's okay simply breathe and notice
[Music]
notice the sounds in your environment just as they are
here are the sounds as they come to you without searching them out
allow the subtle noises to drift into your awareness with simple curiosity
take interest in the sounds just as they are simply allow the sounds to be rather
than seeing them as a distraction or an obstacle
if you can practice accepting the sounds just as they are without the desire to
change you can also begin to practice
acceptance and surrender in other areas
of your life
frequently the word surrender has a negative energy to it you may think of
having to give up something that is important to you or lose control over a
situation
Surrender does not mean giving up when
the word surrender is used as a mindfulness practice it can also be the
opportunity to give up anything that is no longer serving you or anything that
is keeping you stuck [Music]
consider this beautiful quote by Debbie Ford surrender is a gift that you can
give yourself it's an act of faith it's
saying that even though I can't see where the river is flowing I trust it
will take me in the right direction
[Music]
any obstacle or challenge in your life might actually be taking you in the
right direction allow the flow of the
energy of life
[Music]
when you feel life brings you challenges you can't accept you have the
opportunity to be transformed by acceptance you may add suffering when
you resist the way things are because they aren't the way you expect or want
them to be [Music]
you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the
way things are naturally there is a
possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted
and believed to be true peace is
available when you stop resisting any given moment
[Music] although you don't have control of what
goes on beyond yourself you do have a choice as to how you respond to your
experience and this choice gives you the
opportunity to experience in our peace
you can decide your attitude in any given circumstance
noticing the sensations in your body with a relaxed awareness once more
since that you now feel as if the weight of tension has been lifted and released
from your body
you sense that you are feeling lighter now almost as if you are floating and
gravity has let go of its effects on you [Music]
this lightness comes from letting go of
anything and everything weighing on you
both physically and emotionally
it has been lifted completely out of your body [Music]
this release allows you to feel lighter physically and you drift into a more
productive sleep to prepare you for the day ahead
[Music] let go of tension
[Music] let go of pain
let go of negativity and make room for
the rejuvenation of a deep night's sleep
let this come to you easily and effortlessly
in your mind here these positive affirmations as your own beliefs hear
them as truth in this present moment let
these statements move you towards a spiritual surrender allow these ideas to
help you drift into a deep healing state
you don't have to do anything simply listen and allow sleep to come easily to
you eventually my voice will fade away
and you will drift off into a deep
healing state of sleep for many hours I
am ready to release the past and move forward now
[Music]
I am ready to surrender and move forward
