take a load off right now set yourself down and relax as best you can in this
moment to fully appreciate what your mind is capable of changing
[Music]
through visualizing the sights sounds smells and feelings described you can
alter how your mind perceives any anxious thoughts and sensations
it may take some time and patience to see results but with perseverance in
listening to this soothing meditation track on a regular basis your
subconscious will realize that those situations that bring high energy and
nervousness can be alleviated [Music]
please make this time for yourself by setting aside an area where you can
fully absorb this experience safely being comfortable and reassured that
only good things will come take a moment
to set the volume of this audio to a setting where you won't have to move and
is not too loud to appreciate any
lighting the need adjusting to create a calmer atmosphere and taking care of any
otherwise distracting elements can be done there [Music]
now is it time to be gentle with yourself you owe it to yourself your
mind and body when tension builds and
can be felt it can cause a chain reaction a snowball effect anxious
feelings of a stirring and somersaulting stomach can lead to tension in the
shoulders and other areas this then can
lead to negative way of thinking and so the vicious cycle of these effects
continue to drown out any positive vibes that you should be experiencing over
time the confusion of what causes all these sensations and downward where your
thinking gets a little fuzzy and trying to understand why you feel the way you
do becomes lost [Music]
as this meditation continues and you absorb yourself more you will begin to
open up seeing understanding and realizing that perhaps you have become
too hard on yourself [Music]
there are a few possibilities of my anxiety sneaks up when you least expect
it this can be from being too strong for too long guilt from the past or simply
being in new circumstances there are many many more these are just examples
you know help this quiet time to let thoughts feelings and sensations be
shown in a safe and calm way where you
are fully in control in a moment let the
imaginative side of your mind take over as you begin to relax underneath your
subconscious will be making notes readjusting things and compensating you
with a more positive way of thinking gifting you with a karma mood whilst
deeply relaxing your body [Music]
now as she lays still and relaxed as best you can let your imagination begin
to take over see in front of you a
corridor and at the end of just a few steps forward is light take a break from
your mind right now forwards and away from yourself into the light
[Music] the dark corridor can be seen as the
confusion that surrounds the mystery of your anxious feelings and where the
light is projected from will perhaps provide you with answers to take back
with you when you do return you can give
yourself permission to bring back as much of this experience as you wish
[Music] in the distance you see blues yellows
and greens mixed in with a subtle warm overturn the shapes you see are moving
slowly or very easy on your eyes as you
get closer everything becomes clearer as you now see a beautiful fine sandy beach
that soaks up the warm daytime Sun [Music]
palm trees gently sway at the edge of this beach oasis whilst creating a
soothing white noise has the leaves dancing the comforting breeze the sight
of an aqua and blue ocean washes the smallest white waves as they spill onto
the salt and sand which glistens like diamonds in the Sun the breeze is warm
as it gently strokes the calm midday Sun onto your face and body relaxing you
slightly [Music]
as you walk from the shadows of the corridor onto this blissful Beach you
fill your shoulders instantly relax and your face soften as if synchronizing
with this calm atmosphere
feeling the soothing effects of this oasis you turn and close the door to the
corridor leaving guilt tension and worry behind
[Music]
the flourish of seagulls above you floating and gliding on past looking up
you follow with your eyes as they slowly fade away mix in with the very blue sky
above as if dissolving into the horizon [Music]
the cells around you orchestrate calmness peace and tranquility
the more you observe the more you may feel the warmth somewhere in your body
possibly a real jewel chest area of relief and contentedness
[Music]
let your worries just dissolve now as you fully absorb yourself
and become one with this atmosphere of bliss nothing matters and nobody needs
your attention right now let yourself be free and present appreciating every
positive aspect of peace that you are surrounded by
[Music]
as you walk toward the gentle rhythm of the spinning waves that stroke the sand
your feet feel warm massaged with every step that you take
[Music] noticing your feet and toes relax a
little your breathing becomes easier and worried and tension is left behind
[Music]
[Music] you will now the person you know to be
one that is calm filled with peace and content leaving all outside distractions
you begin to uncover your true self
your mind has been playing up to the situation's you have been around as if
slipping in thoughts that are misplaced by sleight of hand
now knowing that in some part that those feelings are but an illusion by changing
your mindset and focusing on more positive ideas and images those thoughts
and sensations just dispersed
[Music] very much like doing something you know will take a lot of time energy and hard
work you have to change the way your mind focuses
[Music] in front you see a beautiful scene of
sand sea and wolf filling your mind with
such an image as a positive effect which transcends to your body in relaxation as
you walk closer to the water's edge you feel the very relaxing fine sand under
and around your feet with every step your mind drifts off more creating more
clear thinking to focus on this presence travel moment [Music]
as your feet pressed down on the sand weather calm waves cycle back and forth
the warm water glides over your ankles instantly taking away any leftover
attention in all areas of your body
[Music]
every muscle is now fully relaxed softer and resting gently as you are
hypnotically massaged by every soft spill of warm white water
[Music]
looking outwards you notice the blue ocean glistening as a million ripples
shimmer in the daytime Sun [Music]
on the sand are a few pebbles within reach they are round and smooth laying
under the water you pick up three of them and look help to see again you
wonder how well these pebbles were skinned on the calm surface of the warm
water [Music]
as you slowly pull your arm back with the first pebble you place a thought
that you would like to go with the stone
[Music]
when you already the pebble and thought go as one across the air
[Music]
smoothly skimming the top of the water eventually making a satisfying plunk as
they drift to the ocean floor
[Music]
as the pebble and food disappear from sight you feel slightly more
clear-minded relaxed and a piece
[Music]
with your mind now being more serene you
begin to notice more around you where
you have been standing soaking up the gentle white water wash you can see
small golden fish have been swimming nearby in this clear blue sea crabs
tickling the water with their pincers and a reflection of the water when your
legs are another indication of how relaxed you are feeling right now
[Music]
when you think more clearly and more positively things around you can be seen
more obviously it only takes a shift in focus and
perception to realize this now these may
only be small things to notice but they help to create a fuller picture outside
in life this can also be practiced where
there may be stressful or anxious situations a shift in focus can change
how you feel and more importantly help you follow through of a more positive
outcome the more this is practiced consciously the easier it will become
and the stronger more calm you will be in these situations
[Music]
walking along the shore at the water's edge brings a sense of freedom as you
look around at the beauty that surrounds you from the lull of each wave you step
through the untouched blue sky to the endless horizon you see beyond you relax
more becoming happier inside and more carefree
[Music]
having this time to let things settle down is an important step towards
bringing peace to yourself wandering along the shore a sea plane slides along
the horizon and training behind his aband which reads relax and let go
[Music]
the plane is a reminder of the busy thoughts that once occupied your mind as
it slowly flies past at a distance being
so far away you are safe remaining calm and balanced it fits quite nicely into
this blissful setting with its hum whispering in the background gentle
waves and brushing palm trees also have a calming effect you can incorporate
this into the outside world by creating a balance that works for you where you
remain fully in control [Music]
it all begins with noticing your body as soon as you sense any tension or
different thought pattern that brings about these feelings you can adjust how
you react to them you are always in
control [Music]
filling yourself with positive feelings and even thinking about this tranquil
place that you are in right now can help maintain and ease those worries away as
time goes by this process will become quicker and easier also the more you
notice these slight differences quicker you'll be able to adjust and regain a
more comfortable state of mind
[Music] sometimes it's not a question of how
relaxed you are feeling but of how aware of your mind and body you are having
this urge of knowing what is going on being present can help in situations
with focus and balance is needed [Music]
as you continue along the coast your feet are wash with the warm salty sea
fill pleasantly relaxed with each unwed step your shoulders and top of your arms
relax down as you stare out to sea noticing more along the way
[Music]
as the beach curves around much like a Cove you faintly see wisps of smoke from
a small campfire burning in the distance with the Sun now setting with its orange
glow you can hurriedly walk around the shore making your way over to the
somewhat mysterious settlement [Music]
the Sun sets over the ocean bringing with it the sky of reds purples and
orange [Music]
still very warm the colors bring a visual representation without feeling to
your eyes [Music]
the once shimmering service of the ocean was over white and blue as the Sun
slowly sets downwards it has become a blanket of warm red and orange sparkles
[Music]
the sand that was once bright yellow is now of an orange rather looking like it
is encrusted with diamonds as it shimmers below the setting sky the
shadows of everything all now long bold as though leaning away from that orange
horizon like the hands of a clock counting down the Sun
[Music]
the campfire is now in sight and the warm scent of wood burning can now be
appreciated a weld the fire is furred water and a soft mattress bed underneath
a large umbrella [Music]
as you walk closer a sign that has been placed in the sand bears your name and
below is a letter for you to read you
reach down picking up the letter and see that this comfortable camp has been made
up for you [Music] there is no name on the letter but all
it says is that this is a thank you for taking the time to notice this beautiful
place and being aware of your feelings
[Music]
feeling quite accomplished in your findings you humbly place the letter
back and walk over to the food and water the Lok Fire gently bellows away
generating enough heat to keep you born as you tuck into the food that has been
left for you [Music]
certain warm fine sound as you finish your meal you see the Sun has now set
and the stars have been revealed in the night sky you could not imagine a more
blissful place being more calm than what it has been but the night time brings a
special quietness to everything the sky is now of a dark blue and black the
ocean a cream and purple [Music]
the breeze is no longer as the clear light sky extends its reach over the
horizon the Stars now shine brightly and the moon is clear to see giving a subtle
light to every edge [Music]
as you look up you observe the craters on the moon surface on a bed of gentle
ripples the sound from the shore your eye is now feeling heavy from relief and
contentedness you take a few sandy steps to the thick soft mattress that lay upon
the beach pulling back the blanket you
clamber in and sink down deep into its hugging material your head slowly
descends into the pillow as you feel all your energy let go
[Music] looking into the very warm lock fire the
flames magnetized your stare the boys you'd look through the flames the
heavier your eyes become feeling reassured safe and at peace
[Music]
the blanket mattress and pillow softly
beckon your muscles to relax with each deep and gentle breath that you take
[Music]
as you lay there quiet calm and relaxed
your boys close one more time
[Music]
the sounds of the ocean the fire and your breathing hypnotically deep in your
world and lead for sleep [Music]
now knowing more than what you did before you came here brings relief that
you can come back at any time taking
with you all and everything you have seen heard and felt you now know you can
use this experience to benefit you in the outside world
[Music]
with every deep breath and relaxed muscle comes a certainty but you are
stronger than what you think you are you
can harness the calm inside yourself at any time
[Music]
you will go through situations with a level head balance and remain fully in
control at all times [Music]
rest now relax more into this comfortable place let this calmness rest
your mind and body to help you awake were first in a positive mood that will
last longer will each and every day from now on
[Music] let your mind know you are in control
and that you are able to observe changes in how you feel
whilst allowing for small adjustments when you notice small and subtle signs
and symptoms [Music]
from the time you awake you will have the ability to distance yourself from
the way that you have been feeling recently close your eyes deeper now let
your body just relax and let go
[Music]
nothing has changed in the time that you have laid here except your focus and
perception of what goes on inside you are safe calm and relaxed
[Music]
slowly and surely drifting off into dreams as you relax and let go you enter
sleep willingly and invite it with more acceptance
[Music]
drifting down deeper everything fading away as she no absorbed peaceful sleep
with hugs and chose to let go [Music]
[Music]
