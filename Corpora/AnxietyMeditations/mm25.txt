welcome to this five minute mindfulness
meditation
life is busy it is so easy to get swept
away in our thoughts our minds dictating
our emotions and our moods with practice
we can learn to use our minds to help us
stay centered in our present moment
we must remember our life situation is
separate from our life our life
situation may be filled with chaos from
busy work schedules or our kids
extracurricular activities we might have
the stress of caring for someone in need
or financial burdens but our life our
life is this moment this breath right
now
your life is in your control and you are
always okay in this present moment
regardless of the chaos surrounding you
practice tapping into this moment and
you will unlock the portal to a more
peaceful life this meditation is
designed to quickly press reset to alter
your nervous system and shift to your
parasympathetic state in only five
minutes the more you practice the
quicker and more effective it can be
this is a great technique at any time of
the day when you want to de-stress and
bring calmness to your life it may be to
start your day with a positive mood a
midday break to rejuvenate your mind or
in the evening after a stressful day
begin by getting comfortable
preferably with an upright spine
feel free to use a chair or to sit
leaning against a wall for support
gently close your eyes and bring your
awareness to your breath
watch it closely without manipulating it
just be aware of it
since it
here it
you follow it
attach no judgment to your breath
and now slowly begin to deepen your
inhale do not strain or challenge
yourself
just add intention
inhale with purpose
and now exhale with a sense of letting
go letting go of the stress that
surrounds you
letting go knowing you are exactly where
you need to be
a few more deep breaths
inhale love for yourself
exhale letting go
inhale love for this present moment
exhale letting go
and now let your breath resume its
natural pace
feel the peaceful sense of calm washed
through you
for the next few moments just stay with
your breath as close as you can
listen to the sound it makes
if you lose track and get swept off by
your mind thoughts it's okay just keep
coming back to this breath this moment
this life
feel your breath feel where it travels
notice as your belly fills up your ribs
expand
feel the space around you
observe your body
feel your breath deliver life your
breath awakening every cell in your body
with life it feels so peaceful
as if every cell in your body is smiling
upon you
for the next few moments just bask in
this light of positive energy this
energy of created from within
this energy that is always here for you

your breath stay with this beautiful
moment
and now begin to deepen your breath
again
bring your awareness back to the surface
back to the space you are in

smile for a moment
smile with your heart
and now blink your eyes open and have a
wonderful day thank you for listening
