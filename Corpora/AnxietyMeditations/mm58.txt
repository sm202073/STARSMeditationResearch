you may practice this stress and anxiety
energy cleanse by either
sitting up tall and straight or lying
flat on your back
choose whatever feels right to you
hitting pause if you need to and coming
back when you're ready
once you feel your body is in the right
position for you
lovingly close your eyes
begin to tune in to your breathing
i really want you to feel a sense of
your stomach expanding on every inhale
and contracting on every exhale
doing your best to allow that upper
chest of yours to remain as
calm as still and neutral as possible
while you breathe
really engaging your abdomen so that it
does most of the work when it comes to
breathing
belly expands as you breathe in
and contracts as you breathe out
and as you feel yourself more and more
connected to your breath
spend a moment to scan through your body
from your head to the soles of your feet
moving inch by inch
releasing any tightness in any muscles
you may be clenching
in this moment your goal is to only use
the muscles you need
and nothing more
releasing all muscles in your face
your hands hips
legs letting go of anything you do not
need right now
only using the muscles necessary
and as you feel your body getting
heavier
you feel yourself relaxing more deeply
into this moment
you begin to notice a ring of light
as if it's wrapping around you
creating a column of white light
that completely encompasses your
physical form
you notice in front of you a bright red
on button
and as soon as you press it the column
of light
begins to exude even more bright white
light
whenever you get in hell you breathe
this white light into your being
and on every exhale you feel it flowing
throughout every cell and every space
between
every cell
this white light cleanses and clears
any and all stale stuck stagnant energy
tied to stress and anxiety
and it's okay whatever emotions you feel
as this happens
there's no need to push them aside to
run away from them to judge them
if more unwanted feelings occur as you
are doing this cleanse
that's just because they are escaping
do not judge them just lovingly
acknowledge them with compassion in your
heart
as you stay tuned in
to the beautiful brilliant white light
washing over you
cleansing and clearing every space
within every cell
every space between every cell
you may begin to notice a lightness
occurring in your body
as if you are feeling lighter and freer
as this tube of light continues to wash
over around and through you
and you allow any emotions that are no
longer serving
to freely pass through you
you lovingly acknowledge them as they do
without getting hung up on them without
judging them
just having compassion
as you stay present with the sensation
of white light
cleansing and clearing your entire auric
field
your entire physical body
your entire mental and emotional
being
as you start to feel lighter and freer
you begin to tune your awareness now to
that which you desire to feel
you've lightened the load emotionally
here
and now it's time to attune with
something greater
you welcome in the frequency of love
and you notice a tiny lever within the
tube of light
and when you flick it on it
raises the vibration in this tube of
light to the energy
of love you feel it
wrapping around you flowing within you
until all you are is love
you feel the deep truth in the
affirmation
i am love
relax into this
love is in every cell every space within
every cell
you let this be your truth
you tune into how refreshed cleansed and
clear you feel
you say thank you to yourself for doing
this
feel genuine appreciation towards
yourself for being here
and when you're ready take your time as
you begin to roll your shoulders
wiggle your fingers and toes
and bring your awareness back to the
world around you
opening your eyes as it feels good to
you
thank you so much for being here
enjoy this feeling and come back to this
as often as you need to
