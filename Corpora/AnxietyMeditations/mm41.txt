this meditation will help guide your
awareness to the present moment with a
smile you can find contentment and peace
when you allow yourself to be right here
right now with a smile throughout your
entire body begin with an intentional
deep breath in
breathing in and filling up entirely
then breathing out as slowly as you can
letting go letting go letting go
and do this again breathing in fully and
out as slowly as possible
settling in sinking deeper I invite you
to find comfort and as you do consider
your understanding of a smile
allow your eyes to close if they aren't
already to heighten your awareness of
this present moment through your
sensations through your felt experience
[Music]
welcome
relaxation to wash over your entire body
make any adjustments to your posture to
sink deeper into comfort to let go into
the surface beneath you
the part of a smile we can see and we
often associate with the word smile is
on the face we recognize a smile in the
eyes
the turning up of the corners of the
mouth who glow over the entire face
and sometimes the presence of a dimple
at the cheek but this is only part of
how a smile can be experienced
throughout the entire body this is only
a fraction of how a smile can be
expressed since a gentle smile on your
face now
[Music]
perhaps it feels artificial at first but
allow the smile to move over your entire
face
a smile has the ability to change our
mood alter our perspective
and bring joy to our state of being even
if it is forced at first
[Music]
as you explore and connect with your
physical experience look inward
and consider what it would feel like to
draw a connection between a smile on
your face with a smiling at your heart
[Music]
how would it feel to be smiling from
your heart
invite the sensations of a smile from
your face to move down to the space
around your heart what are the qualities
associated with a smile at your heart do
you feel warmth heaviness
[Music]
vibrations or tingling
whatever you're sensing is okay allow
these qualities to surround you like the
warm embrace of a loved one
[Music]
connect with your smile with every
breath you take as an anchor a reminder
to be in this present moment
if you find your mind wandering lovingly
bring your attention back to your smile
and to each breath
welcome your smile now to move down to
your abdomen and lower back how would it
feel to sense your smile here
[Music]
a smile tells your body that this moment
is okay as do you smile from your
abdomen allow the tension to unwind
releasing holding and tightness in your
belly with this smile it brings joy and
creates an open spaciousness
[Music]
keep your attention on your smile on the
sensations of your smile on the joyful
emotions your smile evokes
don't let your thoughts of past events
and future planning take you away from
being at home with your smile
stay with your felt experience and you
will be here now
allow your smile to grow outward from
your heart and abdomen moving now to
your arms and legs and all the way to
your fingers and toes
[Music]
since this smile radiating outward and
washing over your entire body
a smile tells your body that this moment
is okay that you can accept joy and
happiness
a smile can unravel the tension and help
you let go of negativity
[Music]
continue to stay with the sensations of
your smile throughout your entire body
for a moment longer allowing it to relax
you even more deeply
[Music]
allow your smile to bring joy
contentment and peace a smile is the
language of the soul the language of the
body
let your smile be an expression of your
authentic self
