you're listening to power thoughts
meditation club
thank you
for being here
i wonder now if you can imagine a tree
outside an autumn
imagine the leaves changing color from
green
yellow
red
brown
and as time goes by
more and more leaves just release from
the tree
letting
go
naturally
and when winter comes the tree stands
there without the leaves
some people
look at that tree and think
that there's no life there
i wonder if they've thought of
all the life inside that tree
all the processes
going on inside that tree
because when the spring comes the new
fresh
green leaves
grow out again
if it hadn't been
for the autumn being there
there would have been no room for the
new green fresh sleeves
i'm sorry
and it's good to know
that your subconscious mind
works the same way
naturally and safely
it releases
the old
and i wonder now
if you can allow yourself to access that
deeper inner part of you
that is calm
serene
and focused
in your imagination everything is
possible i'm sorry
and the way you imagine your mental
pictures
the way you hear sounds and feel
emotions and body sensations
through this process now
that is the right way for you to do this
so imagine now
that directly in front of you is a piece
of pure quartz crystal
just let your mind focus on that image
see its shape
texture
and beauty
and as you do so
there is a warm
gentle light
that begins to glow within the crystal
which grows brighter
and more luminous as you focus on its
energy
you become aware of the crystal
beginning to grow
imagine now
growing larger and
larger brighter
and brighter
i'm sorry until the crystal
is the size
of a small house
i am sorry
its light pours out from each facet of
the crystal
and bathes you
with warmth
and gentleness
making you feel so relaxed
so
peaceful
and so calm
you begin to explore the crystals in
more detail
and find now that there is a door which
leads into the crystal
the door is slightly open
allowing a brighter
gold light
to flow out from the opening
gently open the door so that you can
walk into the crystal
you have stepped into a crystal room
which is there
just for you
this is your own special place
the room can be in any shape or size you
wish it to be
just allow your imagination
to create the rule as you want it to be
in the colors that you love and feel
peaceful with
make it as comfortable
as you want it to be
it is your room
i'm sorry
please
imagine
that you look around the room and
realize that you have not been in this
place for a very long time
a film of dust and debris has dulled the
brightness of the crystal room
so that the light cannot shine as
brightly as it should
in one corner of the room
is a brew
imagine now taking hold of the broom
i'm sorry start sweeping up all dust and
debris
sweep it all out of the door
and as the dust is swept outside
imagine it being transformed
bright glittering stardust
and the debris is being absorbed into
the golden light
where it is transformed into positive
vibrant
energy
imagine the dust and debris being
negative thoughts that you now choose to
let go of
you can be at peace now
as more and more of the dust and the
breeze is swept away
out of that door
the light within the crystal room glows
brighter
and brighter
so that you are surrounded now
by a warm golden glow
making you feel safe
calmly and relaxed
continue sweeping your room till every
wall every facet every part of the floor
is sparkling and clean
clear and pure spring waters
and while you are sweeping all your old
negative thoughts
they are being absorbed into the golden
light
where it is transformed into positive
vibrant
energy
it is safe now to release these old
thoughts and worries into the light
and now repeat silently
after me
i choose to safely release these old
unresourceful thoughts and worries with
compassion and forgiveness
knowing
that whatever solution is necessary
will manifest when the time is right
repeat this to yourself
so that you feel it with your whole
being
please
feel the release
let them go
you can suddenly repeat after me now
i am safe
i choose
think positive thoughts
i choose to be free
i allow myself to feel good
i choose to focus on the positive side
of life
no matter how thick or thin you slice a
bread
you always
have two sides
i allow myself to heal from the inside
out
i choose to think thoughts that supports
my life
i allow myself to smile
no matter where i am
who i'm with
what i do
i choose to feel optimistic and focused
i choose to let go of the old
to make room for the new
i am a part of nature
i'm deep inside i am aware
my thoughts create my reality
therefore i choose
my thoughts
wisely i'm sorry from now on
i allow myself to feel light
and free
i
am
worthy
imagine now
that you have completed
to remove the debris and dust
out of the room
transformed into that light
i'm sorry glittering stardust
the imagine inside your room now there
is a sofa bed
i am
walk towards the sofa bed
lie down
to rest
in comfort now
as you do so
the golden light within the crystal room
surrounds you
bringing you peace
calm
and healing
just rest for a while now with this
nurturing golden light
absorbing whatever your body needs for
its healing
at this time
and your subconscious mind will
integrate all these positive words i've
told you i'm so
unsafe and natural way
perhaps there is someone you know to
whom you wish to send loving and healing
thoughts to
or some situation that you feel may
benefit from healing light
take a few moments now to send out
healing thoughts to anyone or anything
that comes into your awareness now
just allow this to happen
if it's okay
send your unconditional love and healing
from your heart now
so
now that you have
rested healed
imagine getting up from the sofa bed
and move slowly towards the door of the
room
taking your time to look around at this
lovely bright place
knowing that you can return here at any
time
reflect on how beautiful and luminous
the light is in this room
and store that knowledge in your heart
knowing that this beautiful luminous
light reflects your own
inner light
that beautiful
unique part of you
walk back through the door and imagine
that the crystal begins to shrink in
size
shrinking more and more until it's just
a tiny pin of light
in your mind's eye
you can access this place whenever you
want to
you can think about that quartz crystal
light
the brightness
and whenever you need to heal
whenever you need to feel good
whenever you need to feel free
come into your room
inhale
and every time you listen to my voice
every time you listen to these words
your unconscious mind
will integrate this deeper and deeper
within you
at night when you sleep
in your dreams
these positive words will be compounded
to be stronger
and stronger
and you'll feel better and better
and you're doing good
thank you for being here
you're doing good i'm gonna do a count
now from one to five if you choose to
open your eyes
you can do that safely
if you choose to just relax further
just go to sleep it's okay as well
one
two
just begin to come more and more
consciously aware of
here are now three
four
just feel more and more aware of your
breathing and more and more back to here
now take a good deep breath in
breathe out
smile
and open your eyes five
you
