hey dear love if you're experiencing
negative thoughts
that's okay allow yourself to
be okay with the not okayness
and with that energy around you give
yourself permission to get into whatever
position
feels comfortable for you
and when you feel ready gently close
your eyes
turn your awareness towards your breath
i really want you to focus on your belly
throughout this meditation
allow your lower abdomen to expand on
every inhale
and contract on every exhale
all the while allowing your upper chest
to remain relatively calm
still and neutral
this helps signal to our body that we
are safe
it's okay to slow down
it's also okay
to listen to whatever quote unquote
negative thoughts that are going on
within you
because truly the only way to release
them
is to love them
you don't need to love the thoughts so
much as love yourself
through the thoughts
a simple example before we begin the
practice
is to not think about the color green
[Music]
what happens when i tell you to not
think about the color
green
[Music]
very often when we're told not to think
of something or we
try to not think of something we just
think about it more
[Music]
when we instead shift our focus
[Music]
that's when we can start to change
but it all begins with acceptance
and love so
whatever the key prominent negative
message that has been coming up for you
is present
simply let it be
as you turn into your breath
remember stomach expands on every inhale
and contracts on every exhale
let yourself know that you are not this
thought
and it's okay that it showed up
all of our quote unquote negative
thoughts
are actually just teachers in disguise
so recognize if only for a moment
you are separate from this thought
imagine that it is just a scared
wounded part of your own child-like self
and extend love towards it
for whatever piece of you had this
thought
is likely tied to some
scared wound within
a frightened inner child
show love and compassion towards
yourself
for whatever you're feeling tied to
these negative emotions
let yourself know you are here for
yourself
you are here to love and accept yourself
no matter what
thoughts come to mind
no matter what emotions are caused by
the thoughts and vice versa
you've got your back
loving yourself in this way may bring
about an emotional reaction of some kind
simply allow whatever you experience
if it feels good to you you may even
embrace yourself
wrapping your arms around yourself
[Music]
letting yourself know it's okay
you're here for you
you love and accept yourself no matter
what thoughts or emotions are present
you're not here to push them away you're
not here to judge them or beat yourself
up for them
you are here to love yourself through
them
[Music]
as you offer up this love and acceptance
towards whatever thoughts are present
again if there's multiple select just
one right now for the purpose of this
next step
that negative thought is
[Music]
tune in to what emotions it may bring up
for you
if your arms are still wrapped around
you you may choose to keep them there or
let them come back down to your sides
trust whatever feels best to you
[Music]
and as you let yourself be present with
both this thought
and emotion
you allow yourself to get
clear on what its opposite would be
for example a common negative thought
i've experienced is that i'm not good
enough
[Music]
and the emotions accompanying our
despair
and doubt the opposite
would be that i am good enough i am more
than enough
and the emotions would be trust
optimism
practice this with yours identify what
the opposite of your negative statement
is
now identify what the opposite of your
negative emotions are
[Music]
now now that you know this new positive
statement and feeling
you can recognize that those those
emotions those statements we were
referring to as negative
were actually just teachers
guiding you back towards this
desire you have a desire to feel
the way that you just identified
[Music]
we don't have negative thoughts about
things we don't care about
they're just showing us where we really
care about something
[Music]
tune into that positive statement you
just created
the opposite of the negative statement
you started with
[Music]
if it feels good to you say this new
statement out loud
[Music]
if possible make it an i am statement
[Music]
how do you feel saying this
if it still does not quite feel true
you can say i am willing to believe
followed by your new statement
give that a try i am willing to believe
link fill in the blank with your new
positive statement
notice how this willingness to shift
into this new positive statement feels
as you start to make this shift into
more positive thoughts
you gain momentum thereby attracting
even more
positive thoughts
anytime you feel yourself slipping
into thoughts that are perhaps
considered more negative
be grateful towards them for their only
being guide posts showing you
where you are able to look more closely
at your desires
in fact take the initial negative
thoughts that you switched
in this practice and begin to feel
gratitude towards it
it helped you identify this new desire
this new positive affirmation
you also start to extend gratitude
towards yourself
for you showed up as an alchemist today
you sat in your power and transformed
fear to love say thank you to yourself
for this
if it feels good to you you may give
yourself another warm embrace
and you can return to this process over
and over again
with any unwanted thoughts
you are fully capable of transforming
them
into gold
[Music]
take this feeling with you as you begin
to roll your shoulders
wiggle your fingers and toes really
focusing on this new positive statement
and when you're ready slowly open your
eyes back to the world around you
amazing job today
it's so powerful to look at your fears
with love
be proud of yourself for doing this and
know that we are proud of you too and
we're so thankful to you for being here
we so hope this served
if you feel cold share your new positive
statement below
and we can all hold space for the
positive statements
see you in the next meditation
you
