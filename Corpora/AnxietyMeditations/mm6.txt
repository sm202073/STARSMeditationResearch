here we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive
mind set and heal from the stress that's blocking your fulfillment now I invite
you to make yourself comfortable take a moment and make sure your
environment is all set for you to drift off into sleep it is important for you
to have the sense of safety so you can fully relax make sure the room is dark
all screens and electronics are off and you are as comfortable as you can be if
you are listening to this on electronic device turn the screens light away from
you create the most comfortable environment you can pause this recording
if you need a little more time [Music]
we will start this meditation with your eyes open gently although your room is
probably dark focus your gaze softly on one point a spot on the floor or the
wall or perhaps just a sense of color in the darkness
[Music] narrow your focus to this one single
point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away
let your focus rest on this one point
stay with this narrow focus for a moment
then as if this one point could get even smaller begin to draw your focus in
until your eyes gradually closed
and you allow your attention to turn inward
[Music] invite your thoughts to do the same
narrowing inward letting the momentum of
the day gradually slow [Music]
be patient with this process of slowing down
[Music]
when your eyes fully closed and your attention turns inward bring your
awareness to your breath [Music]
begin to count the length of your natural breath in
and as you breathe out encourage your exhale to be one count longer than your
inhale
allow each long exhale to carry away
with it any physical and emotional
stress or tension [Music]
by exhaling longer than you inhale your
breath will slow and your body will calm
down
continue lengthening your exhale for a few breaths cycles
letting go of the counting if you like and simply sense the full exhale
[Music]
know that your breath is an anchor or a reminder for you to come back to the
present moment if you find your mind
wandering or find you are distracted by
sounds come back to your breath
you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath
come any sooner than the present moment [Music]
in this gradual process of slowing down
you may still have thoughts going through your mind simply notice them and
let them move on as you come back to your breath
[Music]
as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the
intention to simplify and to slow down
allow your body to soften and your
breath to be calm
if it feels right to you as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright
white color to it and it is filling you
up [Music] and as you breathe out this white light
is taking with it any physical tension
or feelings of worry [Music]
[Music] take a long slow deep breath in through
your nose [Music]
move this breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light
and making space then allow your body to
surrender to the weight of gravity and relax as you exhale
[Music] breathe out anything that no longer
serves you on your journey to simplify
[Music]
each full breath clears out the clutter
and relaxes your body and mind even
deeper inhale the bright white light
exhale let go deeper and deeper
allow my voice to be your guide into
relaxation you can drift off to sleep when your
body is ready [Music] and your subconscious mind will continue
listening and relaxing even further
like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down
in relationship to each breath
as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath
and the similar space or pause between
your thoughts [Music]
invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen be in the gap
no need to do anything simply be in this
space [Music]
in a moment now I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting
from the top of your head going all the
way through your body to your feet as I
say each part of your body see this part
in your mind's eye [Music]
and you can relax that body part completely [Music]
welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind
[Music] encourage the weight of your body to be
completely supported by the surface below you so that there is no need to
hold on you can simply let go into sleep
now as we begin to scan the body bring
your attention to the top of your head [Music]
intend to feel this area from the inside of your body as sensations only
[Music]
without moving your eyes as you scan your body simply move your awareness to
each part [Music] and as your awareness flows throughout
your body you can relax each part completely
[Music]
let's begin this relaxation process by
noticing your scalp [Music]
moving your awareness to your forehead as it softens
[Music]
notice your right eye [Music]
and your left eye [Music]
and that your awareness rest on both eyes together sensing the small muscles
surrounding both eyes relax completely
[Music]
notice your right cheek
since both the outside and the inside of
your cheek the right side of your gums
and the hinge of your jaw
noticing now the outside of your left cheek and the inside your gums
and the end of your jaw on the left
no noticing both sides together allowing
your awareness to relax you even deeper
since your right ear [Music]
noticing the inner ear
and now your left ear [Music]
the outside and your inner ear
that your awareness rest on both ears together
and now moving your attention to notice
the right side of your neck and the left
side of your neck [Music]

notice your right ankle the top of your
right foot the bottom of your right foot
and your toes
moving your awareness to your left ankle
on top of your left foot
the bottom of your left foot and your toes
and then since both sides together
continuing to relax slowly complete one
more scan of your bodily sensations from
your head all the way down your body as
you do breathe into any areas of remaining tension to completely let go
going deeper and deeper into relaxation
[Music]
[Music]
feel that your mind and body have slowed down you have let go of thoughts you
have let go of physical and emotional tension from your body
as your body softens you can make room for your thoughts to dissolve into
spaciousness
your body relaxes and your mind can
unwind you can clear the clutter of your
mind [Music]
now that you are calm and deeply relaxed
imagine a scene in nature with a waterfall
this can be a place you have been before
we're an image from a photograph or video or purely imaginary
whatever comes to mind is fine [Music]
in your mind see this waterfall see how
quickly the water moves over the edge flowing freely here the sounds of the
rush of water going over the edge and splashing down below notice the momentum
of the moving water [Music]
below the waterfall the water is flowing into a river the water here moving a
little slower yet there is still much
momentum carrying the water away this
river moves the water into a lake where
the water is much calmer and eventually comes to stillness
[Music] on the far side of the lake you can see
the still water appearing with a
glass-like surface reflecting the
surrounding scene [Music]
like the movement of the waterfall flowing into the river and into the calm
lake your energy and your thoughts can
slow down and just illness invite the
slowing of the momentum of your energy from the day past the slowing of your
thoughts in your mind
[Music] imagine your thoughts are like a leaf
floating in the water being moved from waterfall to river to stillness in the
calm lake [Music]
when you hold on you fight the current
let go and drift effortlessly into peace
that the current carry you away to sleep
[Music]
let go of any thoughts of worry any thoughts that might be holding you back
from experiencing tranquility
thoughts holding you back from sleep see
these thoughts drift off in the flow of water
they will be there when you need them in the calm state of your mind let go of
your worries so that you can sleep peacefully now
[Music] what you resist persists
[Music] they acknowledge your thoughts with acceptance without the need to follow
them off into story [Music]
meet your present experience with permission
[Music] allow your thoughts to come and go
without resistance welcoming a calmness to wash over you
completely [Music]
[Music] and now you have prepared your mind and
your body for a deep and restful night's sleep
[Music] a new sense of calmness is emerging
as thoughts come to mind you allow them
to drift off in the current not to disturb your calm state with this warm
sense of comfort you can now begin to
drift off into a deep relaxing sleep
you will sleep so well knowing you are ready for what the next day brings you
are so incredibly relaxed
your mind feels smooth and there is an
inviting sense of inner peace flowing
through your body
you are ready to rest your mind for the night you are in the perfect place to
get the best night's sleep [Music]
and you will wake up tomorrow feeling rested and calm like the still water of
the lake [Music]
you are relaxed and feel a sense of lightness and spaciousness as you have
let go of anything weighing you down
[Music] sleep is inviting you to let go and
surrender to your dreams
allow this to happen if you wish
take the final steps into a deep restful
slumber your body knows exactly what to do to
relax and allow during your very productive deep sleep
as you drift off into serene peaceful rest
my voice will gradually disappear and you will be deeply asleep
[Music] when you wake hours later you will be
energized rejuvinated and call
