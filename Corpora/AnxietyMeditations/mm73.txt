unhappiness meditation has proven to help you all it takes is dedication to

imagine that the breath is a tool for relaxation breathe in and as you exhale
you become more relaxed breathe in again
and exhale relax
next allow your breath to slow down
breathing
slowing and calming the breath
becoming slower and slower
this feels so good
a great way to fight feelings of despair is through practicing the body scan
technique it is very simple and a common method of calming the mind and body
through focused attention on different areas of the body it can be done at any
place any time and in any way that feels best for you allow me to guide you
through a body scan and just enjoy the relaxation that comes from focusing on
the body in the present moment
now lay your toes on your right foot relax just by placing your focus here
then your toes on the left foot
let them relax
then relax both feet
feel the relaxation traveling up to your ankles
feeling a deep and peaceful sensation traveling up your lower legs
up to your knees and thighs
relaxing your hips and pelvis
a calm and soothing feeling is filling your abdomen
your digestive system
relaxing your lower back as well
now imagine this relaxing sensation is traveling up your back
as well as up through your ribs and chest
we're relaxing your heart
calming the lungs
breathe deeply in and out
become aware of the relaxation traveling to your shoulders
down on each arm
removing tension along the way
all the way to each finger too
now noticing it going up to your neck letting go of any stress or strain you
have here
your entire head relaxes
your ears
eyes
who knows
now
ja engine
and your entire forehead
all the way to the very top of your head
breathing deeply again allowing this relaxation to multiply
now let's focus on our thoughts
did you know that we have over 60,000 thoughts a day you must know with this
number not all of what you think is true so
what kind of thoughts led you to feel depressed or sad
notice them I bet they are familiar feelings
and familiar thoughts
and then say tea or so I no longer want to think this way
anymore
because that's why you're here
to think positively and feel good and do all that you ever dreamed
so let's begin to implement new thoughts right now
and through this practice of repetition through meditation
you are changing what you think because you have the power of choice
thoughts create reality so let's change the way we think so that we can
experience the life we desire say to yourself these positive statements and
even if they don't feel true for you right now this is a new technique you
are starting of positive thinking and practicing it makes for perfect
repeating to yourself and changing your life I have a strong mind
I am freed from the grip of depression
I choose to think only positive thoughts
I naturally see the best in everyone and everything
I am happy to be Who I am
I have overcome depression
I enjoy life and let go of the past
eating depression has made me strong and resilient
happiness and gratitude are my way of life
when I get down I think of as many positive things as I can
wonderful
accessing these positive statements is now your priority on a daily basis no
matter how false they may feel at first train yourself to think positively
it takes dedication and practice to overcome depression and negativity and
you have the power to do it
gently rise from your meditation feeling a new fresh start on life take one last
deep breath
and open your eyes
