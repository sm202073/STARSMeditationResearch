inward begin to breathe into your heart and
into the space around it

physical body to the sounds around you and the surface below you
allow your arms now to rest by your sides or in your lap if you like
as you continue to relax deeper and deeper you can connect with yourself

moment longer feel this energy as it
grows and fills up your entire body with love
for today open your heart to the emotions and opportunities that this
state of comfort and relaxation will bring when you let go of resistance let
go of the tendency to force an outcome you can experience peace
be willing to listen to the messages of your heart without any judgment or
preconceived expectations know that you
are fully supported and safe in this space today to explore the feelings of
your heart take a moment now to scan
your entire body starting from the bottom of your feet and very slowly
moving up to your head as you see each
part of your body in your mind's eye
relax that body part completely scan for
any of the areas where tension tightness or pain typically reside
or you may notice any areas that you feel the energy is stuck and not flowing
freely
if there are areas of tension keep your focus on that body part for a moment and
breathe the idea of a warm glowing light into that area to soften it
this warm loving light will melt the tension away from your body and allow
you to fully relax it will allow the
energy to move throughout your body freely
feel yourself soften and let go
[Music] as you continue scanning your body with
a relaxed awareness feel this loving
energy move throughout your entire body as it takes you deeper and deeper into a
safe and supported state of relaxation
and now continue scanning your body and bringing loving relaxing energy to each
part of your body in this next moment of silence
and now that you are in a safe and comfortable state of relaxation imagine
that you are standing at the top of a beautiful white marble staircase see the
staircase and vivid detail rest your
hand on the smooth cool marble banister that runs down alongside the staircase
as you look down the stairs you notice that there are ten steps leading down
these are the steps that will lead you deeper into relaxation in a moment as I
begin to count you will walk down these steps you will find that the deeper down
you go the more comfortable and the more
relaxed you will become
so now you can hold on to the beautiful banister and begin to slowly safely
descend on the stairs as I count
ten you are deeply relaxed you feel the
stress melting away 9 you feel yourself
completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need
to do so that you can focus on yourself
8 you allow your body and mind to completely relax and you allow the
outside world to be tuned out 7 this
step takes you even deeper into a relaxed state 6 you are committed to
moving your life and dreams to the next level 5 as you descend you feel the
familiar state of freedom in your body and clarity in your mind it comes with
this relaxation for going deeper and
deeper into comfort as you relax further
you see a light at the bottom of the stairs 3 almost to the bottom of the
staircase almost to the light shining up at you two you continue deep deep into
relaxation and one all the way into your deepest
state of relaxation where you arrive at
the bottom of the staircase and now that
you have reached the bottom of the beautiful staircase you are completely
relaxed and comfortable take a moment to
look at your surroundings in this dream state here you can see more clearly now
that the light you see is shining out
from behind a partially closed door at the bottom of the staircase this light
is seeping out from the edges of the door expanding its light outward yet
being partially blocked by the door you
have a sense that behind this door lies all that you are capable of and all of
your inner potential
this light is shining out only a little bit allowing only some of your potential
to be seen the door is essentially
blocking the light of your potential to be fully seen you know that before this
door can be opened all the way there are things that you must let go of there are
blocks that must be removed recognizing
that there are blocks that need to be let go of is the first step
take a moment and first let go of any
negativity you may be holding on to this
negativity doesn't have to be named specifically just let it go let the
energy of negativity go let the weight
of limiting beliefs go see these beliefs
floating away like a feather being blown by the wind only to be replaced with new
positive beliefs these limitations we
put on ourselves can be holding us back from moving forwards towards our ideal
life and towards contentment
let it all go let go of any expectations
you have of yourself and let go of any expectations you
believe others have for you let go of
the need to please anyone but you and
[Music] let go of the tendency to care what
others think
let go of attachments let it all go
let go of competition with past versions of yourself and with others let go of
the idea of being perfect and the need to always be right let go of the times
when you find yourself thinking you should be saying or doing something in
your life let it all go
let go of excuses let go of judgmental
thoughts
let go of jealousy and thoughts of not
enough let go of insecurities
let it all go
let go of the past in order to move forward let go of worries of the future
let go of fear
let go of grudges and forgive
allow the past to be the past and not create your future path and let go of
anything else that is no longer serving you
be here now be present be mindful be
grateful be full of joy and be loved
once all of these ideas thoughts and blocks have been released begin to
replace them with positive thoughts and energy you can now replace these
thoughts with the simple and powerful idea that you are enough you are enough
a deep inner confidence and sense of peace is had when you believe deep down
that you are enough hear the words feel
them in your heart let them sink into your subconscious beliefs you are enough
you are enough
you are enough being enough means being
comfortable with your body just as it is today being enough is being comfortable
with what you have achieved as well as what you have not yet accomplished being
enough means self-acceptance and it is something we can all say to ourselves
more often
let this feeling of being enough settle into your belief system for a moment
longer let it sink into your body like muscle
memory
what you put out into this world will come back to you put out positivity send
out love and light radiate this positive
energy outward to the world and it will come back to you give what you wish to
receive
and now that you have let go of all the negativity and replaced it with positive
love and light now you know it is time
to open the door at the bottom of the stairway all the way you know it is time
to let the light your light shine out all the way so you can live your fullest
potential with a deep inner confidence
and knowing that you are enough you can see yourself reach forward
to open the door as you place your hand
on the doorknob and pull all of your inner strength determination then
potential flows out filling up your mind and the space around you feel the
strength and positivity flow out from your mind and fill up your entire body
and into your heart
you are now completely full with potential and possibilities let yourself
hear these words and feel their truth in your body you are confident and capable
you are creative and intelligent
you are enough and more
because you have let go of all of the negative in your life you have the space
to fill up with your full potential you
know you are able to achieve great things now that your inner strength and
potential have been released from behind this door and now you walk into this
light feel the energy and strength of your full potential surrounding you
filling you up this energy builds your
confidence and motivation on the other
side of the door you find a bench to sit down on
here you can sit and contemplate your full potential and you take this new
energy confidence and motivation and allow your mind to wander and be
imaginative
you allow yourself to be open to possibilities
you are open to change and the opportunities that come with these changes you choose to soften into these
possibilities lovingly although you have
a strong idea of what you want and what is important to you you are willing to
give a little and to be flexible
you understand it takes time for changes to happen and take root
you are patient and grateful for where you are on this journey you know you are
exactly where you are supposed to be right now in life we often need to let
go of what no longer serves us in order to make room for change in order to be
open to the process of change wow this
isn't always easy you are committed to doing what is right for your best
interest and what is in alignment with your values rather than what's easy with
change comes various emotions and you welcome them and you seek to feel them
understand them and embrace these emotions without becoming attached to
any outcomes you don't give up at times
of unexpected challenge you persevere
all of your thoughts are positive in your mind repeat after me I am open
to change
I am worthy of love and success I am confident I am diligent and moving
towards my desired success I believe in
myself and my abilities
I am courageous and brave I am
authentically me I am creating my own
future
I follow my dreams with passion and certainty I let go of the past and focus
on the now I am enough I am grateful for

get up from the bench and walk back through the doorway to reach the bottom
of the stairs as you stand at the bottom
of the stairs you have a strong sense that you can achieve whatever it is you
set your mind to you know you are capable of achieving your dreams and you
have the potential to accomplish great things here today you have let go of
negativity and anything that no longer serves you to make space for new
opportunities and for positive experiences by opening the door and
