welcome to a guided meditation on
declutter of the mind
so to start
if you are experiencing a bout of
anxiety or a panic attack right now
just close your
eyes let's immediately bring our
attention
out of the feeling and anxiety of this
attack
and bring our attention into the
physical
breathe in the way that you need to
breathe right now
but bring your attention
to the physical
to your body making contact with the
floor or chair
and just know that
you will be okay
and this too will pass
we just need to gently ground our
attention right now and something
other than our thoughts
so you can put your hands in your lap
and
notice your hands resting there
allow your fingers to
touch and
drill down your awareness on the fingers
let's continue to ground
our attention here
and notice the weight of your body on
the floor or on the chair
noticing gravity
and sinking our awareness into the
physical sensations you notice here
taking our minds out of
feelings and thoughts and
into the body
and if your mind wanders
simply bring it back to the body
without judgment
or frustration
or adding more thoughts here
and now with our eyes closed
let's start a breathing practice
let's begin to wind down from our
previous state
so we're going to breathe in for four
seconds
pause and hold for one second
and then breathe out for four seconds
and there's no need to be perfect here
just try to follow the prompts as much
as you can
so breathing in
one
two
three
four
hold for one
and breathe out
one
two
three
four
so let's do another
breathing in
one
two
three
four
holding for one
and then breathing out
one
two
three
four
and now see if you can maintain this
breathing rhythm on your own
for the next few moments
and again no need to be perfect here
the less effort the better
and now allow your body to breathe
on its own
whatever way is comfortable for you to
breathe in return to that
and when you do let's start by
practicing some mindfulness here
so we're going to watch the breath for
the next few moments
we're not going to change anything about
the breath or
add anything here
we're just using the breath as an anchor
for our awareness
while noticing the thoughts and feelings
that come and go through the mind
so while you watch the breath
a thought of panic or
anxiety may arise
and then we just simply notice it
without any judgment or
following it with more thinking
and then gently returning our attention
to the breath again
so let's watch the breath with an open
awareness for the next few moments
and if you find that your mind
has wandered and become lost in thought
bring it back gently to the breath
and as we watch the breath we can count
the breaths just to ground our attention
on the breath
a little more
so count the in-breath one
the out-breath two
until we reach a count of ten
and then begin the count again
and now in the final few moments
just allow yourself to let go of any
attempt here
let's allow the mind to do what it wants
for the next few moments
and now
open your eyes
you've just completed the practice
thanks for sitting
and i'll see you next time
thanks again for taking the time to
practice
