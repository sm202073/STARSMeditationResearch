good morning
my name is kate waitskin and this is a
brief meditation designed to help you
move into your day with greater clarity
and stability
and presence
so please find a comfortable seat with
your spine tall
go ahead and close your eyes
and to begin
just notice where you are in space
so are you
unconsciously leaning forward in your
seat
or leaning back
are you shifted toward the left or to
the right
and do your best to find the very center
of your seat
and align the crown of your head over
the bowl of your pelvis
bring your palms together in front of
your heart and take one deep breath
to welcome yourself to your day
release your hands down to your thighs
with your palms facing down
and take a moment to notice what is
present for you this morning as you
begin your day
without any judgment or analyzation
simply observe
how do you feel and your physical body
what is the quality of your breath
and how is it moving for you this
morning
how do you feel energetically
and what thoughts
and emotions may be highlighted and
present for you this morning
now please take one deep breath in
through your nose
all the way down into your belly
and as you exhale release your breath
now through your mouth
and repeat this
once more draw your breath in through
your nose
and release out through your mouth
now gently seal your lips
and breathe naturally in and out through
your nose
and we'll shift now into a visualization
combined with a shaping of the breath
so please bring your awareness to the
base of your spine
and visualize in this space a sphere of
golden light
vibrant
and luminous
and as you take a slow deep breath in
now
imagine this light traveling up the
center of your body
coming to rest or float at the crown of
your head
pause here momentarily holding your
awareness in this light
[Music]
and now as you exhale allow your breath
to guide this light down the central
channel of your body
until it comes to rest once again at the
base of your spine
[Music]
please repeat this pattern
so as you inhale
see this sphere of golden light
traveling up the center of your body
coming to rest at your crown
a gentle pause as you hold your
awareness in this vibrant light
and as you exhale
see the light descend down the length of
your spine
coming to rest at your base once again
so continue a few more rounds just like
this
your breath smooth and effortless
guides this light
through the center of your body
a momentary gentle pause at the top of
your inhale
you continue with this natural cadence
and rhythm of your own breath
this measured rhythm of your breath
naturally cultivates a steady
grounded focus
as this light washes through your inner
body
begin to sense a cleansing and a
clearing
of any stagnant energy
and distraction from your previous day
or your night of sleep
like a healing ball moving through your
body
sense this light creating space
ease
and clarity
at the top of your next inhale
pause this sphere of light
in the space of your mid brain
just below your crown
continue to breathe naturally
as you rest your awareness
your committed gentle focus in this
light
spacious and clear
hold your vision for your day ahead in
this space
how will you feel in your body
what is the quality of energy you will
bring to your interactions and your
experiences today
how will you bring more presence and
connection
into your day
and finally consider offering a prayer
or intention into this light of focus
hold this clear vision steady in your
mind's eye
[Music]
now please bring your awareness back to
your breath
notice the natural movements of your
body with each inhale and each exhale
bring your awareness to the points of
contact between your physical body and
the support beneath you
and sense this support rising to meet
you
offering a steady foundation for your
day
and as you're ready bring your palms
together at your heart center
gently bow your head towards your heart
take a moment of gratitude for your body
your breath
and the gift of this day
you
