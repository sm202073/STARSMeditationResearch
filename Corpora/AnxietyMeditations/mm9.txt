I will be guiding you to be an
observer of where you are in this
present moment to slow down and go
within to be curious about your physical
sensations as well as your emotional
well-being oftentimes all it takes is
stepping back from a situation where the
habit is reaction so you can simply be
aware of a moment and respond more in
alignment with your true self and what
is important to you you can see the
present moment for what it is and Trust
the journey
I invite you to make yourself
comfortable and find a posture of
effortless ease where you can be relaxed
yet alert you may choose to lie down or
sit up when you are comfortable close
your eyes or soften your gaze to bring
your attention inward as you settle into
comfort bring your attention to your
breath in a moment I will guide you to
take several deep breaths
counting your inhale and making your
exhale one count longer than your inhale
before you do this first observe the
quality of the state you are in without
making any changes or judging where you
are just check in are you calm
what is your heart rate like in this
moment
what is the depth of your natural breath
what are the sensations you are
experiencing in your body
are you warm or cool
what else is your attention drawn to as
an observer of your state
after noticing your current state begin
to mindfully inhale and count the length
of this breath then extend your exhale
one count longer than your inhale and
practice this for the next few moments
let go of this counting breath and allow
your breathing to return to its natural
pace and then scan your body once more
what is there for you now
are there any differences in the quality
of your state
your heart rate
or the sensations in your body
now look for anywhere that you can let
go of the tendency to hold on is there
anywhere in your physical body that you
can let go
or any emotions that you are holding on
to let them go to let go of tension
let go of tightness or pain
let go of the need to control or hold
your posture
often we are in fight-or-flight mode or
under physical or emotional stress and
we aren't even aware of it today right
now I invite you to find more ease
can you let go of stress and welcome
yourself into the rest and digest mode
what would it feel like in your body to
experience peace to find calm to be
still
breathe this in experience this right
now
the stillness this calm state is a time
to go within much like winter is a time
of unseen growth a time of presumed
dormant life or inactivity trust your
journey Trust the journey of the seasons
winter is a time to turn inward to
connect with yourself to be curious
about what is there for you you may
sense the need to slow down to lower the
intensity to rest and prepare for what
is to come
listen to your body to your instincts
what is there for you right now
the symbolism of winter invites us to
quiet the mind it invites us to wrap up
in warmth and find stillness of our soul
to seek out serenity
this is a time of introversion
contemplation and going within
see the still state of the life in this
season and trust that there will be
growth once more see the blessing in the
quiet and calm of the winter see the
hope for the future of the seasons to
come
as you look inward what is there for you
right now
life nature and every person experiences
a natural ebb and flow an inhalation
period as well as an exhalation period
life is the balance of giving and
receiving of expending energy and
conserving energy during the winter
season it is a time to withdraw conserve
and rest the expenditure of energy is
minimal
this is the season that we experienced
the longest day of the year and then the
return of the light and the lengthening
of daylight it is the season during
which our energies are naturally drawn
inward when we are inclined to be more
contemplative give yourself permission
to slow down to dream to go within
your dreams may be blurry and not fully
formed right now plant the seeds of
intention for your dreams then open your
field of awareness and look for signs
look for your dreams to solidify in time
be open to the possibilities as they
arise as you take your winter season to
rest and go inward invite yourself to
dream
dream of the person you would like to be
dream of the qualities you would like to
embody
dream of your intentions
dream of your ideal life
letting your imagination run wild with
all your senses as if your dream came
true in this present moment feel it in
your body as if it were true
you may see this dream this ideal life
in your mind or simply experience the
energy of this dream what is coming up
for you now
breathe this in now
plant the seeds for this life now
out of these intentions and dreams will
come beauty in the seasons ahead
out of the stillness and peace will come
a balance of energy an exhalation period
be patient and listen to what your body
is telling you now listen to what your
soul needs now
[Music]
sit with these dreams and intentions for
a few minutes longer feel that they are
there within you preparing for the
future even in this time of stillness
take in another deep breath as you bring
your awareness to the sensations of your
body and the energy of your surroundings
since the energy building within you
once more
knowing that out of this time of
stillness comes growth you have taken
this time to go inward to dream to
solidify your intentions when you are
ready open your eyes open to the
possibilities of what these intentions
will bring open your field of awareness
now trust the journey listen observe and
be patient look for the seasons to
change the energy to shift trust the
journey
[Music]
the love and light and me honors the
love and light in you
