our current culture is
fast-paced and frequently very demanding
not allowing for very much downtime to
recover
it's not surprising that many of us have
experienced stress overwhelm and anxiety
at some point in our lives these
feelings are often caused by the racing
and overactive thoughts of our mind
meditation is a wonderful tool to help
quiet the busy mind in the moment and
also to practice being able to balance
and Center our emotions for future
situations you have already taken the
most difficult step to helping yourself
you have chosen to take time to practice
this guided meditation let's begin find
a posture of comfort
sit or lie down so you can experience
ease in your body which will allow for
ease in your mind we will start this
meditation with your eyes open gently
focus your line of vision on one point
in front of you you can find a spot on
the floor or the wall
and now narrow your focus to this one
single point and allow everything in the
background to blur or fade away see all
that you can see about this one single
point
now slowly broaden your field of view
like a camera lens widening with a
relaxed awareness notice everything you
can see in your current much broader
line of you without having to turn your
head what colors
textures and materials do you see do you
see brightness or dim light around you
[Music]
take it all in
once more slowly narrow your field of
view to the same single point
as your focus narrows continue to draw
it in until your eyes gradually closed
and you invite your attention to turn
inward
and now start to notice the natural
rhythm and depth of your breath
without making any changes just notice
listen to the sound of your breath
look for any movement of your body that
is connected to your breath
[Music]
and now intentionally begin to deepen
each breath in and slow down on your
exhale as you slow down and deepen your
breath take time to notice all there is
to experience about your breath
[Music]
and explore how your breath might change
slightly as you continue to look inward
[Music]
simply notice the experience of your
breath without expectations and without
judgments
what would it be like to offer your
breath some love and compassion
like your breath slowing down your mind
to can slow down in relationship to each
breath as your breath and your mind slow
notice the space between each breath and
the similar space or pause between your
thoughts invite this gap between breaths
and thoughts to lengthen
be in the gap
no need to do anything simply be in this
space without expectations what do you
notice in stillness
[Music]
this is a judgment-free practice of
allowing what is there to come to the
surface with curiosity
[Music]
[Music]
if you find your mind wandering or your
sense of calm begin to dissipate come
back to your breath
and the gap between thoughts
[Music]
when we slow down we notice more
when we are in the gap we notice what we
might otherwise be missing when we rush
or overthink experience your body being
breathed and let your attention rest on
the space between breath and thought
[Music]
now broaden your awareness to the
physical experience of your body
look inside and since the energy and
feelings of one single point at the area
of your stomach what do you notice at
this one small focal point
[Music]
similar to broadening your visual focal
point begin to widen the experience of
your sensations moving outward from your
stomach notice where your body makes a
connection with the surface below you
perhaps you sense there is a blurring of
the lines that separate you from the
support and from the energy around you
or maybe you feel pressure or warmth at
this connection continue gradually
moving this relaxed scan of your body
helped from your Center notice if there
are any parts that are making contact
with another part of your body
[Music]
awaken to the sensations in your body
moving out from your Center now since
the aliveness in your hands and in your
feet
[Music]
feel the energy moving within you
[Music]
inhabit your body fully when we can do
this live in this body sense our own
aliveness we are in the present and
living in the space between our thoughts
when your mind is attentive to the
sensations of your body
you can pause you can extend the gap
between your thoughts
this gap is where you can experience
peace and calm
notice now if there is anywhere you can
soften a little bit more look for any
where you can let go even deeper into
relaxation and ease let your physical
body go so that you can let your
thoughts go
[Music]
imagine your thoughts are like a river
flowing gently downstream
let your thoughts go so you can be here
now awake to the sensations in your body
[Music]
what would it be like to relax a tense
muscle right now
what would it feel like to let go of
tension and tightness
look inside for any areas of your body
that are telling you something
sometimes the simple act of attending to
a sensation allows it to soften or fade
away our body wants to be heard to be
recognized
[Music]
invite your attention to move to the
areas of your body that are telling you
something
and feel the sensations there quiet your
thoughts to hear the sensations
[Music]
if you find your mind drifting going
back to old patterns of thinking or
overthinking lovingly come back
gesture your attention to come back to
the sensations once more stay with the
experience of your sensations as they
arise for a moment longer
knowing that you can always come back to
this state of quiet because it has
always been a part of you
[Music]
[Music]
take another full breath in
and let it out as slowly as you can and
do this again letting go of your breath
letting go of tension letting go of your
busy mind
as you brought in your field of
awareness once more look for habits or
recurring tendencies that you may have
to leave your body and come back as many
times as you need start over with you're
aware presence
in life outside of meditation look for
patterns when you might be rushing and
come back to experience life fully when
we slow down and stay with the
sensations as long as we can we notice
more we live more fully when we are
trying to control our life to make it
just the way we want it to be perfect
we are not experiencing all that life
has to offer listen to what wants to be
heard see what wants to be seen to do
this slow down
cause in the gap between thoughts quiet
our thoughts to see hear and feel deeply
and have it your body fully and be open
to life
when you were already open your eyes I
hope you have a peaceful and calm day
thank you for practicing with me
