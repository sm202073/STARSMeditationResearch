[Applause] release worries guided meditation for a
deep sleep hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this gentle
end to your day you are listening to a meditation to let go of your worries
before falling into an effortless peaceful sleep over the course of the
next 30 minutes or so you'll have an opportunity journey into relaxation
letting go of the daily things that weigh down your body mind and spirit
before we begin take a moment to let go of the need for this meditation to have
a certain outcome perhaps you will fall asleep during this recording or maybe
you will emerge so deeply relaxed free of all stress that it feels like you
have had a wonderfully restoring nap the
outcome does not matter all that counts is your carefree exploration of serenity
you are here in this moment it's yours
to embrace
so taking in a deep breath now breathing in through your nose hold it for a
second and release slowly releasing all
the stress and tension through your nose or mouth
and another breath in breathing in through the nose filling your diaphragm
hold and release let go notice the way
your body feels after this deep inhalation and exhalation do you feel
any tension or pain in your body are you alert tied content just give yourself a
moment to reconnect with your body which may be subservient to your brain during
your waking life [Music]
[Music]
begin now by returning your breathing back to its natural rhythm nothing
forced nothing strained it just is what it is and when you are ready notice
yourself beginning to feel a little heavier the way you might feel if you
spent the afternoon laying in the Sun or when you've taken a long soak in a hot bath your eyelids begin to droop
slipping further away with each breath
take this opportunity now to make sure everything is in order before we truly
begin this meditation if you haven't already set an alarm and you need to do
that just do that now and make sure your cell phone notifications are silenced
and the top lines are drawn [Music]
give yourself now permission to embrace the sensations in your body
however comfortable or tense they may be do not force yourself to change anything
but it be spontaneous and easy do not
need to strive to succeed here in this place and in every place you are perfect
just as you are each of us is perfect and each of us needs a little work let
this realization seep into you replacing anything you worry about with a calmness
that permeates every fiber of your being [Music]
whatever you are feeling can change and you have the power to feel just the way
you want to this is you here in the
moment and you do not have to be perfect to be magnificent meditation is a
journey just as sleep is a journey and you do not need to concern yourself with
reaching any fixed destination instead
enjoy each breath each soft inhale and
exhale as you find yourself drawn deeper and deeper into a relaxation more
profound than you could have ever hoped for
allow all your thoughts from your day begin to melt away replaced by a sense
of effortless calm even though thoughts
may appear in your mind's eye they do not stay long but just allow them to
float by to dissolve leaving you in a
heightened sense of peace and gentle awareness they are just like dust washed
clean by the rain disappearing under the gentle touch of your slow inhale and
exhale everything you are worried about
from the profound to the everyday drifts away leaving you an increasingly
soothing state of tranquillity [Music]
if any other worries arise during the course of this meditation you may simply
let them dissolve away leaving you
cleansed and refreshed this is time for you three from the concerns of everyday
life just use these next few moments now
to simply be focusing on your breathing
breathing in and out in your own natural rhythm thoughts may come and go and
simply allow them to drift on by no need
to be connected to anything [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you
[Music]
as you feel your body growing heavier more restful and your thoughts softening
into a quiet chatter in the background your imagination comes to life visualize
yourself standing in a meadow on a brilliantly warm sunny day wildflowers
of all shapes sizes and colors punctuate the soft grass butterflies some small
some larger flutter from flower to flower some way off
you hear the contented buzz of a honeybee pleased with an afternoon of
pollen gathering the soil is soft under your bare feet warmed by the Sun above
your head fluffy white clouds Scud across a bright blue sky
your heart feels warm filled with gratitude and love for this place even
though you have just arrived you are safe here and you are happy take it all
in
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the air is warm and the Sun is gentle on your cheeks you feel loose relaxed let
yourself sink down into a reclining position your back cushioned by the lush
green grass underneath you a butterfly
floats overhead moving on to a nearby flower feel the soil underneath your
back smell the flowers the grass the
dirt all around you
see yourself looking upwards watching the clouds move across the sky they to
calm you loving your body into an even deeper tranquility
if you can imagine your body falling asleep in this mirror growing heavier
more relaxed your spirit may not want to
sleep yet and that is okay perhaps you want to envision your spirits standing
back up even as your imaginary body falls into a deep and restful stillness
[Music]
and now let your body slumber for a little while as your spirit continues
its journey into relaxation your body
will rest right here entirely safe entirely secure until you are ready to
return to it no harm will come to you during this meditation with this in mind
turn your eyes to the horizon at the
edge of the meadow you can see a leafy green band of trees standing Sentinel
the majestic guardians of this sacred space in your heart you know that there
is a tree there's that is taller and larger than the others far more ancient
than those that grow around it you feel inexplicably drawn toward it connected
at a deep and spiritually significant level you begin to walk towards the edge
of this meadow allow yourself to move towards the
forest following the path that appears at your feet and leads into the trees as you approach
they grow taller and taller in your vision beginning as the size of your
smallest finger in the distance but soon towering over your head
with a calm wisdom that permeates your entire being as you step under the
canopy you feel any stress or strain you're carrying begin to loosen falling
away in the same way dried leaves fall from the boughs of the maple in autumn
everything you let go of drifts away disappearing already decomposing into
the soil that will nurture the trees here for years to come
[Music] the sunshine here is less bright dappled
and soft instead of its usual brash gold
the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to
and yet it is a soothing coolness filled
with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss all around you stand
the trunks of trees and saplings some tall and smooth others old and knild
there are younger trees too skinny and gangly as they grow towards sunlight let
yourself sense the slow determination of these trees anchored by roots as long as
the tree is tall the trees are content
to simply be here calm and strong against the weather they welcome you
into their presence greet you as one just as ancient and wise as they are
[Music]
[Music] as you breathe deeply watching the
sunlight meander back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze bring your
attention back to your spiritual self the tree sense that there is something
you still carry with you a mental or emotional weight that troubles you even
in this place it is safe to understand it here perhaps you are mourning the end
of a relationship or struggling with a relationship that exists now maybe you
are tired after a long journey toward a still unreached goal
perhaps you worry about money or health either for yourself or for someone else
you might carry guilt or regret bitterness or perhaps even hatred
[Music] whatever appears does not make you evil
but is a sign of yourself outgrowing something that once used to fit there's
no need to judge yourself here but instead calmly regard whatever appears
in your mind and spirit [Music]
let whatever this may be surface within you and when you have looked at it from
every angle imagine as a handful of mud
materializing in your hands as you look
at it a breeze appears drying it out
turning it to dust blowing it away from you into the trees your palms are clean
and no trace remains of this worry or concern in your heart [Music]
feel the way the sunlight darts about moving with the fluttering leaves but
also heeling wherever your soul may be hurting first the wind cleansed you of
any emotional pain and now allow the Sun to heal you whatever may be aching
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you continue your walk down the path hearing the distant chatter of squirrels
and the occasional chirp of birds the
path leads you onwards as you take in the sounds sights and smells of the
forest drawing you onward until you reach the oldest tree in the forest
this particular tree has a trunk so large that a cave has been carved out
within the middle of it a perfect place for quiet reflection and contemplation
its bark is smooth with a goldish sheen and far far overhead the leaves dance in
the breeze with an almost silvery tint this tree is tall taller than any of the
others taller than the tallest building you have ever seen you sense its
benevolence the warmth with which it welcomes you invite you into its
magnificent cave deep within the girth of its trunk except its invitation you
begin to enter the cave knowing you are completely safe
although it's somewhat dark there are lit candles within already illuminating
the inside of this ancient tree your
soul grows light or with each step as the cool darkness of the woods gives way
again to the healing candle light within the cave helping you to relax deeper
almost instantly you feel calm wiser and
safe you feel an old familiar feeling a
serenity that you have not had for such a long while from the cave you can see
out to the entire forest witnessing the bobbing leaves of the other trees nearby
and a squirrel scampering about far off
in the distance a brightly colored swath of grass and flowers catches your eye it
is the meadow and you can see your physical body resting totally and
completely on this blissful summer's day
allow yourself to enjoy the tranquility of the cave and the view of the forest
feel a breeze into the cave and ruffle your hair and watch the Magnificent
scenery around you from this position
you can understand and see anything you like stay here
peaceful tranquil for as long as you like and if you would like allow your
spirit journey back through the forest and back to the meadow where you sink
down beside your physical body a washing piece and restful contentment
