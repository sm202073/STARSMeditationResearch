hello and welcome to this powerful guided meditation my name is Jason
Stephenson thank you for joining me this mindfulness meditation and visualization
will lead you with compassion and curiosity deeper and deeper into a state
of relaxation and then into the past before eventually carrying you into a
deep and peaceful sleep I invite you to open your heart to this journey to
whatever reveals itself knowing that you are unconditionally supported in each
and every moment that passes
allow the mind to rest aside as we move backwards through time there is nothing
you will need to actively search for and nothing you'll need to find images and
inner sensations may come for you but you will not need to control them
manipulate them or force them in any way
simply allow yourself to open up entirely to whatever moves through you
as we take this journey allow this
meditation in each moment to naturally reveal itself as you move deeper and
deeper into the past so before we begin
take a moment or two to come into a comfortable lying down position ensure
that you feel safe and secure wherever you are
ensure that your neck is aligned with the spine and your shoulders are relaxed
[Music] take a moment to consciously release all
muscles as you sink further into this supportive surface beneath you take a
few deep breaths here grounding yourself in this present moment use your breath
to guide you towards a place of complete stillness [Music]
although we will be moving through the expansive field of time you can always
ground yourself back into the present moment if you feel uncomfortable at any
point you are in complete control of this journey so if any images or
sensations arise that are too challenging for you to present Lee look
at simply use your breath to anchor yourself back into the present moment
you are always always in control of your
journey with that said if any challenging images
arise or if the experience becomes heavy you are also in an entirely safe domain
to explore them images that arise in our consciousness can never hurt us they are
solely tools or teachers that hold the potential to guide us forward in
powerful and positive ways know that you
are universally supported in each and every moment
now take a moment to come back to your body
notice your sense of touch through the way the surfaces around you make contact
with your physical body feel into the textures that are present
without moving noting how they feel as
they rest against your skin [Music]
consider the deeper levels of the physical body is it possible to become
mindful of the cellular world [Music]
notice your muscles and then invite them to relax
encouraging them to sink further into the surface beneath you
now consider the presence of air around your body and then gently follow it as
it moves within filling your lungs fully
as you take a breath in and returning to
the world around you on your exhale
allow the breath to become slow and steady just like the subtle lapping of
waves against the shoreline
take a few breaths on your own here following the innate rhythm of this life
force that supports you [Music]
[Music]
allow yourself to come into a state of relaxation by drawing your breath to the
heart space as you inhale allow your
heart to expand filling itself to the outer edges with peace joy and clarity
and as you exhale allow the walls of the heart to soften releasing any tension
that may be stored there [Music]
continue to breathe this way for a few more rounds effortlessly quietening the
mind as you move closer and closer towards the true state of your heart
[Music]
begin to notice a growing sense of peace and tranquility as you become more
attuned with the ever unfolding present moment in just a few moments we will
begin our regression into the past allow your imagination to enrich your visions
as you move further and further into the mystical landscape we are about to enter
[Music] for just a few moments allow the space
before your third eye to empty completely you may still see various
colors and swirls of energy passing before you there's no need to change or
attempt to control this instead see if
you can simply observe whatever is present there just in front of your
closed eyes [Music]
you don't have to judge it or attempt to change it in any way simply notice the
space that quietly and safely hold you in complete stillness
[Music] in just a moment your sink as far into
relaxation as is required for your personal present moment and needs simply
follow my voice as I count down guiding you deeper and deeper into a state of
all-encompassing peace and tranquility
10 you are feeling safe and secure
embraced by this open space 9 all stress
and tension is being released with every breath you take [Music]
eight you were feeling heavy nourished
by the energy around you [Music]
seven you are releasing even further six
every muscle is relaxed five you are completely comfortable to
let go for sinking further and further
three the mind is quiet and as you have come
to relax completely to
you breathe slowly deeply and effortlessly
and one you have arrived completely at peace completely relaxed
[Music]
all is quiet all is at peace
now something starts to appear before your eyes out of the vast empty space
before you you notice a mist developing
it is airy and enchanted somehow
beckoning you closer
you take a few steps towards this mist very slowly and mindfully and as you
approach it begins to dissipate as it
slowly clears you begin to see there is a bridge ahead of you covered in moss
and vines you make your way towards it
mindfully treading on the pressed earth beneath your feet and as you cross over
everything you ever knew begins to disappear all thought all attachments
all fears and all worries
you are entering into a new world into a different time
[Music] with every step you take you inch closer
towards the space and time just on the other side of the bridge it is a place
that feels familiar somehow but one that your conscious mind cannot put any
memory to the mist continues to clear
and you realize you are within a dense majestic forest you feel at home you
feel at peace here
[Music] he reached the other side of the bridge
and with the mist having vanished completely now you take a closer look at
the scenery around you notice the colors and textures of this vibrant forest
consider the way the earth feels beneath your feet [Music]
you heighten your awareness of the aroma that awakens as you inhale deeply
[Music]
allow this place to nurture the deep sense of peace that is within you
he walk forward ever so slightly as you noticed something peeking through from
within the trees and as you approach you
realize there is a cabin hidden within these woods and somehow you sense that
it is or was your own you instantly
remember it perhaps becoming flooded with visions of what it was once like in
your own time you reach the front door and enter
[Music] take a few moments to witness the
visuals that are arising [Music]
what does the cabin look like what happened here once upon a time
[Music] who is with you
imagery may come slowly and subtly
simply allow them to arise in their own time allow your imagination and
intuition to expand quite effortlessly
mindfully consider what was once here that no longer remains
[Music]
remain open to whatever arises there is no need to fear the past it no longer
has any control over you simply allow yourself to become the outside observer
of whatever you feel has happened here
watch this film play out as if you are a viewer rather than the character at
center stage [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
continue to breathe deeply as you simply observe whatever is present without
judgment or condemnation
[Music]
[Music] as we move through this time we shed old
ways of being in order to make room for more expansive ones mindfully begin to
consider what messages or lessons are being shared through these images that are arising what is there to be learned
what is there to shed
allow the mind to remain quiet as your
intuition arises tune in with your heart
opening yourself to the possibility of transformation
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] return to your breath
and to the aroma of the woods
take a few more moments to witness whatever once happened at this beautiful
cabin in the forest
[Music]
and slowly in your own time
returned to the bridge slowly crossing back over as you return
to the present physical reality you
passed through the mist once more making your way to the other side 10 you are
breathing deeply 9 you feel inspired and uplifted by what
you have learned 8 you are calm and
relaxed seven your breath flows as steady as
gentle waves caressing the shore [Music]
six the past fading now
five you feel deeply connected to the physical world for you exhale deeply
letting everything melt away
three you feel gratitude for the present reality you are in two you know that you
are whole and complete in this very moment
one you have arrived you are home once again you are at peace
[Music]
with the past now behind you you feel deeply settled within this present
moment you know that the past cannot be changed but that it provides opportunity
for growth and expansion everything you
witnessed now dissipates just as the mist did as you crossed over and into
the past you are still and silent and
for the moment nothing remains to be seen
you continue to allow positive and empowering lessons to reach you as you
transition into a sleeping state but you are not in search of anything you are
ready to rest easy for the entire night ahead dozing off swiftly and soundly
take a few more breaths mindfully inhaling peace contentment and freedom
[Music] and exhaling everything whatever once
was [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the only place that truly exists is this very moment everything that once was can
be used as a tool for self-realization at some future moment but for now allow
your breath to gently rock you to sleep
allow yourself to be nourished throughout the night ahead repeat the
following words to yourself in silence as you gently fall into a deep slumber I
am at home I am supported
I am at peace I am home
I am supported I am at peace
I am home I am supported
I am NOT peace
