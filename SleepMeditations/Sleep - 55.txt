hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this deep relaxation sleep
meditation the following meditation is designed to help you relax deeply and
sleep well it's called the 61 points of yoga nidra Yoga Nidra means yoga sleep
and is an effective way of helping even the most die-hard insomniac get their 40
winks for the night Yoga Nidra will take you into that intermediate state between
waking and sleep so you could also perform it while sitting upright on your
meditation mat or chair today's meditation however is designed for those
of you who want to nod off so it's best done lying on your back not your side or
on your stomach as doing so can affect your breathing so keep your spine
straight and make sure that your head faces straight up not turn to one side
lay your arms at a comfortable distance away from your body with your palms facing up and just spread your legs
enough apart so they don't touch each other both your arms and legs should be
kept straight not bent or elevated now
closing your lips and relax your jaw so there's a gap between your teeth and
gently rest the tip of your tongue against the back of your upper teeth and you can close your eyes go ahead and
figured as much as you need in order to get comfortable so in a few more moments
I'm going to ask you to synchronize your breathing to what I say
the idea of this is to begin to slow down your breathing so inhale for two
seconds exhale inhale again exhale and
inhale again exile
and now just extending that breath a little bit more now inhale for three seconds exhale
[Music] inhale
exhale so for this meditation or say a number
followed by a body part for instance it'll be one right index
finger now when you hear that number I want you to inhale and when you hear the
body part I want you to focus on that body part
and as you exhale I want you to pin your focus on that body part by thinking only
of that body part and no other and when you hear the next number followed by the
next body part inhale shift your focus to that new area then exhale as you pin
your focus to that new spot
