[Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and
welcome to this guided sleep meditation this is a meditation that is not only
good to help you sleep you may also find it a tool to help with lucid dreaming as
this is another way of entering that incredible state between wakefulness and
sleep our minds and bodies are like
children and the more we ignore their demands the more they demand our
attention so if sleep eludes you then you could be possibly ignoring some
demand from your body and your mind the solution there for us to pay attention
to them but on your own terms not theirs and that can start with this sleep
meditation it's based upon yoga nidra which literally means yogic sleep so
let's begin and please lie on your back and keep your arms away from your body with your palms facing up allow your
legs to naturally fall apart so that they're not touching each other if
you're using a pillow make sure it doesn't elevate your head too much so that it restricts your breathing just a
nice comfortable place so your back is as straight as possible but not held
rigid now I'd like you to close your eyes and pay attention to your breathing
inhale exhale inhale exhale your
breathing should be as relaxed and as natural as possible with no significant
pauses between each inhalation and exhalation now you don't have to make
any attempts to keep your breath even your job is to simply breathe as
naturally and comfortably as you can and pay attention to each in-breath and each
out breath during this meditation you
may find your mind wandering and that is normal our minds do wander your job is
just to simply gently bring your focus back to your breathing or to my voice
let's begin this beautiful process of a an internal mental massage if you like
and to bring you into that deep state of yoga nidra so please take a few more
breaths and let's begin relax the top of
your head now letting go of any tensions you might be feeling there
relax your face and all your facial muscles and just bring your mind to your
forward and let it smooth itself out
relax your eyelids your eyes and the fleshy part around your eye sockets
let go and relax now your upper and lower lips but keep them together
relax your cheeks from the top of your cheekbone all the way down to your jaw
line
allow your jaw to sag and let there be a slight gap between your teeth relax the
fleshy part beneath your jaw from your chin all the way down to your neck
release any tension at the top of your neck and let that feeling spread down to
the base of your throat and bring your
attention to the back of your neck let it go relax its entire length from the
top where it meets your skull all the way down to where your shoulders begin
relax your shoulders and let that feeling spread outwards to your shoulder
joints the armpits and the space between
your shoulder blades let them all sink deeper into your bed
relax your upper arms let them become heavier and feel that heaviness seep
down to your elbows and into the soft inner flesh opposite your elbows
relax your lower arms feel that heaviness seep into your wrists into the
back bony part of your hands and into your soft palms just allow that
heaviness to fill your knuckles pushing out any tightness discomfort or pain
that you might be feeling in them relax
your fingers and all the joints of your fingers let your fingers curl or fall
wherever they will just allow them to be
relax the sides of your chest and let that feeling spread toward the center
and relax your solar plexus and let that feeling spread down to your stomach the
sides of your stomach and around to your lower back
relax and release your hips your thighs your groin and your buttocks
now relax and let go your upper legs and feel that heaviness use down your knees
and to the back of your knees
relax your shins and the fleshy strip that lies beside them let that heaviness
now use all the way down to your ankles
relax your heel your instep and the top bony part of your feet relax the
knuckles of your feet your toes and every joint of your toes paying
attention to the fleshy pads at the tip of your toes and even feel them relaxed
as well feel the heaviness within your
toes within your toe joints and within the knuckles of your feet
feel the heaviness within the top bony part of your feet the heaviness within
your instep and your heel and feel that
heaviness in your carves your shins and your knees that heaviness pulls your
upper legs deeper into your sheets your
buttocks your hips and your lower back sink deeper and deeper into your bed
with a relaxing soothing heaviness
your stomach is heavy your chest is heavy your solar plexus is heavy and
your breathing becomes deeper slower
your shoulders are heavy your shoulder blades are heavy as is the space between
your shoulder blades your neck and
throat are heavy as is the back of your head
your chin your jaws your tongue and your
cheeks are heavy
your lips are heavy your eyelids are
heavy and your eyes within them sink deeper into the back of your head

slower and deeper still

so welcome this is yoga nidra the state between waking and sleep here you have
two choices you can allow yourself to let go and sink deeper into that heavier
darkness of sleep and dreams if so then good night and may your
dreams be joyful and pleasant or you can choose to remain here in this in-between
state here there is only your breath and
your mind here there is only the
heaviness of total surrender and complete relaxation your body is already
asleep but still receptive to any command you may wish to give it notice
your breath and your body's response to it
as you breathe in feel your body expand and rise with it as you breathe out feel
your body contract and sink with it inhale your body expands and rises
though the heaviness remains and exhale your body contracts and sinks deeper
into heaviness inhale you expand and
rise exhale you contract and for yoga
nidra is a warm peaceful and comforting ocean in its waters your body finds the
rest it needs to begin its healing process all of the day's worries
stresses and pains are washed away in its deepness so here there is only
restfulness peace and regeneration in
this sanctuary there is only the wind of your breath and your breath is the tide
of your life inhale and life fills you exhale and all
your stresses worries and pains are blown away let the tide of your breath
work with you and for you for you are your breath and your breath is your life
you are not your body relaxed heavy and still in the state of sleep your body is
only the vessel by which you anchor yourself to this world the puppet by
which you create the drama you call life
just as you fill this vessel with your in-breath only to empty it out again
with your out-breath so you can choose what you bring into your experience into
the drama of your life what you create you can uncreate and what you begin you
can end in this state between waking and
sleep all resistance ends there are no obstacles here no barriers no
constraints and no impossibilities except what you deliberately choose in
this state there are only infinite possibilities infinite choices and
infinite power so choose wisely in this
state your life begins anew so stay with
this meditation now for as long as you choose
