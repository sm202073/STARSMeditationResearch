all emotional and physical healing is supported by love acceptance and
forgiveness of yourself you are energy your thoughts are energy and your
self-talk is energy to give yourself the opportunity to use your energy for
healing it is important to release the negative energy of shame guilt and anger
towards yourself the last thoughts before you drift off
to sleep stay with your subconscious and can create a profound alteration in your
beliefs tonight and in the future love accept and forgive yourself to free

positive thoughts of kindness and compassion for yourself you may find
that the more you listen to this recording the more truly you begin to
build love for yourself welcome to the mindful movement I'm Sara
Raymond and I am grateful you have joined me to cultivate a sense of
unconditional love for yourself and to heal while you sleep
now I invite you to relax make yourself comfortable and prepare your environment
to safely drift off to sleep lay down in
your bed if you like and close your eyes
allow my voice to be your guide into relaxation you can let my voice drift
off into the background and allow sleep to come to you when your body is ready
[Music] your subconscious mind will continue listening and forming new positive
pathways inviting healing to occur
if it feels right to you for the beginning of this meditation place your
right hand on your belly and your left hand on your heart as you rest let these
gentle points of contact signal a connection to yourself as you feel your
hand on your heart and on your belly offer love and kindness to these parts
of you let this quality of love sink in
to your being
as you continue to settle into comfort bring your attention to your breath in
just a moment I will guide you through a three-dimensional or a complete breath
practice [Music]
begin to bring a little more intention to your breath now on your next inhale
move your breath into the front of your body fill up the entire front of your
abdomen from the bottom of your pelvis into your belly up to your ribs chest
collarbones and throat [Music]
and exhale fully emptying the front of your body
continue using this intentional breath to create space and open up the front of
your body allow each full exhale to be
slow letting go in to relaxation you may
feel the rise of your belly and chest subtly moving your hands resting there
filling and releasing fully with each breath cycle
each breath in fills you up with a building positive energy each breath out
is cleansing releasing any negativity or
any energy that you want to let go of
take one more breath like this filling up the front of your body and releasing
completely and now move the intention of
your breath to the sides of your body [Music]
imagine you could breathe in directly to your sides
[Music] moving the air from the sides of your
waist up to the sides of your ribs and even up
to your underarms and letting go
releasing your breath from this area [Music]
continue breathing in and expanding side to side filling laterally with positive
energy and emptying completely each
breath in is Earth's energy it is the
energy of love this energy is limitless
and healing as it fills up the sides of
your body continue in this way breathing into the
sides of your body you may notice that
your body is beginning to calm down and relax perhaps you feel a stretching and
a lengthening sensation with each deep breath into the sides of your body
take one more breath in to the size of your body
and let it go and now move the intention
of your breath to the back of your body as you breathe in deeply feel the
expansion of your back from the base of your spine up through your lower back
your back ribs shoulders and even into
the back of your head and breathe out completely
breathe in positive energy breathe out
anything you would like to let go of
each breath in and out is full and deep
take one more full breath now expanding the back of your body and releasing any
remaining tension
and finally take your most complete
breath yet take a full breath a three-dimensional breath fill the front
the sides and the back of your body all together each breath starts from the
base of your spine fills up three-dimensionally into your waist and
your ribcage as you breathe in expand
your chest your throat and all the way up to the crown of your head

positive energy from within

energy of love breathe in this way for
two more full breath cycles taking your time
[Music]
[Music]
allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and depth
notice how this intentional deep breath practice has altered your mood and your
level of relaxation
take the next few moments to simply be aware of the state of your body as it is
without changing or judging this present
moment
as you continue to settle in notice how
you are feeling right now what would it
be like to relax your posture to find
more ease
what would it feel like to let go in anyway that brings you deeper into
comfort are there any areas that you can
relax further
maybe you sense a shift as you allow your body to sink down into the surface
below you let gravity settle over you
there is no need to hold against it anymore there is no need to carry the
weight of the world on your shoulders any longer [Music]
notice any areas in your body where you may be holding on to tension or
tightness and invite a sense of ease to
wash over you give yourself permission

go and relax anywhere you can

heart visualize a warm healing light
