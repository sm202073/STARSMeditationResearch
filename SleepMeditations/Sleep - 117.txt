let go of limiting beliefs and replace them with positive beliefs as you sleep
drift off to sleep in a peaceful state to enjoy the immense benefits of a night
of deep nourishing sleep welcome to the mindful movement i'm
sarah raymond and tonight it's time to relax
as i guide you on a journey for complete body and mind relaxation
and now i invite you to make yourself comfortable
make sure you're ready to drift to sleep
adjust your environment and posture so you can have the feeling
of complete safety and support [Music]
as we begin allow your eyes to close gently
and begin to relax
notice your breath now without making any changes to your
breath recognize how it flows in through your nose
and fills up your body with life
[Music] follow the flow
of the air as it comes into your body through your nostrils
and notice how your chest and abdomen rise and fall
naturally as the breath comes in
and goes out
the breath can be your anchor or your reminder
to remain present with your experience
when you focus on your breath you are always focused in the present
you cannot get back a past breath and you cannot breathe in a future
breath before the present moment
as you continue to stay with your breath allow it to flow naturally
release any physical and emotional tension with each exhale
[Music] let any tightness
drift away from your experience
and now begin to deepen each breath in and out
as your breath fills you up more fully focus your attention
on the space that comes between the inhale
and the exhale
allow this stillness to last a little longer
pausing momentarily between each inhale
and exhale
and as you breathe in this way for a few more cycles
feel the tension easily release
from your body
give yourself permission to be fully supported
safe and embraced by the nourishing energy
around you
you can be open to the possibilities of what comes with this state
of comfort
allow the sounds and the responsibilities of the world around you
to turn off or be tuned out
as you continue to relax you may still have thoughts going
through your mind and that's okay notice them
from afar as if you are an
observer and invite the space between your thoughts to extend
just as you did with the space between your breaths
in just a moment i will guide you to continue this practice
of awareness as you bring your attention to your
physical body to deepen your relaxation
and your connection with yourself
as you hear each part of your body being named
you will first bring your awareness to that part noticing how it feels
without judgment
and then by simply paying attention you will relax that part fully
now turn your attention to the top of your head
visualize and feel your scalp and head
and then relax notice how powerful your awareness is
and how just a thought in your mind can have the ability to relax you so
deeply
continue this scan of your body as you feel your forehead
soften and smooth
next invite ease into your eyes
allowing the tiny muscles in and around your eyes
to release [Music]
feel your cheeks soften
allow your teeth to part as you unclench your jaw
and relax your tongue
sense your throat softening and your neck
letting go of any held tension
invite your shoulders to relax completely
as you let go of the heavy weight of responsibilities
you have been carrying
allow this wave of ease and comfort to move down
as the tension flows out of your shoulders
down your arms and releases out of your body through
your fingertips
with each breath notice the contraction
and expansion of your abdomen and chest
as the sensation of heaviness washes over you
allow your chest to relax completely
this comfort begins to move down your body now
releasing any tightness from your lower back and hips
your thighs feel heavy and sink into the surface below you
allow your knees to soften and your calves to relax
as your body continues to rest your ankles and feet
let go of any remaining tension
and now your body can be completely relaxed
safe and supported [Music]
you can allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation
letting go as you drift deeper
and sink deeper into tranquility
now as you continue to rest
follow the sound of my voice on this journey of relaxation
take notice of any thoughts or distractions that come into your mind
simply acknowledge the thought and allow your breath
to carry it away like a cloud drifting by in the sky
[Music] now begin to use your imagination
and see yourself on a soft fluffy white cloud
this cloud is special it is just for you
and it exists only in your mind
when you lay down on this cloud it fits you perfectly
it supports you entirely so you can let go of any need for
holding on
this is the most perfect and comfortable cloud made just for you
and as you rest on this cloud you will safely take a journey
as it drifts you off to a special
safe sanctuary a peaceful place
[Music] call to mind a beautiful place where
your cloud will be taking you
this place may be one you have been to before
or one that exists only in your imagination
any place where you're happy and that peace
is perfect see yourself in this peaceful place
here you are happy calm safe
and at peace
take in all your surroundings use all of your senses
and know that when you are in this perfect place
nothing bad can happen you are completely safe
and supported you are in control
and i am simply your guide [Music]
here in this deeply tranquil state incredible changes can be made with your
subconscious mind in this place
you are more in touch with yourself than you have ever been before
you are relaxed and happy here
in just a moment i am going to count down from ten to one
and as i do you can allow yourself to relax completely
on this soft cloud feel comfortable
in this special place allowing yourself to go deeper
drift deeper and sink deeper into relaxation
and each number you hear will bring you closer to sleep
and as i begin to count you continue
to relax deeper ten
letting go completely nine
you are deeply relaxed
eight feel yourself release any stress or tension
seven your entire body softens
six give yourself permission to fully let go
5. drifting down deeper and deeper
four your relaxation continues to double with each number
three feel a sense of ease envelop your entire body and mind
two you are going deeper into comfort
and one all the way down into a deep relaxation
now as you continue to relax and enjoy your peaceful place
you can follow my voice as a guide or let me fade into the background
[Music]
in order to make room for new and positive beliefs in your mind
you must first let go of old outdated beliefs
that have been holding you back
and now just like the trees let go of their leaves in autumn
let go of any negative thoughts or beliefs
that do not serve you
let go of any past negativities so that you can replace them
with positive thoughts and gratitude
see those leaves falling from the tree branches representing any limiting beliefs
they easily fall to the ground to make room for new
healthy leaves to grow in their place when spring comes
believe that you are strong and confident in your life
and you can see your limiting behaviors and beliefs disappear
feel that self-doubt and fear are things of the past
you no longer need to have the beliefs that have been getting in your way
and once you see all of these leaves falling to the ground
imagine a strong wind blowing those leaves
out of your sight never to affect you negatively again
and now that you have let go of past beliefs you have made room
for new ones to be adopted
you will hear me speak statements or ideas to contemplate
that will support you with these positive statements
settling into the deepest part of your subconscious
you will be wonderfully surprised at you're increasing self-confidence
self-love and self-worth
this increase is because you are connected to yourself
and you are confidently true to who you are
consider the possibility of a life lived confidently
authentically and with the deep belief
that you are enough as you are [Music]
imagine what this life will look like
in this wonderful life you take time each day to slow down
to listen to your own needs and your own desires
you can confidently handle any challenging or stressful times
because you are emotionally resilient
you choose to connect with what is true for you
to connect with the emotions that arise with acceptance
and compassion
you focus on the positive and it gives you the confidence
to grow and be a better version of yourself each day
more and more with each day that passes
you experience an increase in your self-confidence
and your connection and clarity to what is true in your heart
each day you become more and more convinced of your own ability
to live in alignment with your personal truth and values
in this ideal life every day you are improved
every day you are getting better and stronger
every day your connection to yourself to your spirit
to your personal truth is getting stronger
you find that you are now easily making choices that support your personal development
you find that you are okay with making mistakes
because you know that they are an opportunity to learn and grow
and you appreciate those times
the more you listen to this recording the more you believe in yourself
you take time to be mindful and aware of your feelings
your emotions and your true self
you know to be happy and fulfilled you must connect with what is true for
you
you are able to find happiness in the little things
and you take time every day to experience moments of gratitude
your thoughts are positive and give you the confidence
to live life to the fullest
you feel enthusiasm and confidence in all that you do
and you know that with this gratitude confidence and positive thinking
you can get through any potentially tough situation
all you need is to believe in yourself and to practice loving kindness
and compassion for yourself
you are willing to be present and mindful in your life
so that you can live it to the fullest
you are strong enough to face your emotions clear-headed and fully present
and you know you're safe to experience these emotions
as you are listening you are instructing and motivating your mind
to move you towards the life you desire
you choose to take even better care of yourself redefining yourself
as a new happy energetic and self-loving person
you allow new empowered thoughts and inspired feelings of success
health and wellness to break through each and every day
these thoughts are profoundly building within you
[Music] you find that you love and accept yourself
you choose to take time every day to recognize and strengthen
your own natural abilities and this helps to create the patterns
that work best in your life
you choose to be the person you want to be
[Music] and as these
changes take shape in your mind
repeat these statements and feel them as truth
i am enough
i take time to connect with what is true for me
i am strongly connected to my heart and my feelings
i am worthy of love health success
and all that i desire
i practice loving kindness and compassion for myself
i am open to the positive possibilities that may come my way
[Music]
i live in the present moment [Music]
and now you can trust your and your abilities
because you are connected to your true self
feel the building confidence and strength
and now that you are connected to your true self with love and acceptance
you are amazingly unstoppable [Music] feeling forever proud of yourself
everything that you have let go of makes room for the rejuvenation
of a deep night sleep [Music]
and this comes to you easily and effortlessly
because you have prepared your mind and body
sleep is inviting you to let go
allow this to happen if you wish knowing that you are safe
and supported and all the powerful beliefs
and qualities will continue to build
while you sleep soundly through the night
and when you wake many hours later
you will still feel confident and connected to yourself
you will love and accept yourself fully
so as you drift into serene peaceful rest
my voice will gradually disappear
and you will be deeply asleep
