my name is Jason Stephenson and welcomed
this guided morning meditation as you
slowly awaken this morning this
meditation will gently guide you into a
natural embrace of the day ahead before
we begin I invite you to come into a
comfortable position whether that
sitting or lying down ensure that the
spine is straight your shoulders are
relaxed and the neck should be aligned
with the spine
gently relaxed
so just take a moment to adjust yourself
in any way necessary just to ensure you
are comfortable and supported
when you were ready allowing your eyes
to gently close
to begin this meditation simply come to
notice your breath
you
without trying to change it without
judgment or assessment
notice the nature of it
witness the way it effortlessly moves
into the body and then back out
you
just become attuned to the natural flow
of the breath as though observing the
breath the full length of each breath in
and out
you
you
you
as you begin to settle take a moment to
witness the entirety of your body
End mind our thoughts
often when we wake
of our dreams
and we hold on the thoughts about the
days behind and the days ahead of us so
simply begin to observe from a place of
non-attachment whatever you may be
carrying in the physical body
just gently witnessing any areas of
tension or discomfort
and in
breath to nurture these areas
take a few deep breaths into each area
of the body calling for your attention
and then gently release them
allow your body to sink for a moment
into complete stillness
and silence
you
you
in the same way now draw your attention
to anything arising in the mind
now there is no need to search for
anything simply observe yourself
open up to the thoughts that may be
pre-existing
they make themselves known just witness
the nature of them
the same way release them
simply intangible ideas about what has
come or what may be to come
as you do this naturally notice yourself
sinking further into this present moment
sinking deeply into this waking day
you
whatever ideas you have about the day
ahead I invite you to set them aside a
short while
you explore the moment you are presently
in
just notice through the physical body
the surface that supports you
you are seated on or the mattress you
were lying on might be the floor
quietly observe any sounds or physical
sensations around you
strong or subtle
you
and through your closed eyes notice if
there's any sense of sunlight trickling
in
shadows dancing behind your closed eyes
you
as you come to mindfully explore the
world around you there is silence and
stillness begin to make note of the
presence of day
you
just continue to allow the breath to
guide you through this gentle awakening
of the senses
noticing how you are inextricably linked
through the breath to the world outside
of you
allow each in-breath to nourish you
and each breath out to free you of any
constriction fatigue or even thoughts
that may be lingering
allow yourself to be nourished through
the breath
as you open your heart to this new day
you
you
I invite you now to draw your awareness
to your belly and as you do watch the
way the breath flows in through your
chest
filling the entirety of your lungs
causes the stomach to expand to rise
and you might witness an expansion of
the chest area as well an opening up of
the heart space
you
if the mind wanders continue to simply
invited back down and into the physical
body
wait for now simply embrace and enjoy
these quiet moments of stillness
presence and awareness
allowing yourself to tune into the
energy of a gentle a natural expansion
that comes with sunrise
you
now from this place of complete
awareness and presence
tune into the heart space drawing your
awareness to the center of the chest
and allow your heart to expand
as it expands envision it touching all
possibilities for the day ahead
you might envision a white or a golden
light radiating out from the heart
making contact with the future that is
continually unfolding
you
if you find any anxious or fearful
thoughts arise just witness them without
becoming attached to them
and gently focus back into your heart
space or into the golden light radiating
from this space within you
you
focusing now on your highest potential
and visions for the day it might be
goals that you want to achieve
things that you want to set out to do or
you need to do and allow any cluttering
or limiting thoughts to naturally fall
away and there is no need to force
anything out of existence or to judge or
condemn anything that might be arising
less than your highest potential arises
simply notice it acknowledge it and
allow it to dissipate
you
whatever we envision on a regular
we start to manifest in the outer world
consciously reflect for a moment on
whatever it is your highest self wishes
to manifest in your life or more
specifically in the day ahead
what is the deepest yearning of your
heart
what is the energy you wish to carry
with you throughout your day
continuing to feel into the hearts glow
and compassionately allowing conflicting
mental chatter to subside as a higher
truth reveals itself
you
begin to narrow in on what is it you
wish to manifest considering for a
moment that you already hold whatever it
is you may take a few moments to breathe
into this feeling as if it is already
present within you
allow your thoughts to be clear and
conscious stemming from the core of who
you are
you might like to consider in the words
of Rumi what you seek is seeking you
just allow the openness of your heart to
hold the truth that whatever you hope to
embody is already here it is already
present within you
you
just coming back to the body now and
taking in a few more grounding breaths
before setting a powerful intention for
the day ahead
allow yourself to be completely here
truth
to go and nothing you need to achieve
as we increase our ability to be fully
present
and limiting thoughts begin to fall away
and you begin to embody more deeply the
truth of who you are
silent and steady breaths here rooting
yourself in the expanding energy of this
morning
you
so from this place of pure presence
but you now to set one more clear and
powerful intention for your day consider
whatever it is you wish to embody and
state it to yourself as if it were
already here
for instance if you are longing is for
self-confidence and esteem consider a
phrase such as I am confident and
complete
or if the stability and safety are of
your highest concern perhaps an
affirmation like all of my deepest needs
are being met
just allow yourself to become very clear
and focused on your intention as you
begin to repeat it to yourself with each
full breath
so take a few moments of silence here as
you align your intention with your
breath letting the words fill you up
entirely again and again but just a few
moments
you
so wherever you are now resting come to
notice once again with eyes closed
environment around you feel into the
physical support of the ground beneath
you
of the material world it has been
manifested around you
see if you can notice the air of the
room that you are currently in
sounds near far
you
take three more full breaths here
knowing that you are unconditionally
supported in this journey
gently begin to soften the area around
the eyes
and when you are ready slowly open them
up to the world around you noticing the
delicate transition from dark to light
as you move forward in outward action
continually come back to the intention
you are carrying within you knowing that
the universe is here to support guide
and nourish you with every step that you
take
