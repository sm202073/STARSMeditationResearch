[Music]
hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will focus on inner
clearing forgiveness and the Hawaiian prayer our pono pono my name is Jason
Stevenson and I invite you to gently open your heart as you move with me
through this deeply healing and restorative practice and closing your
eyes if you've not done so then explore what it feels like to fully arrive here
and to arrive in this sense means simply to let your mind join your body to set
aside for the time being any notions about the past or the future you can
help your mind to arrive here by tuning into the surface beneath your body or by
holding your entire being in open awareness
establishing this sense of presence will anchor you as you journey through this practice of clearing away any past
mistakes wrongdoings and resentments because as we surrender into this moment
it becomes more natural to surrender any inner workings that prevent us from
living in the name of love patience forgiveness and understanding now let
your attention land on the breaths flow if it's not already there and simply mind this natural movement of lifeforce
as you ground into this practice for a few more moments a few more breaths
[Music]
let each inhalation create an inner expansion and each exhalation and inner
softening
[Music]
the Hawaiian prayer our pono pono is a practice of healing and clearing through
forgiveness translated this term can be understood to mean to make right or to
correct some definitions even refer to it as a mental and emotional cleansing
during this practice we will explore the power of forgiveness by first easing the
physical body and then moving into a guided visualization for a deeper level
of mental and emotional clearing we will
finish this practice with a repeated ho'oponopono mantra as you gently
surrender into a good night's sleep
so I invite you now to take a moment to come back to the physical body simply
noting what it is like to be in the present space that you occupy and as you
are guided through the physical body I invite you to bring your loving awareness to each area that we pass as
you inhale into each corner of the body bring a healing white light or a sense
of love to that area and as you exhale
let it soften into the present moment
so beginning now at your toes holding them in your full awareness breathe
loving energy into these parts of you sending the breath all the way down and
then exhale to let any tension here dissipate
and moving up now to your ankles breathing in deeply down into your
ankles and releasing
your calves and shins sending the breath down and releasing softening
moving up to your knees breathing in
breathing out your thighs and your
hamstrings [Music]
and shifting the focus to your pelvis and your hips breathing in and on the
breath out softening your belly and your
lower back
[Music] and then moving up to your spy into your
chest and your upper back [Music]
now draw your attention to your fingertips breathing light or love into
your entire hands and releasing on the
out-breath
continuing with your wrists
your lower arms
your elbows
[Music] moving up to your upper arms breathing
in breathing out and release and your
shoulders
breathing in loving energy into your throat area and soften as you exhale
continue with your jaw and your mouth
[Music]
your cheeks ears and nose
you your third eye area between your two
eyebrows [Music]
and then finish by breathing this way into the crown of your head
hold your entire body in your awareness now for a few more grounding breaths
before we move deeper into this process of clearing you might imagine that your
entire body is being bathed in a white light one that frees you of any
inhibiting physical tension
and then gently let that white light dissipate in your own time
now this will be a journey of clearing and forgiveness and while on the other
side of these processes is deep peace and love the journey itself may be
challenging for some depending upon how you find yourself in this moment
offering yourself or others forgiveness may cause difficult emotions to arise if
this turns out to be the case for you tonight remember that you can always come back to your breath or your body to
ground yourself let your heart journey as deep as it is
meant to be in this moment knowing that you are universally supported
so take a moment to find yourself standing outside of a home or cabin that
feels safe comfortable and welcoming to you
it might be a home that you know or one that the mind creates in either case
observe what its exterior looks like what is it made of
what is the surrounding environment like
what about this abode that warms the heart and soul
take a few moments to cultivate an image of this home in your mind letting it
bring you a sense of safety and peace
[Music] this home has shown up view today to
serve as a symbol for coming home to yourself it represents a return to the
love support and care that is within you and so before you make your way inside
take a moment to set an intention to love care for and support yourself
unconditionally
and now as you reach your hand for the door handle you slowly turn pull and
make your way inside standing in the
front hallway you feel an immense sense of relief and gratitude wash over you
the home is exactly what you imagined it would be when you stood outside of it
a sanctuary full of love light and beauty that also lives at the very core
of your being
take a moment to imagine what this hallway looks like what colors are its
walls what details and accents does it
boast what artwork adorns it
now you slowly walk down the drifting main hallway soon arriving in a living
space that is warm at ease and full of soul and charm it contains details both
large and small that bring you a sense of coming home to yourself this room is
a perfect reflection of who you are at your loving core take a few moments now
to paint in your mind's eye [Music]
notice the windows the light and the
energy that this room holds
imagine now that alongside one wall of this room is a mirror tall and wide it
reflects back the entire room into the onlookers eyes depending upon what angle
it is approached at something about this mirror is mesmerizing and then you
notice that just in front of it cushions and blankets rest as if it's been
waiting for you slowly and mindfully you
make your way over to this little oasis within the soulful room you've designed
taking a seat upon the blankets and cushions presented here you settle in
straightening the spine as much as comfortable and letting the shoulders
relaxed
your jaw softens as does your forehead and belly and then you meet your own
eyes in the shimmering mirror as you
stare into your own reflection take a moment to simulate a knee ously hold
your heart in your awareness let the
loving compassionate energy of your heart be the source of the healing or
clearing that is possible here
and as you hold your own gaze in this mirror you sense that you are returning
to yourself how long you wonder has it
been since you've been this lovingly attuned to your own inner reflection and
yet while love is indeed present here you might find that limiting judgements
about who you are or where you've been come up to the surface because sometimes
when we attempt to love cherish or accept ourselves the mind rises with its
whispers of resistance often these inner
judgmental whispers are subtle and yet they can have such a strong effect on
how much love forgiveness and kindness we are able to grant ourselves
[Music] so in order to clear whatever stories
thoughts or beliefs that may be holding you back from unconditional
self-acceptance and reconciliation with your true self you look at yourself in
the mirror as you slowly repeat these words I love you I'm sorry please
forgive me thank you
[Music] I love you I'm sorry
please forgive me thank you
I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you
spend some time now on your own in silence cultivating these words and an
energy of deep care and consideration for yourself
as you whisper these words I love you I'm sorry please forgive me and thank
you invisible knots of resentment judgment
and wrongdoing begin to untangle themselves from your body your body
becomes lighter your mind becomes freer and your heart becomes more loving
[Music]
whatever you may hold against yourself and whatever you may have done in the
past does not define who you really are
beneath the wise and loving energy of forgiveness you are able to clear
yourself you repeat these affirmations
three more times now each I love you I'm
sorry please forgive me
thank you I love you [Music]
I'm sorry please forgive me
thank you I love you I'm sorry
please forgive me [Music] thank you
[Music] now the words dissipate into the
atmosphere around you as you come back to the quiet space with him you meet
your reflection in the mirror once again feeling a wave of gratitude washed
through you you are grateful for the energies of love kindness and
forgiveness is showing up today and you are grateful for this return to yourself
for this inner reconciliation
if you need some more time to connect with your loving center imagine yourself
resting a hand upon your heart and breathing into that space each
inhalation brings a wave of self-love and each exhalation frees you from the
entanglement of judgment resentment and the past
you take one last look in the mirror and then you turn away from it and back
towards the beautiful room that holds you and as you rest here grounded in
both the earth and in your heart take a moment to consider if there is anyone
you might like to offer this loving forgiving and clearing energy to
[Music]
when you feel ready to simply offer to any individuals or to the universe at
large the loving-kindness that has cleared you here tonight
and when you were ready come back to your breath and to the homey room that
supports you [Music]
take three full deep breaths in your own timing now surrendering any residual
tension with a sigh as needed [Music]
[Music]
let your breath resume its natural rhythm after that third deep breath
[Music]
and within the image of this inner sanctuary envision yourself coming to
curl up on the floor or a couch within this room envision yourself fully
supported by cushions and blankets and then gently close your eyes on even this
visualization
as you come back to your body and to the reality that holds you know that the
energies you cultivated in this sacred home are now embedded within you as you
drift into sleep they were strengthened their roots so that you will soon embody their wisdom
in each and every cell of your being
allow your body to melt taking a brief moment to notice if there is any tension
that might like to be released or any adjustments that need to be made and as
you surrender into this space that hold you allow this Hawaiian prayer to
continue clearing your inner world of that which no longer serves you
I love you I'm sorry
please forgive me thank you
I love you I'm sorry please forgive me
[Music] thank you I love you
I'm sorry please forgive me
