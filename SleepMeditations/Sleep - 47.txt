breathing deeply again and fully exhale
and repeat inhale slowly and fully exhale on the breath out let any tension
dissipate just let it all go [Music]
now it's easy for your mind to wander during a meditation session but don't
let that worry you this is natural this is a part of the meditation process and
you will soon gain control over your mind just gently and firmly bring it
back if your thoughts start to race acknowledge the thought and then bring
it back again to your breathing it's all
a part of the learning process and you will still gain all the benefits of this meditation session so if you're ready
let's begin
visualize yourself now transported to the steps leading up to an old bridge
made from stone weathered from time and from an assault by the elements there
are steps curving upwards with cast iron railings swirling alongside affording
magnificent views across the deep tranquil waters surrounded by a mass of
greenery the breeze is soft against your
skin warm but soothing visualize
yourself moving up the steps each step is worn and uneven but they
are shallow you find them easy to climb
trail your fingers across the top of the railings and feel the iron warm beneath
your fingertips
at the final step turn and look across the expanse of water it is afternoon and
the Sun has started its gradual descent across the sky and as the light changes
the trees surrounding the water glow and the colors change
for perhaps the first time you become in tune with nature you become aware of the
depth of color that exists as clouds
scurry across the blue expanse of sky notice how the light shifts and the
sun's rays muted send rays of gold across the tranquil waters flecks of
light dance on the tips of slow-moving water cresting in places this place
exudes serenity you feel calm
you feel relaxed you feel peaceful
inhale deeply drawing fresh pure oxygen
deeply into your lungs exhale fully
feeling your lungs deflate as you do so
and repeat this intake of breath feeling air inflating your lungs once more and
as you breathe out let go of any negative feelings or tension that you
may be harboring in your body just let it all go
turn your attention back to the scene in front of you and notice the power of
blue sky as if dabbed on creatively and mixed with cotton wool white to form the
clouds a screen of green adorns the
edges of blue the breeze sends leaves whirling up into the air along with the
blossom you watch it as it cascades even
higher at the mercy of the air current and gradually released dropping towards
the surface of the water where once lazy fish rise to the surface to investigate
as you stand here and observe you realize that you are an integral part of
this scene there is a sense of oneness
yet you have not been here before it is
as if something has been missing in life previously and now there is a sense of
wonder as to what is to come ask yourself who are you deep within
what do you need what are you searching for
just allow these questions to resonate within you
you feel a deeply wonderful connection with nature more than you have thought
was possible you feel mesmerised by the
sun's rays as they penetrate the foliage casting an almost autumn glow as clouds
scurry past the Sun the light changes again and this time the leaves are
shimmering gold and yellow these trees
are different they Bend and sway teased by the breeze
it is as if you are standing on the threshold of two worlds it is as if
you're looking back over the past and all that could have been when you turn
and look in the other direction your perspective shifts and you are filled
with positive energy life is fleeting
every second merges with the next and clock hands continue to move never
pausing each passing moment striding fords to greet the next and such is life
with each season that blends effortlessly the world continues to turn
this place feels almost spiritual and it feels as if the missing piece of the
puzzle revealing the secrets of the universe as clicked into place this is a
place where the past the present and the future merge here life is almost
timeless you have time to think to feel and to
embrace the positive energy that is here you can contemplate and carve out a
route towards happiness in life there
are many lessons to be learned as we can learn much through letting go of tension
and of deeply relaxing calming the mind
only then in your mind perceive all that is possible so relax breathing in and
breathing out
be at peace with yourself find
contentment in this moment as the birds
above perform well choreographed flight across the sky effectively using the air
currents to lift and twist and turn and
butterflies flutter delicately their reflections mirrored in the water below
you know that you have never been so at peace with nature you yearn for the
freedom to fly and understand that to be free we sometimes have to make changes
in life
fragrance fills the air as plants lift their faces up to the Sun as you breathe
in this delicate fragrance clears any muddled thoughts away and soothes your
soul
turning now you see a narrow trail leading off into the woodland space and
tempted begin to move towards it feeling
each step down as you leave the bridge
this trail undulates throughout fresh young saplings and shrubs all the eyeing
for their place in the sunlight you
follow a small Inlet of water that meanders across the narrow trail
alongside your chosen pathway it is
cooler here with some of the taller trees blocking sunlight with only
glimpses of gold penetrating those taller trees and the Rays and you bathe
in natural light replenishing your aura
you watch as the leaves fall you see
each one with a shimmering energy as the leaf spirals around and dances on the
breeze this brings an instant sense of
reflection into your mind what do you need to let go of in life what changes
are necessary to help you grow and develop as a person and to reach your
full potential
which part of your life needs more focus
do you long for love perhaps you need a career satisfaction each one of us needs
to find our own pathway through life so that we can reach our true potential and
feel great happiness all around you is
the purest energy of life which can be utilized at any time you need life love
and happiness is here in abundance reach
out and draw it to you
you are empowered you are in control of
your life [Music]
insects dart and hover seemingly oblivious to your presence or simply
accepting you are a part of this natural scene you feel so peaceful and so
relaxed as the bird saw even higher consider the
heights at which that inner you can soar to if you let go of the stresses and
strains of life do you feel shackled to
the past isn't it time to break free and to
explore all there is to offer visualize now the chains of life breaking free and
breathe in deeply inhaling the purest joy that freedom offers and exhale
slowly casting all doubts to one side
mentally repeat these words to yourself I allow instinct to guide me
I embrace freedom of choice I welcome
the opportunity to make life changes
I fully embrace my abundant life
the sound of water nearby is soothing
your eyes feel heavy asleep gently nudges you follow a new pathway taking
you to the water's edge where dark and light depths greet you this pathway
resonates with you it shows you that life is a series of choices walk the
road less traveled and you may be rewarded with experiences and successes
you have not thought possible
there is an abundance of natural energy light shade love and contentment you
only have to let it into your life
the Sun shimmers and teases the shallow depth sprinkling light on the surface
the contrast is spectacular all around
you is nature at its best the energy of
the place reverberates deep within you
it is a perfect place for relaxation it is as if nature has sculpted a
semicircle of trees plants and flowers and there is an abundance of vibrant
color and fragrances
the tree nearest to the water's edge branches out over the water and one
large gnarled old branch reaches inland and across the grassy area beneath your
feet tied to the branch a perfect seat
for you to relax in so to forge a stronger connection with this tranquil
scene you clamber onto this world
crafted swing seat which is adorned with deep cushions for support it fits you
perfectly and feels so comfortable
you feel weightless and as the breeze increases the seat starts to swing
gently back and forth you hold on to the
strong chords holding the seat and cast your eyes across the river catching a
glimpse of the bridge mainly hidden from view by the trees growing alongside the
riverbank this is perfection
let sleep claim you your eyes are becoming heavier yet your body feels
weightless tension dissipates with every
intake of breath you feel peaceful you
are relaxed you are sleepy
[Music] feel the sensation of the supportive
cushions soft beneath you and let yourself drift away this is the perfect
place for sleep you are a part of nature
there is nothing to disturb you in this place you are safe you are peaceful you are an
integral part of the universe and as you breathe in and out you replenish your
mind body and soul with healing energy and life-giving oxygen
with each breath out relax even further
releasing any negative thoughts or feelings let them go breathing in
positive energy and on your exhale release old worn out negative patterns
blow them away allow the light of
potential for your future to shine brightly think of it as a star that
leads the way towards successes and whatever your heart desires
as you feel yourself slowly falling asleep know that your subconscious mind
will work on solving any of life's questions or problems while you sleep
deeply it's time to let go of anxiety of
unresolved traumas or outstanding issues
nothing matters at this moment but to simply be
this is your place you can return here at any time you need
all you need to do is close your eyes focus on your breathing and transport
yourself back to the bridge as if the entry point to this tranquil setting
here there is only positive energy visit
at night or during the day visit whenever you need to each time you come
here your senses will be awash with the wonders of positive energy and
well-being each time you'll be greeted
with new science and new sensations every experience every sensation
promotes your personal positive energy
within this place you open your perception the gentle swaying of the
trees highlights your need to be flexible in life the falling of leaves
highlights you'll need to let go of some elements that hold you back in your own
life the bird soaring overhead
I like your need to be free and to reach your full potential the gentle sound of
water as it passes on reminds you of your need to be flexible in life and to
go with the flow
now it's time to let go of muddled thoughts and self doubts you see life
clearly the universe and the natural wonders of the world provides you with
energy to inspire to encourage and to
see the best route through life for you
here there is an abundance of positivity you have it all everything you need to
carve out the life you have always wanted let's leap claim you now
your eyes are getting heavier [Music]
that all thoughts dissipate
yeah there are no thoughts or feelings beyond the sensation of peace let
yourself drift away sleep deeply you
will wake up when your mind and body is fully replenished but until then allow the tranquil
setting the gentle movement of your comfortable swing seat and the sounds of
nature to lull you into a contented and peaceful state
inhale deeply and exhale fully
drift away if you want to end this meditation now
simply stretch out and open your eyes
however if you want to continue just allow the sounds of nature to take you
away
