good evening and welcome to this practice to close your day with clarity
and to set your intentions for tomorrow I'm Sarah Raymond with the mindful
movement and I'm honored to be your guide for this powerful practice to set the
tone for a peaceful night's sleep this meditation is a ritual to be practiced
daily as the final step you take before going to sleep you can
use me as your guide or choose to practice on your own after you are
comfortable with the ritual it is okay if you fall asleep during this
meditation as your subconscious mind is still listening this can also be paired
with the morning meditation to start your day with clarity for an even more powerful experience
the last moments before sleep are so important to us
because we take these moments to sleep with us
they have a tremendous impact on how we recover while we sleep as well as how we
are refreshed to start our next day when
we wake up our thoughts pick up where they left off tomorrow is a new day
we can use this as an opportunity to give us the best chance to begin our day
with a positive attitude and in alignment with our values and intentions
now I invite you to make yourself comfortable take a moment and make sure
you are in a safe place to drift off into sleep if that is your intention
make sure the room is dark all screens
and electronics are off and that you are
comfortable and safe [Music]
it is time to let today go it is time to
be in this present moment time for
relaxing and time for preparing for the
night's sleep ahead
[Music] once you are ready to begin the journey
to a more peaceful mind and body to bring closure to your day to let go of
the busyness of the mind bring your
attention to your breath [Music]

breaths signal the start of this practice
