who are you when you set aside all limiting ideas about who you are
and what you're capable of who are you when you open up to the
infinite possibilities of who you might become
when we remove any limiting self-definitions we are left solely with a sense of i
am and with limitless potential for becoming
in the bible god said i am that i am which we might understand to mean
i am what i name myself to be
my name is jason stevenson and in this i am practice you will start to become
more of what you name yourself to be through the absorption of positive empowering
affirmations as each affirmation moves through you i invite you to simply remain
open to it feel its energy move through you as it positively transforms any negative
or limiting subconscious beliefs these affirmations work best when the
conscious mind is relaxed so allow yourself to drift gently
off to sleep as they work their magic on your softening mind
begin by taking a moment to settle in ensuring that your body is as
comfortable and supported as possible
close your eyes take a long cleansing breath
[Music] and then allow yourself to relax as you absorb these affirmations
