Allu my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation
designed to help you ease into a peaceful night's sleep
in this meditation you will be guided to gently release any held stress and
anxiety allowing the body and mind to rest with ease throughout the night this
visualization will take you on a magical inner forest journey where you will encounter various creatures along the
way that will guide you further along the path towards release peace and
tranquillity all that is required of you is your innate capacity for openness so
gently allow the body and mind to soften as we begin this journey before you
release yourself from what's being carried on throughout today just take a moment now to get comfortable adjust
yourself as necessary you might want to use further cushions or blankets or get
your pillow exactly as you would like [Music]
and just allow the body to softly relax taking a moment to feel into the
physical environment you find yourself in keeping your eyes closed allow your
body to revel in the physical world around you taking pause here to give
gratitude to this very moment where you find yourself currently in so I invite
you now to bring your awareness to your breath
simply by observing it the breath draws our attention to the present moment and
is within this present moment that everything else naturally falls away
allow your breath to be your anchor guiding you through the silent gaps
between the visualizations of this meditation
[Music]
follow your breath sound natural rhythm watching it naturally deepen as you draw
your attention to it there is no breathing technique required
here only an honest and open witnessing
as you watch the breath allow any thoughts or judgments to fall away it is
not necessary for anything within your experience to look or feel a certain way
simply begin to open your heart to the simplicity and perfection of this very
moment allowing yourself to be exactly as you are right now also keep in mind
that with the all meditations you are always in control the power to visualize
to manifest and to embody is yours and yours alone so allow now the energy of
the forest to simply guide you into deeper knowings that already exists within you know that
whatever sensations feelings or thoughts that may arise are entirely natural
you simply witness them before allowing them to pass drawing yourself further
into the enchanted forest you are about to discover
so just take a few more fully aware breaths preparing the body for deep rest
and relief of all stress tension and anxiety
as the mind and body softens further into a state of tranquility slowly allow
visions of a dense forest to grow within your mind's eye at the foot of this
dream the richness of complex soil systems form the ground beneath you and
out of this magical earth sprouts elaborate greenery trees shrubs flowers
and vines allow the wildness of this
forest to grow and then eventually steady out drawing you into the lush
beauty and complete stillness of the forest
take a few deep breaths here allowing the forest air to fill the entirety of
your lungs [Music]
with each inhalation notice yourself becoming infused with nature's healing
powers and with each breath out witness
yourself releasing some sensations of stress or tension into the healing air
around you binding yourself now standing
or sitting within an opening in these woods continue to take slow and deep
breaths here allowing yourself to be in the majesty of the forest
you are entirely safe and supported within these woods knowing that nothing
here can harm you you open yourself up quite naturally to the messages that
come your way
in the stillness of this moment this deep forest within you hear a gentle
stirring in the dense woods before you slowly and with grace a deer emerges
into the opening you resting she is gentle and soft footed presenting no
threat to your well-being the two of you
watch one another with an incredible openness that permeates the core your
being rehearsed soft movements you begin
to see that she is here to bestow her wisdom upon you the gift of softness
kindness and grace
[Music] this deer grants you the ability to
harness your intuitive capabilities
within this reawakening of intuition you
know it is a safe place to gently release the entanglements of the mind that may be fogging over your clearest
visions you might like to take a few
deep breaths here allowing the mind to be released on each exhalation
the deer departs lowly and you were left with her softness and the trace of her
silent footing you begin to breathe more deeply and the mind begins to loosen its
grasp all of the breath here for a few moments allowing it to carry you deep
into the richness of this present moment
with each inhalation you are nourished and with each exhalation you are freed
from the confines of the mind
you rest once more in the peaceful opening of the woods this time an animal
makes itself seen not from its footing on the earth floor but rather as it
soars above the dense canopy the eagle flies overhead with strength courage and
clear-sightedness you watch in awe as it
flies between earth and the cosmos as if it were the king of this forest or the
king of the open air the Eagle comes as
a messenger to reveal a human connection to the divine by way of its appearance
here it bestows upon you the gift of power of healing and of wisdom
you begin to feel divinely connected to the forest to these animals and to the
energy that swirls around you to spirit or to the universe
knowing that you are supported by something higher than yourself you begin
to release further into this present moment stress or anxiety carried in the
body or mind continue to melt away you
come the sense that within the grand scheme of the universe the tension that
you carry no longer serves you you release it gently into the air with each
out breath
as the eagle slowly disappears from sight you are left with an awareness of
this magical connection between body mind and spirit
so in this moment continue to breathe mindfully you draw yourself again and
again breath by breath into this present
moment within the space of this forest you
continue to breathe in the healing air releasing that which no longer serves
you to the woods to be transformed you find yourself resting more comfortably
and with greater ease in this present moment
[Music]
your connection to the forest is deepening as you become more settled within its environment you feel inspired
by the animals and greenery that nourishes you here and you are fully
open to whatever may come knowing that nothing can harm you in any way
just before you an agile Lynx emerges from the woods she's quiet and
contemplative and she watches you with knowing eyes
the Lynx has incredible insights and strong intuition his highly instinctive
encourages you to trust your own instincts in the same way she bears the
gift of solitude of patience and of caution the Lynx remind you that there
is nothing to be done in this instant all that she asks is for you to pay
attention with discernment slowly your
path unfolds itself with her grace you'll gently be guided along the way or
that you are required to do now in this moment is to relax and listen
as she disappears into the density of the forest the Lynx leaves you in
solitude the air is quiet now and you
are beginning to revel in the stillness and silence that is within you as you
tune in now gently following your breath you come into contact with the joy and
freedom within this very moment
as you gently follow your breath you come into contact with this very moment
what emotions do you feel here you might
feel joy you might feel sadness you might not
feel anything and this is all perfectly okay at this moment just allow the
outside world to melt away as you
experience a deeper sense of peace within sink into this moment a little
bit further using your breath to
continually ground you in this present moment remind yourself that with each
inhalation you are deeply nourished and with each exhalation you softly
unnaturally release any stress or tension
[Music]
as the light begins to fall away behind the trees a calming energy comes over
the forest within the center of it you
feel yourself to be quiet at home connected deeply with everything that it
holds
before the light fades away you catch sight of something moving delicately and
gently through the air above the most vibrant butterfly you of ever witnessed
litters there is dancing peacefully and radiantly through the air around her a
complete embodiment of her own radiance she carries the message of joy lightness
and transformation
the butterfly is not always been this way before opening her wings she spent a
period of time within a hardened shell during this period of non movement she
transformed bringing her to a place where she is now littering through the
lush forest very much alive
as the night falls the butterfly leaves you with the feeling of inspiration and
a growing faith in the unfolding journey held within the innate wisdom of this
ever-changing journey you soften ever more deeply into the unknown see if you
can allow all stress and tension to melt away just trusting in this moment a
natural flow of the universe
light turns to darkness and still you stay there within this forest you are at
peace here Elden nourished by the free air around you as you breathe you begin to release
any tension that might be still tucked away within this body now lying
comfortably on the forest floor you scan the body gently allowing any sensation
of discomfort to naturally dissipate
see if you can witness all of your stress and anxiety melting away into the
ground beneath you
you are at one at peace in this moment with the natural
flow of the world around you
Eldar nourished within the opening of the forest you are gently rocked to
sleep the wind caresses your skin and
continues to breathe itself through you the air is warm on this summer night and
your body is completely at ease you
notice the faintest sounds of the forest as they lull you to sleep
[Music]
before fading into a peaceful slumber you hear a wolf howling in the distance
there is no fear within you at hearing this sound rather you feel a divine
connection to this Wolf's voice you know deep down that this wolf will not harm
you and that it is here to guide you
his sound calls to you to remind you that you were divinely connected and
supported he is a symbol of guardianship
loyalty and courage highly instinctive
creatures woofs rely on their own inner knowing and this too is the gift they provide
you the wolf's voice appears now to
remind you to trust your own inner workings to follow your heart and trust
your gut is how radiates through your being as
you begin to embody greater courage trust and strength unfolding subtly
moment to moment breath by breath
embodying this wisdom you allow yourself to sink all the way into this present
moment you release every ounce of stress
and tension allowing the wisdom of your body to carry you into a deeply healing
and restorative sleep you know
intuitively that there is nothing to be done in this moment and nothing to be
achieved continue to follow the breath you sink deeper and deeper into this
body nothing else matters nothing else
pulls you in any direction the breath gently carries you into sleep as your
mind drifts away you are at peace
beginning to take comfort in your sleep
letting go letting go
