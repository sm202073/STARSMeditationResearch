allow the room you are in and the surface that supports you to facilitate
sleep whenever you feel yourself
drifting off and sleep begins to happen
you are free to drift off into comfort
and safety allow your awareness to move
to your heart space [Music]
here create a sense of opening a sense
of space for love and kindness for yourself and as your heart opens invite
an energy of light into this space [Music]
whatever color comes to mind to represent this space with a soft glow
welcomed it let this light present
itself in the shape of a sphere since it
floating just above your heart space
as you begin to relax and slow your breath down allow this light to dissolve
over your entire body imagine in your
mind this light turning to liquid
smoothing over your body and blanketing your immediate surroundings spreading a
sense of love and kindness within you and all around you
let this feeling of love and kindness for yourself set the tone for your
practice and notice how this feels in
your body
know that you have a say in the space that you create
you can let your practice deepen by building your breath slowly begin to
strengthen your inhale allow more time
with each inhale drawing air in through
your nose be patient as you fill up
breathing out slowly when you are ready
direct each inhale to be deep in both location and in volume and breathe out
slowly
on your next inhale fill up your belly first and then let the fresh air fill
the space around your ribs imagine the
inhale continuing into your neck and head and then breathing out completely
allowing yourself to relax deeper
continue building and focusing on your inhale for a moment longer
[Music]
[Music] now change your focus and build a strong
connection with your exhale with each
breath out let go further into the
restful support of the surface below you
allow the awareness of your exhale to entirely encompass your breath like a
small child in all of a captivating ly beautiful flower
let the full span of your attention zero in on this one breath notice your strong
loving inhale and this long forgiving
exhale
and now this breath
and this one
keep your attention on your breath and begin to soften your body in order to
allow each breath to smooth over a
little more
let each exhale drag on a bit longer
create a sense of patience at the end of your exhale allow a little more time and
space after you exhale
notice how you do not need to begin the next inhale it will happen automatically
[Music] give yourself some space for drifting
[Music]
your inhale will begin as it is needed
notice your comfort building at the end of your exhale
perhaps this comfort can move throughout your body and spread out a little
further
your body is listening to the message you're slowing breath is sending to it
your body is receiving this signal to relax a little deeper now
since the surface below you notice that
it is very supportive and it is inviting
you to sink a little deeper now accept
this invitation and feel your body letting go letting go letting go
[Music]
now enjoy the easy flow of your natural breath feel the cool air as it passes
into your nostrils and fills you up [Music]
encourage each natural out-breath to release any remaining tension that you
might be feeling to continue to go
deeper allow each breath to naturally slow down
now allow your awareness to easily flow
and meander through your physical experience remain relaxed including your
eyes so you can visualize your body with your mind's eye

become aware of your own physical presence allow the weight of your body
and your bones to become heavy feel
