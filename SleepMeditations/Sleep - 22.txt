hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this soothing nighttime
meditation designed to help you to fully relax and to let go this will include a
body scan meditation as we move through this meditation allow
my voice and the sound of rainfall to guide you through this process of deep
release and restoration know that you are safe and supported
throughout this meditation in each and every moment that unfolds
you to come into a comfortable lying down position any resting position will do but try to
ensure that your chest is open and your neck is in line with your spine
just sink a little bit further into the surface that supports you
the physical world will nurture you throughout the journey so feel free to invite the intention to surrender to
your body and mind at this present moment letting yourself sink deeply into the
physical space beneath you
to help affirm moment to repeat the following words
after me I am free to let go
I am free to let go I am free to let go
now gently release any and all words that are circulating within the mind as
you open your heart and body allowing them to guide the way
this meditation is aimed to help you release tension in the body and to let
go of all stress and unease that is present in the mind
as we move through life it is not uncommon to become weighed down by
things that have happened in the past by things we think we are
by things we think that other people are by fears about the future
and while there are doubtedly many challenges that exist in this human experience
we can help to reset both body and mind by consciously inviting ourselves to
surrender or resistance to this present moment
because the truth is that cannot harm you
cannot harm you is here to nourish and support you
so take a few deep breaths now as you remind yourself that you are entirely
safe right here right now
you
now draw your awareness to the natural rhythm of your breath
without trying to change it in any way simply observe its flow and depth in
this moment
you
notice any sensations that are present as you inhale deeply through the nose
and as you exhale completely allowing your lungs and belly to soften entirely
you notice the sound of the breath makes
notice the way the breath interacts with the physical body putting any visceral sensations as it
moves through you a few moments of silence he
simply observing your direct experience of the breath right at this moment
you
draw your attention now to the belly and observe the way the breath follows you there
allow each inhalation to expand the stomach completely
exhalation to soften the belly letting all tension and contraction of muscles
melt away the depths of the belly as you breathe
allowing your breath to move freely to the furthest corners of the body
you
as we mindfully allow the breath to touch deeper reaches of the respiratory system we unconsciously activate the
body's relaxation response this response helps to slow a racing
heart sue the worried mind and release tense muscles
take a few moments of silence now to consciously observe the belly and the breath flowing in harmony
you
I invite you now to tune into your sense of sound
labeling or judging anything that filters through your ears simply become
aware of the vibrations that enter your awareness
sounds maybe near
subtle hole loud
just note them without hanging on to them allowing them to come and go the
way waves and flow
you
now as you tune into the sound of the rain
beginning to fill your eardrums begin to
observe the way it cleanses your body of everything it has been holding on to for
some time rain is a beautiful and
powerful tool of transformation that will help to nourish and cleanse your entire being through your journey so
surrender gently now to the healing rain that falls through your awareness
carry your attention away from your sense of sound now as you move more deeply into your sense of touch take a
moment to observe each area of your physical body that is in contact with
the surface beneath you see if you can notice the temperature and texture of
each surface that is nestled against your skin
see if you can release a little bit further still into the bed or any other
surface that support you
now to prepare the soil for the mind to feel free and safe to let go of all
worried and repetitive thoughts let us move more deeply into the body I invite
you now to follow my voice as I guide you through a complete body scan to help
you release all tight muscles both conscious and unconscious as you listen
simply allow your attention to move to the area's you hear mentioned
consciously inviting release and relaxation to each of these parts so
let's begin by taking three full breaths while holding awareness of your body as
a whole there is no need to actively change anything right now just simply
observe
now draw your attention to your left toes feeling into them with just your
awareness as we move through this
exercise try to refrain from moving sing
if you can witness each area while maintaining complete stillness so
breathing into your left toes noticing their presence and then on your next
exhalation release any and all tension that resides there completely allowing
them to be entirely free within this moment of stillness
witness and release all tension in your left foot now inhaling and exhaling as
you observe this area of the body
move up to the ankle breathing into this space and then exhaling softening
completely
witness and release the lower left leg
breathing in and out of the left knee area
and the upper left leg
so hold the entire left leg in your awareness now inhaling nourishment into
this area of the body and exhaling or stress tension and unease
now draw your awareness to the right toes inhaling deeply and then releasing
them on the next exhale
and continue in the same way as you observe the right foot
the right ankle
the lower right leg
the knee
and the upper right leg
and take a moment now to hold your entire right leg in your awareness
welcoming deep release on the inhalation and inviting it to let go completely
on your next exhalation
bring your awareness now to your pelvis breathing down to your pelvis and
release and your hips
and to the buttocks
allowing each of these areas to sink deeply into the surface beneath you as
you come to fully relax each part
witness and release your belly
the lower back
and then gently draw your awareness up to the spine consciously relaxing the
muscles all around your vertebrae as you draw your awareness upwards
inhale deeply into the full capacity of the lungs and then exhale slowly
allowing your chest to completely relax
continue to observe the sounds around you allowing the distant rain to wash
your physical body clean of all stressors and thoughts that may have
been unconsciously lodged away
witness and relax your left fingers now
into your left hand
your left wrist
and lower left arm
observe and then release a tightness or contraction in the elbow
and the upper left arm and moving slowly
until finally reaching the left shoulder
just hold your entire left arm in your awareness as you let go of all
discomfort and tension stored in this area of the body
draw your awareness now to the right fingertips
and to the right hand
release or discomfort in the right wrist
and breathing into the lower right arm
the elbow
and the upper right arm
breathing deeply and then exhale allowing the shoulders to soften as well
just witness and release the entire right arm now
now observe the neck area letting go of anything stored in the throat region so
to fully relax this area take a deep inhalation and as you exhale release a
deep sigh through your escaping breath and notice the way the rest of the body
is reminded to soften as you do this
relax your jaw
the cheeks
and the nose
draw your attention now to all the small muscles around your eyes and forward
consciously inviting them to let go of all stress they may be carrying
observe and relax the top of your head inviting all thoughts to dissolve as you
become more and more tuned into the simplicity of the present moment
and finally hold your entire body in your awareness catch the mind when it
attempts to search for something prove something or chase something just accept
this present moment experience - the way it is reminding yourself that there is
nothing to do nothing to prove and nothing you need to be you are already
enough right here right now
take a few more minutes to breathe into the fullness of your body imagine your breath reaching all the way
down to the tips of each limb follow
your breath all the way there watching and nourishing the entire body as it
moves through every inch of your being so take a moment now to let everything
melt away as you tune into the sound of the rain falling all around you open
your ears fully as the rain cleanses your body mind and heart
if you notice your thoughts wandering at any point simply observe this wandering
as a tendency of the mind without attaching yourself to the ideas or
stories it is drifting too it is easy to
become swept away by the current of the mind but as we practice gently releasing
these thoughts streams we find that we become more like the rock bed beneath
the stream still solid and deeply rooted
to the present moment
now open your awareness more intently to the sounds around you once again rain
continues to fall washing away or thoughts and stories that no longer
serve you
take a moment now to imagine yourself lying in a safe space that is open to
the elements witness yourself resting
peacefully here perhaps directly on the earth or perhaps supported by blankets
or cushions observe the area around you
someplace with lush greenery bright blossoms that have been nourished by the
falling rains
witness the way the rain falls upon your body nurturing you much the same way
that it supports and nourishes the plant life around you as the rain falls down
you begin to grow out of an older version of you out of older stories out
of old attachments and out of any confinements imposed on you by the mind
you begin to blossom
the rain is warm against your skin comforting you as it gently Falls take a
moment to simply observe yourself here in this moment witnessing your entire
being resting completely at peace beneath the softness of rain that trickles down
as thoughts arise within the mind observe them as the energy bodies that
do not belong to you and then practice raising them ever so slightly so that
they come to rest on the surface of your skin somewhere along your forehead and
as the rain trickles down what should carry these thoughts away with it
gliding effortlessly away from your body and down down down into the earth
the earth and rain paired together are a powerful tool of transformation the
earth helps to ground to hold energies freeing up space for new life to be born
while the rain helps to improve flow in the physical world
water continues to trickle down from the expansive sky taking in and releasing
all old thoughts stories and beliefs that might continue to arise breathe
through an open heart as you allow whatever arises to be cleansed
if fearful worried or judgmental thoughts arise about this process of
release or about your intent to let go simply observe these thoughts as their
own life forms too and remind yourself
that they are separate from who you really are
they do not belong to you and they no
longer serve you just open your heart to
freedom to release and personal growth
compassionately inviting the old to be returned to the earth for processing and
renewal
if physical tension or discomfort arises within the body observe that too and
then gently guide the tense energy towards the surface of the body as the
rain trickles down witness it carrying away any and/or discomfort that may have
been lodged away in the muscles and cells there is no need to carry this
tension any longer
continue to ground yourself through the sound of the falling rain allowing it to
be your anchor into the present moment
while keeping the breath deep draw your awareness to the heart space filling it
with love and ease on each inhalation and freeing it of all tension stress and
concern on each exhalation
through your exhalations offer up all remaining tension to be cleansed by the
rain perhaps sighing deeply as you feel into this process of letting go
your entire being may now be much lighter and at once was your heart rate
has slowed and your breathing has taken on a deep and steady rhythm just allow
the breath to rock you gently as the rain continues to trickle down
though the rain continues it finds less and less stress and discomfort needing
to be cleansed away you are now moving towards a state of deep peace and
relaxation completely free of everything
that once weighed you down
now gently let go of any remaining visuals in your mind's eye allowing the
image of you being bathed by the rain to slowly melt away in its place with eyes
remaining closed tuned into the space around you once again
observe the feel of the surfaces beneath you and around you
and then connect to the air as it brushes against your skin
and as it fills your lungs
continue to breathe slowly and deeply as you continue to hold your awareness on
this state of complete ease and relaxation
there is nothing left for you to do to open your heart
and surrender your mind to a deep and restorative sleep
very soon your mindful awareness will melt away
into a deep and peaceful slumber till then
continue to witness the breath coming and going like waves
ABing and flowing Oh being and flowing
you
