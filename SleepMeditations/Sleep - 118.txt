we all have an inner companion you might think of this companion as a
best friend that is always within us every time you
come to your meditation practice this inner companion is with you
this inner companion is your breath and it has an immense wisdom about you
and your needs if you choose to connect and listen it connects your body
and mind for nourishment and healing [Music]
tonight as you drift easily to sleep and while you sleep soundly throughout
the night build a sense of safety connect with your inner companion
and experience happiness and contentment
welcome to tonight's deep sleep meditative practice from the mindful movement i'm sarah
raymond now as we begin i invite you to make
yourself comfortable
take a moment to look around the room you are in to recognize that you are safe
and that you can feel comfortable drifting to sleep for the night
when you are ready close your eyes and settle as you connect
with your own inner wisdom and true self
the day is complete and you can now give yourself permission to let go
and relax into comfort
let your body sink into the surface below you
make any adjustments you need in your body to let yourself settle deeper into
the support
and recognize that you are supported so you can let go
as you gradually settle connect with your inner companion your breath
it is always there for you ready to connect you to a calm
and peaceful state at any moment
it's a reminder as you settle in that you have given
yourself this gift of meditation
bring your awareness to the natural rhythm of your breath
at first simply notice the sensations that accompany your breath
maybe you feel a slightly cool sensation as the air passes through your nostrils
perhaps you feel a floating sensation as your abdomen and chest
rise and fill with breath
or a heaviness as the air moves out of your body
taking with it any tension or tightness
whatever you are feeling is just right simply observe the experience
as you inhale sense an opening or a creation of spaciousness
at the area of your heart
and when you exhale feel a gentle compression in this area as
your lungs are giving your heart a hug
this internal support from your inner companion
is available to you with each and every breath you take
so knowing this you can be comforted that you
are always supported from within
allow this support welcome the breath
invite the inner hug
shortly i will guide you to take several deep breaths sensing
first your inhale and then inviting your exhale to be
slightly longer than your inhale
you can always welcome a short pause after you exhale
trusting that your body will know when to breathe in again
begin to intentionally inhale deeply
and extend your exhale slightly longer than your inhale
after you exhale welcome a brief pause for the length of time that feels
comfortable for you today
and breathe in again trusting you know the timing that is right for
you
continue this way and trust the wisdom of your body
in connection with your inner
companion
allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical or emotional stress
and tension [Music]
by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow
[Music] your body and mind will calm down
in response
trust and allow
i'll remain quiet as you enjoy this practice for the next few moments
when your mind wanders simply begin again
and guide your focus back to your breath
[Music]
so
release this breath pattern now [Music]
and as your breath returns to its natural rhythm
notice the change in how you feel
let gravity settle over you there is no need to hold against it
anymore there is no need to carry the weight of
the world on your shoulders any longer
notice any areas in your body where you may be holding on to tension
or tightness
and invite a sense of ease to wash over you
give yourself permission to enjoy letting go
into relaxation
now is your time to be fully supported
to let go and relax anywhere you can
as you observe your body soften and release
any areas you are able
invite the feeling of peace as you begin to tune out
the whole world around you [Music]
and go within with my voice as a soothing guide
to help you sleep
now follow the sound of my voice as i guide your attention
on a relaxed journey moving your attention through various
parts of your body without effort
let go of stories or expectations of these parts of your body
and notice them as if meeting them for the first time
[Music] as your focus flows your energy will follow
and this will invite ease into your body [Music]
as your physical body continues to relax
become aware of the sensations at your forehead
notice your right eye and your left eye
relax the tiny muscles and nerves in and around both of your eyes
and feel as your eyelids become heavy [Music]
sense your right cheek from the outside
as well as from inside your mouth [Music]
now your left cheek outside and
inside your mouth
allow both of your cheeks to soften inside
and out
become aware of the right side of your jaw
and the left side of your jaw
unclench both sides of your jaw and allow your teeth to part gently
move your attention to the inside of your mouth now
notice your gums and your tongue soften
now that your face eyes and mouth are completely relaxed
consider the idea of a smile
the part of a smile we can see and that we associate with the word
smile is on the face
we recognize a smile in the eyes the turning up of the corners of the
mouth a glow over the entire face
there is so much this simple gesture can convey to another person
as well as make us feel from within
this is only part of how a smile can be experienced throughout the entire
body [Music] this is only a fraction of how
a smile can be expressed
sense a relaxed smile on your face now [Music]
perhaps it feels artificial at first
allow the smile to move over your entire face
[Music]
a smile can change your mood change how you feel about yourself
and others
it can alter your perspective and bring joy to your state of being
as you explore and connect with your physical experience
look inward and consider what it would feel like
to draw a connection between a smile on your face
with a smiling at your heart
how would it feel to be smiling from your heart
perhaps you might experience a smile of the heart with each inhale
as your chest rises [Music] and your collarbones widen
then each exhale your lungs continue to give your heart another hug
as you inhale in your mind think i am smiling
as you exhale in your mind think i am supporting myself
with a hug
invite the sensations of the smile from your face to move down to the space around your
heart
allow these smiling qualities to surround you like a warm
embrace of a loved one
connect with your smile with every breath you take
as a reminder to come back to yourself
if you find your mind wandering lovingly bring your attention back
to your smile and to each breath
inhale i am
smiling exhale i am supporting myself
with a hug
[Music]
a smile tells your body that you are
okay a smile tells you that you can accept joy and happiness
keep your attention on your smile on the sensations of your smile
on your face and on your heart
and on the joyful emotions your smile can evoke
a smile can unravel the tension and help you let go of negativity
continue to stay with the sensations of your smile
allow it to relax you even more deeply
allow your smile to bring joy contentment and peace
a smile is the language of the soul the language of the body
let your smile be an expression of your inner companion
that you are your own best friend
this smile from within lets you know you have what you need inside yourself
now let your smile fade as you remain connected to the
joy and love within you
as your physical body continues to relax
and your thinking mind can rest
in a moment i will guide your subconscious with some positive affirmative
statements of joy love
and compassion to develop your own inner wisdom
my voice becomes your voice as you hear these positive affirmations
as your own beliefs
there is nothing for you to do and it is normal for your listening
to fade as you allow sleep to come easily to you
your subconscious will listen as your body relaxes
i love and accept myself just as i am
i am my own best friend
i believe in myself
every day my confidence is building
i am beautiful inside and out
i respect who i am
i respect myself and my body
