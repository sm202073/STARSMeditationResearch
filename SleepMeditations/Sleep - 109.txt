hello and welcome i'm sarah raymond here at the mindful movement we are an
oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset
and the ability for self-healing tonight build your positive beliefs about
yourself improve your confidence and self-worth all while you sleep by using this deep
sleep hypnosis practice daily for at least 21 days you will
imprint these beliefs into your subconscious and experience the most powerful positive
transformation before we get started make sure you are prepared to drift off to sleep when this
recording is over if you like know that you are safe and supported and you can awake from
this state of relaxation anytime you choose to do so
and now i invite you to make yourself comfortable
for the start of this practice lay down on your back if you are able feel free to place a
pillow under your knees to help keep your back comfortable
interlace your hands and place them at the base of your head
here you will feel two bony points at about the hairline [Music]
very gently lengthen these points away from your shoulders
you might sense a subtle tilt downward of your chin
if you are unable to place your hands here you can still do this with one or both
hands by your sides allow your head to rest very heavy in
your hands now and begin to relax
now with your eyes open and without moving your head
look as far to your right as you are able
although it may be dark continue to keep your eyes to your right
as you breathe in and out deeply through your nose
take about three more breaths allowing yourself to let go
into relaxation
now with your eyes open and without moving your head look as far to your left as you are able
just like you did on the other side continue to keep your eyes to your left
as you breathe in and out deeply for a total of four
breaths allowing yourself to sink deeper and deeper
into a relaxed awareness of yourself
once more with your eyes open and without moving your head this time
look upwards roll your eyes up as if you are trying to look at your own
eyebrows breathe in breathe out
you may notice your eyes beginning to blink or flutter as you are looking up
keep breathing in and out
once more deep breath in and as you breathe out give in
to the heaviness of your eyelids and allow your eyes to close down
as your eyelids close sense the muscles in and around your
eyes becoming relaxed and heavy and this is a sign
to the rest of your body to let go deeper into hypnosis
now just forget all about your eyes and allow your arms to rest easy by your
sides as you continue to go deeper
deeper means developing a stronger connection with yourself
as you go deeper into the perfect relaxed state of hypnosis
you feel your confidence building growing back to the confidence you were
born with remember hypnosis is a completely
relaxed state of the nervous system where you listen with your subconscious
mind in this state you take new
positive suggestions and plant them into your mind to develop new
powerful beliefs about yourself
you have the profound ability to communicate directly with your mind and tell it
exactly what you want how you want to feel
and what you want to believe about yourself
here you can let go of old negative beliefs about yourself
that are keeping you stuck
in a moment allow my soothing voice to lull you towards sleep
as i guide you on the most serene body scan to take you
to an even deeper level of calm deeper down into hypnosis
continue your journey to sleep as your relaxed attention flows easily
from one part of your body to another
subtly moving your energy to soften your body
and let go into the support of the surface below you
your body is safe and supported
and knows exactly what to do to relax
your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you
or needs your immediate attention
now become aware of the top of your head
can you feel this area from the inside of your body as sensations only
now move your attention from the top of your head
to your forehead and feel a sense of softening
and smoothing here
notice your eyes and relax the muscles
in and around your eyes as well as your eye sockets
become aware of your cheeks inside your mouth and outside
continue to relax even deeper here
as you feel the tension from this area melt away your entire body softens
a little further
feel the hinges of your jaw release
allow your teeth to part and relax your tongue
[Music] this softening of your face and jaw
will deepen the relaxation of your entire body
become aware of your throat as it softens
notice how deep and calm your breath has become
as you continue to relax deeper and deeper
allow this wave of comfort to continue its journey down your body and sense
your shoulders release and rest heavy
sense the relaxing of your arms elbows wrists
and hands [Music]
let your chest and abdomen fill up with breath
and then rest heavy with each exhale
sensing the comforting weight of gravity to experience ease
and now inviting the relaxation to continue its path
down your body sense your hips release completely
no need to hold on here
sense the area of your lower back
and linger on this area a little longer
as you ask your body for a sense of ease
welcome this comfort to move down into your thighs your knees
shins and calves
feel as a relaxing energy flows through your body to your feet
[Music] find comfort in your entire body now
your nervous system is shifting you are shifting
you have created change and you are now in a very calm
state of relaxation
as you drift further into this deep state of awareness
you understand that you can connect with your true confidence and build upon it every day
you can sense this shift you have an undeniable connection to
your deepest confidence and you are ready to let go of old negative patterns
around your confidence and easily replace them with positive
habits for good
as you continue to drift to a deeper level you know that you have an amazing power
to tell your mind exactly what you want and you know your mind listens
understanding this gives you the freedom to have the life you desire
from today forward you make it a point of telling your mind better words
powerful words motivating words
that will encourage your confidence to build
as you go deeper into a totally relaxed state
you are aware of a wonderful transformation taking place in your confidence level
every day you are growing and realizing a new sense of self-confidence
this confidence gives you a sense of freedom to genuinely like yourself
you believe in yourself more and more with each passing day
your confidence is strong yet not too much that it becomes arrogance
you are developing this unlimited confidence and high self-esteem because you are
using the wisdom of your subconscious mind
you know that you matter in this world and you are worthy of all that you
desire
you have confidence that you can handle any situation you are presented with
you believe deeply that you deserve the best life has to offer
[Music] you are a happy and confident person
you find more and more every day that you respect yourself and therefore
others around you like and respect you as well
you believe you are a good lovable person who deserves all your wishes
[Music] you find that more and more you believe
these positive thoughts and they are becoming familiar to your subconscious mind
because you are enjoying this practice regularly the more you listen the better you feel
and my voice goes with you long after this recording is over
to support your confidence

these true statements are having on you
in a moment as you continue to relax deeper and deeper
my words will become your words speaking directly to your subconscious
hear these positive statements of truth as your own beliefs
let these statements move you towards confidence and self-worth
you don't have to do anything simply listen and allow sleep
to easily come to you your subconscious will listen
