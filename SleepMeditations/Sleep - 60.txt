hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this sleep meditation
hypnosis over the course of the next few
minutes we will journey through four different environments exploring peace
and relaxation in the context of each one of them at the end you will have the
freedom to select the right one for you attuning your spiritual surroundings to
what you need for health healing and your happiness
with this in mind allow a calm sense of expectation to rise in your mind and set
an intention to rest deeply and completely feel your body relaxed more
than it has in a long while all the tension in your body dissolving bit by
bit let every muscle in your body relax
even those in the place you normally hold tired this may be your forehead
your lips or jaw the back of your head
your shoulder blades your lower back
your belly your knees or ankles and
right down to the tendons in your feet
feel your whole body melt into wherever you rest and allow the surface around
you to support your body let's begin our
meditation so lying down keeping your
back straight as much as you can feel your body becoming more serene you are
still and peaceful in this breath and the next as you relax you begin to hear
the crash of water in the distance
as you sink a little deeper into relaxation it grows louder until you
yourself are standing on the banks of an enormous waterfall
it is morning and the sunlight catches the water as it falls creating thousands
of tiny rainbows in the spray around the cliff
the rumble of moving water is at once both soothing and awe-inspiring a
symphony of Earth's very essence tumbling around you take a moment to
breathe in this majesty
[Music]
[Music] as you look more closely at the
waterfall bill the cool mist envelop your face leaving dewy droplets on your
cheeks and Florida feel the vitality and
power of this place all around you in the warmth of the cliff bases
the gentle glow of the Sun the frothy
water around the Falls notice yourself
becoming karma beginning to let go of your worries and physical tension
allow yourself to breathe letting the rush of the water guide you
into a deeper relaxation
allow yourself to feel the slow transitions from inhale to exhale and
from exhale to inhale
note the tiny delicate paws in the center of these transitions that space
where inhalation ends but before exhalation begins
breathe as deeply or as shallowly as comfortable for you your chest moving
rhythmically and effortlessly as you sink a little deeper into relaxation
letting go of any worry or stress
if at any time your mind wanders simply bring it gently back to your breath a
calming gentle process of bringing air into your lungs feel any tension in your
body lift away with every breath you take nothing can hurt you here
enjoy these next few moments next to the waterfall letting your worries dissolve
under the relentless rumble of fresh rainwater
[Music]
[Music]
as you notice the sounds of the meditation begin to change allow your
imagination to follow your feelings to follow creating around you a magnificent
sandy beach waves break in crystalline
sprays and the call of seagulls eases your mind smell the sharp tang of salt
and the warm dustiness of hot sand
let your shoulders droop and your fora done crease
in the background you can hear the wash of the ocean waves breaking on the beach
you can watch the water if you like or close your imaginary eyes and simply
dwell in the presence of your other senses breathe and listen let everything
else go
so much of meditation is the practice of letting go of accepting that you cannot
control everything around you of welcoming in the infinite glorious
possibilities and opportunities that are waiting for you letting go of your
conscious discipline your task oriented nature is the gateway to relaxation so
taking a breath in
and exhale letting go of the need to
control your experience just for a few
minutes allow yourself to feel whatever arises letting go of everything negative
and treasuring the beauty of this moment's experience
as your body lets go of any tension your breath slows down and it may deepen just
a slight bit simply follow its rhythm
listening to the quiet in and out of air in your lungs if you would like match
your breath to the tempo of the sea nearby following the rise and fall of
the waves behind whatever feels most
comfortable most relaxing and embrace it
this is your chance to discover and choose whatever you need to rest
most fully
and again as the music and sounds of this meditation begin to change allow
yourself to be transported to the banks of a freshwater brook or river where
fish jump and the sunlight glints on the wet rocks
as you take a deep inhale you breathe in the burbling sound of water on stones
and the gentle sigh of wind in the young tree boughs take another deep breath and
then release it relishing the warmth of the air that leaves your body feel your
feet sink into the soft grass of the riverbank and notice the bright green
color of early spring if you would like
you may dip your foot into the stream noticing the way the water washes over
your toes cooling your skin
you can hear a few honeybees buzzing about enjoying the landscape as much as
you are you know that the bees will not harm you and so you can continue to
enjoy the gentle harmony they make a soft sound that sets off the silver
tinkling music of the creek
a little way in front of you a butterfly flutters on the breeze dipping and
soaring with the invisible current of the wind you hold out your hand and it
floats closer to you landing on your skin with an almost imperceptible touch
allow yourself to lay down on the riverbanks feeling the way the grass
molds around your body supporting your back and neck so you can relax more
completely above you you can see a
fluffy white cloud a clear blue sky
all around you are the sounds of nature peaceful and rhythmic
your thoughts disappeared replaced by this music of nature you can feel all
the aches and pains in your body dissolve away as you sink a little deeper into the warm grass relaxed and
at peace in this beautiful landscape give yourself permission to enjoy it
as you breathe you feel yourself growing lighter more relaxed almost as if the
stresses and tensions of the day are being washed away in the cheerful sound
of the river
breathe in welcoming inspiration and peace breathe out
exhaling worry and fear this is your
time embrace it now in these next few moments
and now as the music and sounds around you change one small breathe in and find
yourself on the path of a majestic and ancient forest the trail through the
forest is verdant lined with the carpet of the grass your feet sink into it's
slightly brushing against the soft coolness of its surface birds sing in
the trees a symphony of natural beauty
some chirp back and forth others trill
melodies into the wind a gentle breeze
sways in the trees and the soft touch of its passing soothes your skin
the sunshine is less bright here dappled and soft instead of its usual brash gold
the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to
and yet it is a soothing coolness filled
with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss
[Music]
[Music]
as you walk further and deeper into the forest the trees become larger their
trunks wider and spaced further apart in
the resulting space hangs a mantle of pearly fog floating a few feet above the
ground as you walk your legs stir the
fog and it swirls around you gauzy tendrils lazy soft against your skin
birdsong accompanies you along your journey lifting your spirit and soothing
your body with its innocent sounds let
your self marvel at the size of these trees as wide around as dining tables
and almost taller than your eyes can see
smell the dampness of believes and dirt underneath them nourishing and
protecting their roots imagine how far
these tree's roots must extend into the earth in order to remain sturdy and
upright above all allow the nature's
music to guide you into further relaxation
as you breathe deeply watching the sunlight meander back and forth as the
trees sway in the breeze bring your attention to yourself are you holding
any tension or is there any pain in your body are you carrying or holding on to
something in your back your neck or your
shoulders
is there tension in your hips or perhaps the way you squeeze your eyelid shut how
does it feel to be you right now
you are still and tranquil United with this peaceful an ageless environment
feel your body relaxing as you breathe a little deeper letting go of anything
that might distract you let yourself
focus completely on the beauty of the forest sense it feel what it's like
welcoming the harmony and stillness that accompanies it
[Music]
allow your attention to travel across your body noticing how deeply your
muscles and tendons have relaxed since
now the space between your thoughts the
ease with which your mind moves between thoughts never lingering too long on one
subject you feel calm peaceful and
daddy's now in this state of quiet peace
as this meditation spoken part comes to an end allow your mind to return to that
place savoring the beautiful details as you sink further into this state of
happy equanimity let your breath guide you and enjoy the final moments of music
as you drift off into a deep and peaceful sleep rest well my friend rest
well you
