for this practice make sure that you
have already done everything you need to
do so that you can fall asleep
immediately following the meditation
hit pause if you need to and come back
when you're ready
allow your body to get nice and cozy
lying down however feels best for you
but if possible
begin by lying flat on your back
arms at your sides
legs uncrossed
trust your body and if this is not
comfortable for you
just do whatever position is
either way
begin to gently close your eyes
allow your awareness
to turn inwards
tuning in to your breath and body
let yourself get curious
as you explore the way your breathing
feels
[Music]
feeling your belly rise on every
in-breath
and fall on every out breath
[Music]
allow the air to move freely
so you are not controlling it or
constricting it in any way
you let it flow naturally
however it wants to
[Music]
pay close attention to how the breath
feels at the tip of your nose
in your throat
[Music]
chest
ribcage
back
the sides of your body
and your abdomen
[Music]
as you observe these sensations
you let them be okay as they are
[Music]
your role right now
is to simply
observe
and allow
with a sense of kindness and acceptance
in your heart
[Music]
and as you observe your breathing
you also allow your body
to begin to feel
heavy
with the weight of gravity
[Music]
scanning your awareness
at your own pace
through your body
and letting go of any muscles you do not
need to use right now
feeling your body
releasing
relaxing
[Music]
and sinking
down
with the weight of gravity
allow yourself to feel
almost as if
you are glued to your bend
letting your body feel so heavy
you wouldn't possibly want to move
and instead
you just enjoy
how still
and relaxed
you feel
[Music]
and as you enjoy this stillness
you begin to sense
see
and feel
a dense and sparkling
green light
almost like the consistency
of a paste
rising up from the soles of your feet
wrapping up your feet and ankles
[Music]
in divine healing light
[Music]
flowing up over your shins and calves
offering up
the highest
most loving frequency of healing
[Music]
rising up through your knees
and thighs
[Music]
this gentle
healing energy
for your highest most loving good
continues to rise up
through your scent bones
and pelvis
into your hips
lower back and abdomen
[Music]
rising up
through your torso
over your ribs and heart
upper chest and upper back
[Music]
flowing down over your shoulders
arms and hands
[Music]
and feeling this loving green light
[Music]
rising up
over your neck
[Music]
head and face
[Music]
until you feel it wrapping up at the top
of your head
feeling your entire body now encased
[Music]
in this sparkling green
light
[Music]
this loving
energy
that you are activating with your
awareness of it
will remain with you
while you sleep
set the intention in your heart
let it serve you for your highest most
loving good as you sleep
assisting you
gently
[Music]
and lovingly
[Music]
trust
and know
that as you sleep tonight
you receive
dreams
and assistance with healing
for your highest
most loving good
it is
natural and it will continue
and assist you
all
throughout
your sleep
now
yourself
beginning
to drift
off
letting the soothing
healing sleep
begin
[Music]
as you enter into
the perfect
healing
sleep
for you
now
[Music]
