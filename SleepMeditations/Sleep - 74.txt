release all mind matters a meditation just prior to sleeping begin to find
your connection to yourself a constant unbreakable tie that might have been
silenced or ignored throughout the course of a busy day only you know what
you went through today and only you can begin to release its hold on you
tomorrow will be another day but for now this is time just for you
time for stillness clarity and
relaxation finding a comfortable place
either seated or lying down and taking a breath breathing in
and release let that breath go and again breathing in
and release let that breath go
in and let go
as we get further in tation relax even further over the course of
our time together we examine everything your mind dwells on and use your breath to release
everything in preparation for a deep and healing rest
if it helps you imagine that you are passing these worries on to a higher
power or greater wisdom in the universe allowing this presence to carry your
burden until you elect to pick it back up again if you find this challenging
simply imagine your thoughts melting dissolving or blowing away according to
what feels most natural to you let's
begin
the beginning portion of any meditation practice is the most challenging give
your mind permission to take a break from all its work this is time for rest
and healing take a deep breath in
and exhale
as you breathe start to let go of your expectations for this meditation
everything is happening as it should even if you don't realize it even if you
don't see it even if you don't expect it to especially then
underneath it all lies a web of connections and new and beautiful
threads are being added every day
breathe deeper and that someday soon you will be able to
find meaning in what might at first appear to be a giant tangle
you do not need to look or sound a certain way to find deep peace and contentment follow your heart and
intuition slow and effortless
is a time now for letting go
this may be a guided meditation but it is not a scripted meditation it's up to
you to find your place your breathing and your Zen within it you are guided
not led and this practice is your own so
make it yours as you breathe in and exhale
sink deeper and relax relax

this meditation is a sleep meditation but it is okay if you do not fall asleep
at the end of it ultimately this meditation practice is about gaining greater calm and stillness
within your own life take a deep breath in and exhale feeling the microscopic
changes in your body as you do this
trust that your body knows what it needs if you fall asleep before the end of
this recording perhaps you are in need of a little extra rest and if you make
it all the way through your body desires a relief from the physical pressures of
the thoughts that are weighing you down right now nothing here is good or bad
right or wrong you are simply you caught
in a current of ever deepening relaxation embrace these since a
even as you let go of your expectations for sleep
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] if you are upset about your own watered expectations for yourself release them
plants goals hopes dreams intentions
desires whatever you name them let go
letting something or someone else carry them as you rest
you may reclaim them whenever you desire but for now simply breathe
trust that everything is happening at the correct pace trust that things are
happening in the right order know that everything even the gray
successes look like failures in the thick of things
you have permission from yourself and others to rest to tend to your own
well-being and sometimes the person who needs this reminder most is you
and so breathe a little deeper because you can
allow your limbs to relax a little further because it's possible
and give yourself permission luxurious decadent permission to fall deeply and
powerfully asleep it is not a command
only permission your body may do whatever it pleases sinking even deeper
into the peace and comfort of the present moment
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] it does not matter what you are worried
about at this moment know that there are thousands of other people in the world
undergoing the same or similar pain concerns about health appearance money
Korea relationships in the future we all
share these worries and yet for every person in pain there
are two people or beings or presences sending them positive energy and blessings at this very moment if you
have the strength send your own loving healing energy out into the world
extending love and hope to your fellow humankind and on your next inhale feel
it returning to you magnified by the light of a thousand beautiful souls
worry is just that worry it will not chain
anything it will not improve anything it
will only tempt you and snare you keep you from the deep restful sleep you so
deeply desire so give yourself
permission to let go of the worries all the worries give even this anxiousness a
chance to relax this is your space to
heal and to breathe
[Music]

as you listen to the sounds of this meditation feel yourself sinking even
deeper into relaxation your mind is soft
your body's still uncomfortable every part of you is at peace nothing disturbs
you if a stray thought or musing should
appear simply breathe it away returning
to this state of tranquillity and with each breath your body relaxes a little
further the thoughts come slower and slower until you realize that it has
been a very long time since your mind was occupied with anything other than
the serene sensations of rest allow your
breath to guide you deeper easing you into a more profound state of relaxation

with each breath you feel your mind body
and spirit becoming more closely aligned
any leftover thoughts from the day continue to dissolve muscles tendons and
ligaments often more doubts and
uncertainties fade away this is the
essence of peace of finding the spaces between your inhale and your exhale of
finding the serenity in daily life
breathe and imagine your scalp relaxing
the creases in your face loosening your
tongue unsticking from the roof of your mouth each tendon
your neck let's go every bone in your spine separating gently returning to the
natural state of balance it all happens
effortlessly relaxation increasing with each deep inhale and long exhale
just breathe and allow your body to slip a little deeper into relaxation
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you are here grounded in the present moment still and comfortable and fully
relaxed your body is heavy and your mind
is at peace lulled deeper into sleep with each
passing strain of music and deep breath
nothing here can disrupt you can lure your way
sleep is inevitable a heavy blanket that wraps around your limbs peaceful and
loving and infinitely caring
welcome it brace it
joy its presence E as you listen to the music of the end of this meditation
and when you are ready let it lull you into a deep restorative sleep
while my friend rest well
