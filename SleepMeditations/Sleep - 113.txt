[Music] a busy overthinking mind can feel like stormy weather the wind and rain of
a storm is threatening and may feel overwhelming whatever the reason
or the exact experience of overthinking or overwhelm it may not be possible to control your
situation what you do have control of is your response
to your situation no matter the weather in the world outside yourself
you can cultivate calm from within and sleep peacefully tonight
[Music] let go of the storm of an overactive
mind and enjoy a healing restful deep sleep tonight
[Music] while you sleep build a positive outlook
and a calm state i'm sarah raymond and i invite you to
join me in an oasis of tranquility tonight as you trust yourself and your inner
strength to calm the storm and allow sleep to easily come to you
your body and mind know what to do to experience deep healing sleep
even if you have had difficulty sleeping at some point in your life tonight sleep will easily come your way
i invite you to make yourself comfortable settle in as this practice takes you to
a deep healing level where you are able to connect to the calm within
close your eyes and allow my voice to be your guide into relaxation
your hands over your heart making both a physical and energetic connection here
set your intention to welcome tranquility within
to allow sleep [Music]
this intention is a signal to your heart and spirit that you are choosing
to take care of yourself which builds confidence
and self-worth
[Music] in a moment as i guide you into
a soothing scan of the physical sensations of your body
you may notice the stormy weather of your mind or body
and you can recognize that you are not the storm
as the quote goes you are the sky everything else
it's just the weather
you can feel safe knowing you are pure peace no storm
can reach the place of blissful tranquility within you
notice your physical experience now
when you look within yourself what is the first thing you become aware of
[Music] let your focus linger here for a brief
moment [Music]
breathe a calm slow breath into this area
notice any areas of your body that may be holding on to either physical or emotional
tension unintentionally [Music]
again breathe a calm slow breath into these areas
like a storm beginning to slow [Music] and let up
[Music]
with your mind's eye notice the palms of your hands now
notice the energy here
perhaps you feel this as warmth or tingling
or a buzzing sensation
this may even feel like the persistent rhythm of rain in a storm
[Music] notice how simply moving your awareness
to this part of your body moves your energy to this point
here you can calm the intensity of the storm by simply paying attention
[Music]
you can move energy and move a positive sensation
within you [Music]
you can feel safe knowing you are pure peace
and pure love
no storm can reach the place of blissful tranquility within you
now begin to widen the experience of your sensations
outward from your hands
become aware of the sensations throughout your entire body
feel the energy moving within you [Music]
be in your body inhabit your body fully
simply allow your focus to tune into the sensations
of your body right here right now
move your attention now to notice the sensations of your face
with each natural breath let go
of any holding in the muscles of your
face relax your forehead
the tiny muscles in and around your eyes [Music]
and relax your cheeks [Music]
unclench your jaw and sink into the support below you
continue to calm the stormy weather
and relax as you soften the muscles
of your neck and shoulders
relax your arms
invite the feeling of comfort and ease to move into
your back now
let go of any tension or gripping in your belly and your hips
[Music]
welcome the relaxed comfort to move into your legs
invite the sensation of relaxation to let everything go
you are now very relaxed
you are enjoying a sense of inner peace [Music] that is soothing your mind and body
slowly complete one more scan of your body sensations
from your head all the way down to your feet going
deeper into relaxation
as you do breathe a calm slow breath into
any areas that need to let go
deeper into calm
like a storm beginning to slow and let up
the simple act of looking inward and acknowledging your experience
can have the powerful effect of being able to soften
and release that which you are holding on to
you have the ability to come home to yourself any time you need
simply connect with the sensations in your physical body
with love and kindness
and this has the power to relax your nervous system
find comfort in your entire body now
your nervous system is shifting
you are shifting [Music]
you have created change and you are now in a very calm
state of relaxation the perfect state to welcome
sleep
you are exactly where you need to be
there is nothing you need to do or accomplish in this moment
[Music]
allow my soothing words to flow effortlessly through you to welcome
deep healing sleep
if your mind wanders come back to the sound of my voice
and the relaxing words i am saying
invite the weight of the day to be released from your shoulders
there is no need to carry it any longer
let go and drift effortlessly into peace
let go of any thoughts of worry any thoughts that may be holding you
back from experiencing tranquility
thoughts holding you back from sleep
see these thoughts drift away in the wave of relaxation
let go of anything you may be holding onto
from a time before this present moment
let go of anything that may be taking up space in your mind
welcome the calming of the storm
the peace and tranquility that is within you
[Music]
in a moment as you continue to relax deeper
and move closer to sleep [Music]
my words will become your words speaking directly to your subconscious
as you hear these positive affirmations open your heart and
open your mind to absorb and adopt
these beliefs as your own
hear them as truth in this present moment [Music]
let these statements move you towards a state of peace and tranquility
[Music]
you don't have to do anything simply listen and allow
sleep to come easily to you
your subconscious will listen simply believe these statements as true
[Music] eventually my voice will fade away
and you will enjoy healing sleep for many hours
and as you do these words will sink into your mind
