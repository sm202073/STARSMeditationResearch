welcome to the mindful movement i'm sarah raymond your guide into a peaceful
deep sleep for the night when your nervous system is wound up
in overdrive or you feel stressed this deep sleep meditation will help you
prepare yourself for sleep by activating the parasympathetic
nervous system and bringing you back to the rest and digest state
in this state you can sleep deeply and give your body and mind the opportunity
to heal and recover from the day this immensely relaxing practice
will send the signals of safety to your nervous system so you can easily drift to sleep
with a calm and clear mind if you happen to be feeling particularly
wound up or have some excess energy perhaps pause this practice and allow
yourself some nourishing movement or self-massage such as the practice i have
linked in the cards above and the description below if you feel ready now to settle in for
the night i invite you to make yourself comfortable
for the start of this practice lie down on your back if you are able
feel free to place a pillow under your knees to keep your back comfortable
very gently tilt your chin downward to sense the back of your neck
subtly lengthen [Music] place your hands over your heart if
you'd like to connect more deeply with your heart and your breath
[Music] although it may be dark and you may not
actually see anything with your eyes open and your head still
slowly move your eyes from right to left as far as you are able
continue this movement gently while you breathe fluidly
in and out through your nose
[Music] if it feels okay for you consider moving
your eyes right to left while looking up
and then a few times while looking down
continue breathing fully and easily
now bring your eyes back to center and blink a few times
allow your arms to rest and adjust your posture
in any way you'd like to be as comfortable as possible
to drift to sleep when you are ready
let your eyelids close softly
feel your breath and notice where your body moves in
response to your breath
and in contrast sense the still parts of your body
for the next several breath cycles intentionally breathe in slowly and deeply through
your nose and as you do tighten all of your muscles
make tight fists and squeeze your eyes shut
and as you breathe out slowly and deeply let it all go
if it feels right the exhale can be a deep sigh through your mouth
relax every muscle in your body
do this again for a few more breath cycles
breathe in tense and tighten
and breathe out you are letting go letting go
letting go
after you have completed this breath a few cycles
allow your breath to normalize and notice a sense
of peace wash over you
enjoy the state of complete relaxation [Music]
there is a freedom in letting go
as you continue to relax become aware of the physical sensations
in your body without expectations or judgments
simply notice
you may even imagine that in your mind's eye or your inner focus
is a spotlight that can scan through your body
focus inward and move your energy
[Music] you have the ability to release excess
energy as well as nourish where you need
[Music]
with a relaxed awareness slowly scan your entire body
shining the light of awareness from the inside
allow this light to move over each part of your body
noticing any areas that if possible
can be softened and released of tension
[Music]
whatever you are feeling is okay
in a moment i will guide you through a relaxing scan of your body
moving your attention strategically throughout your body
to relax your nervous system
[Music] your body is safe and supported
and knows what to do to relax
with a relaxed awareness follow the sound of my voice
and become aware of the souls of your feet
feel this area from the inside of your body
as sensations
if possible you can even let go of labels
or words with your attention
you can move your sense of flowing energy
[Music] this may feel like tingling or vibration
[Music] allow the feeling
and invite it to move and flow within you
wherever you need it by simply moving your attention
invite your focus to move from the bottoms of your feet
and now sense the top of your right foot
as you completely relax your foot
now sense the top of your left foot as it relaxes as well
since both feet relaxing together
allow your sensing attention to
begin moving up your right leg to your ankle
lower leg knee
right thigh and hip
your light of awareness has a softening
and smoothing quality as it moves through you
this comfort moves up your left leg
to your ankle lower leg
knee left thigh
and hip
sense the length of both legs relaxing together
give yourself permission to completely let go
and let your legs rest fully
continue moving your focus and energy up
as you soften sense the area of your lower back
[Music] as you linger on this area
ask your body for a sense of ease
let go of all the tension and tightness in this area
feel your body softening as each in-breath
creates space for an easy flow of energy
through your body
let your belly ribs and chest
fill up with breath and rest heavy
with each exhale sensing the comforting weight
of gravity as you experience ease
allow this wave of comfort to continue its journey
up your body as you sense your right hand
wrist forearm
elbow upper arm
and right shoulder
allow the entire length of your right arm to release
and rest heavy
now invite an ease to move into the left side of your body
sense your left hand wrist
forearm elbow
upper arm and left shoulder
[Music] invite in a feeling of tranquility
sense both arms release together
become aware of your throat as it softens
notice how deep and calm your breath has become
as you continue to relax deeper
and deeper [Music]
feel the right side of your jaw unclench
and release and
relax the hinge of your jaw on the left as well
now since both sides of your jaw
letting go completely [Music]
allow your teeth to part and relax your tongue
the softening of your jaw will deepen the relaxation
of your entire body [Music]
notice your right eye and relax the muscles
in and around your eye
and now the left eye
and sends both eyes together letting go
and now sense the top of your head
and relax any areas of remaining tension
let it all go
the simple act of looking inward and acknowledging your experience
can have the powerful effect of softening
and releasing that which you are holding on to
simply connecting with the sensations in your physical body
as they are has the power to relax your nervous system
find comfort now in your entire body
your nervous system is shifting you are shifting
you have created [Music] change and you are now in a very calm
state of relaxation
now that you have relaxed your physical body completely
your mind will be calm and clear in response
let your thoughts come and go
there is no need to attach to them or follow your thoughts
imagine your mind like a calm
still and crystal clear body of water
[Music] still water is reflective
and in response can offer you much wisdom
[Music]
allow yourself to move out of thinking patterns
and let your own inner wisdom be reflected
in your still peacefulness
now allow yourself to go deeper still
allow all of the thoughts to go
let your scanning awareness drift off and rest
when you pause focus inward
simply be your mind can be still
like reflective waters [Music]
this allows you to open into expansiveness
open into spaciousness
take a moment now to open yourself up
and be receptive open to any messages that arise
from your calm reflective mind
this calm and peaceful stillness is just right
to drift into sleep
you have shifted your nervous system
and relax your physical body so that you are in the perfect state
for a deep and healing sleep
your subconscious mind is clear
[Music] your mind and body are relaxed
as you drift into dreaming sleep
you will continue to experience a peaceful
and calm mind and body
your body knows exactly what to do to relax
as you drift my voice will gradually disappear
and you will be deeply asleep
when you wake many hours later
your body and mind will continue to experience
this amazing peaceful and calm state
you have practiced the ability to shift your nervous system
and you can be confident in this ability
whenever you need after this practice is over
[Music] you are so incredibly relaxed now
your mind feels calm
like still and reflective water
and there is an inviting sense of inner peace
flowing through your body
you are ready to rest your mind for the night
and when you wake many hours later [Music]
you will be feeling rested healed
and ready to move forward
