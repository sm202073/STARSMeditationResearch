heal from physical and emotional pain while you sleep
relax your body and mind let go of resistance to any pain you currently
have have had in the past or any expectations
of pain you may resist pain because you don't like to be
uncomfortable as this is human nature this causes the pain to be pushed down
and not processed and then released this resistance to the sensations in
your body and the negative associations with these feelings
can cause additional suffering while this meditation practice is not a
substitute for medical treatment if needed it can help to ease the suffering and
help you find the positive to connect with
i'm sarah raymond from the mindful movement and i'm honored to be your guide into
blissful pain-free relaxation to help you experience a deep healing dream state
of sleep tonight now let's begin i invite you
to make yourself comfortable
settle into ease to prepare yourself for sleep tonight
take a moment to create a safe space for you to drift into sleep for the
night close your eyes when you are ready
to bring your attention to your inner
self
take a few breaths in through your nose
and out through your mouth like a sigh to send a signal to your mind
and body that it is time to shift into rest
this is a message that you are safe and supported
to relax and let go of any pain
feel the shift beginning to happen for you notice
the power of your breath in this journey of relaxation
as the sense of ease in your body continues to expand
become aware of your internal energy
without making any changes simply notice how you are beginning this
meditation practice
what is showing up for you right now
notice without judgment
and without expectations
the physical sensations you experience are your body's way to give you
a message
it is your body's way to ask you to pay attention to what is most needed
if those signals are ignored or suppressed they will continue
showing up and eventually they will become more obvious
and impossible to ignore
recognize what you are feeling in this moment
as you acknowledge your experience allow it to be just as it is
with acceptance
this is not to say you are giving up you are simply not adding more suffering
by resisting reality
invite ease into the areas that may be asking for your attention
approach this practice with acceptance as you give yourself permission
to have whatever your experience is
let go of resistance
let go of judgment
practice surrender
now begin to move your attention slowly over your physical sensations
begin at the top of your head and scan your body's sensations
from the inside with a flowing attention
all the way down to the soles of your feet
as your attention flows from one part of your body to another
pause and linger on any areas that seem to be
asking for your attention
give each of these sensations the notice that it is needing
your physical body is your anchor or your reminder for this meditation
so if you find that your mind has wandered off into a story or thoughts about
something else lovingly bring it back to the current
experience of your sensations
notice any areas of your body where you are experiencing feelings
and simply be with the sensations without labeling good or bad
or telling a story of why these sensations are here
stay with the felt sense of the sensation
and let go of your ideas about it
welcome anything and everything you are feeling
be with the actual experience of your body
and let go of your resistance to this experience
what would it be like for you to encourage a release
a letting go of any tension as you move your awareness around
your body
let go of your attention and attachment to what isn't working for
you
let go of what is no longer serving you
this tension may have been there to serve you at one point
but now you can let it go
perhaps it resonates with you to visualize a letting go
you may see a beautiful bird fly off into the sky
or a feather being carried by a light breeze
or any other visualization of letting go
that shows up in your mind
once your awareness reaches your feet bring it back to the top of your head
and begin again
this time as your attention flows through your body
focus on any areas of ease and softness within your body
sense the quality of this area even if it is the smallest area
fully experience an area of your body where you are feeling ease
sense all there is to notice about this ease within you
know that it is available to you
invite these areas of ease to
spread know that what you focus on expands
so welcome your sense of peace to move and grow
expanding outward
connect with what is good and allow the good to radiate outward
just like the rays of sun expanding outward in all directions
what would it be like for you to experience a feeling of love and kindness
for your body right now
breathe this in
stay with the good
the positive sensation that is already within you is an opening for your attention
go through the opening and invite in more of what is good
offer each and every part of your body love and compassion
you may find it difficult to send love to an area of chronic pain
or dis-ease that is okay do your best
to be with everything that is part of you
acknowledge the messages your body is sending you
and nurture yourself with love
stay with the sensations
continue to build the ease softness and peace
within you
send gratitude and love to each and every part of your beautiful
body heart and soul
what would it feel like to let go in any way that brings you deeper
into comfort
are there any areas that you can relax further
maybe you sense a shift as you allow your body to sink
down into the surface beneath you
let gravity settle over you
there is no need to hold against it anymore
there is no need to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders any longer
give yourself permission to enjoy letting go into relaxation
now is your time to be fully supported
to let go and relax anywhere you can
as you continue the journey into deep relaxation draw your attention
to your heart
visualize a healing light energy here
this is the light of love
the energy of love
this light surrounds you and holds you in a warm embrace
this can be any color that comes into your mind
invite this healing light energy of love
to move from your heart out to all parts of your body

and it heals you

as it travels throughout your body into your feet legs
and hips

to set off a self-healing ability
in exactly the way your body heart and mind need

your chest your shoulders
and arms
