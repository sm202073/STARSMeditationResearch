hello and welcome I'm Sarah Raymond from the mindful movement thank you for
joining me today for this guided sleep meditation to help you manifest your
dream life with confidence with this practice you can focus on being open to
change and growth while uncovering your values first I will guide you through a
complete body and mind relaxation that will bring about a sense of calmness and
allow your subconscious mind to discover what is important to you build
confidence and let go of anything that could be getting in your way you will
connect with the feelings you desire in your ideal life what you are thinking
about right before you fall asleep will set the tone for the quality of your sleep and your mind set for the next day
you have the choice to change the way you look at things you don't even need
to be awake to hear all of this meditation your subconscious will listen
before we get started make sure you are ready to drift off to sleep if you like
when this recording is over make your environment as dark and relaxing as
possible know that you are safe and supported and you can awake from the
state of relaxation at any time if you choose
and now I invite you to find complete comfort and begin to settle in let the
momentum of the day's events slowly come to stillness in your physical body as
well as your mind
close your eyes and bring your awareness to your breath no need to change your
breath simply take the time to be a
witness to this present moment just as it is
leave any judgments or expectations of what your breath should or shouldn't be
behind [Music]
notice how your breath flows in through your nose and fills up your body with
life
as it flows out each exhale takes with
it any physical or emotional tension as
if that tension just melts away from your body forever as you may still have
thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an
observer
allow the thoughts to pass by
and return your attention to your breath and to the sound of my voice as your
guide on this journey of relaxation and
discovery
now begin to deepen each breath in and
out
notice the stillness that comes between each inhale and exhale
as your breath deepens
invite your attention to rest on the stillness between the breaths take
another deep slow breath in making it
your deepest breath yet
and release your breath through your mouth like a sigh do this again filling
your lungs completely and then letting go letting go letting go
feel that all of the tension in your body begins to loosen as if dissolving
[Music]
invite your breath now to return to a natural rhythm
[Music]
continue to allow each breath to deepen your level of relaxation
[Music] give yourself permission to be fully
supported by the surface below you
be open to the possibilities that come with this state of comfort
as you move deeper into the meditative state and closer to sleep develop the
intention of letting go of expectations
letting go of comparisons
and simply discover with curiosity what
comes up in this present moment without
any judgments
allow yourself to be authentic to explore
who you are at the deepest part of your core
[Music]
and now turn your attention to the top
of your head and imagine there is a warm light surrounding you and protecting you
[Music]
visualize this light [Music]
see the lights color
know that whatever comes to mind is just right for you
see the glowing nature of the soft warm light
[Music]
has this light passes over your body it
progressively relaxes you and releases
each muscle from the top of your head
all the way down to your toes
as you see this light in your mind's eye moving over your body you begin to feel
your forehead soften and smooth [Music]
notice as your eyebrows and eyes feel as
if they are melting
the tiny muscles around your eyes release and you can feel your eyelids
becoming very heavy and your cheeks
relax [Music]
as you part your teeth
unclench your jaw and relax your tongue
the tension in your body dissolves away
allow your throat and neck to soften
and as you feel the muscles around your eyes let go and your jaw release notice
the rest of your body knows what to do
and we'll respond by letting go of any
held tension
this calming light sends a message to your mind and your body that you are
safe and it is time to relax for a deep
and tranquil night's sleep [Music]
you can see and feel the warm glowing light moving downward continuing this
progressive relaxation like a wave
washing over you
feel the tension melting out of your shoulders travelling down your arms as
if flowing out of your body through your fingertips
feel how each part of your body becomes
heavy and connected to the Earth's energy as you allow it to let go
[Music]
this connection of energy will support you on your journey of self-discovery
today with each breath
you notice your chest and abdomen begin to feel heavy and you sense that you are
fully supported by your surroundings and protected by this glowing calming light
as it continues the relaxation process
notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper
and deeper this light continues to move
down your body releasing the tension
from your lower back and hips your
thighs and pelvis feel very heavy and
sink down into the surface below you
[Music]
your knees and lower legs soften as your
body continues to rest heavy your ankles
and feet let go of any remaining tension
that your body may still feel to be
completely relaxed safe and supported
now take one more moment to scan your body for any residual tightness or
tension [Music] and then breathe into that area so that
you can completely let go and surrender
to the heaviness of gravity
and now your whole body is heavy and
strongly connected to the surrounding light energy
we are connected by energy in this world every living thing there are no gaps
between us we are exchanging molecules
with each other constantly [Music] just as the light surrounds and supports
you the energy of the earth is connecting you with every living thing
with the animals with the trees with the water
we are one collective energy
since this collective energy and allow it to relax you deeper
[Music] now that you are deeply relaxed begin to
use your imagination
visualize yourself outside on a wooded
trail take in your surroundings with all
of your senses
let the scene appear in your mind in whatever way you like
perhaps you can see the gentle rays of sunshine coming through the branches of
the trees
maybe you can feel the Sun as it casts a
subtle warmth on your skin let the
temperature be perfect for you
in the scene in your mind the air feels
pure and smells fresh and clean
notice how your feet feel as they make contact with the surface of the path
below you
look at your surroundings and take in all the sights of nature
it is peaceful and quiet on this wooded trail
you're in a space where you feel your body remain in its calm and relaxed
state then you are feeling very safe
here
now in your mind begin to walk along the
trail as you walk you notice there's a
small lake on one side of the path in the distance
and although the water is calm you can
hear the noise the water makes as it moves with the gentle breeze
you continue walking along the trail in the direction of the water slowly moving
step by step remaining calm and relaxed
when you get to the sloping bank of the water you look out to see the sparkling
reflection of the trees and the Sun
[Music] on the glassy surface of the water
standing on the bank of the lake you feel your feet on the earth and feel the
Earth's energy come up through your body as if you had grown roots down into the
dirt
taking in this energy it grounds you and centers you
[Music] you can feel this energy all the way up
to your head and all around you
protecting and supporting you
you can feel the Earth's energy in your heart and your soul
this energy relaxes you even more deeply
this energy is pure love

you firm and strong they are growing
down deep into the soil to support you through the strongest winds the most
challenging of times

in this loving energy bring it in word
and at the same time expanded outward
as you sense this energy explore what
you are feeling in this moment simply
feel the sensations that arise for you

strong roots will support you on your journey of discovery and growth
