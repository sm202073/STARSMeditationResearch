hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation to
help you release all muscular tension and to help you fall into a deep and
peaceful sleep of this meditation you will be guided to
bring your awareness to each area of the body to feel into it to tighten it and
then to release it completely allowing the entire body to come to a state of
total relaxation so before we begin this
journey just ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of if you require
an alarm to be set just quietly set it now if there are blinds that need to be
drawn or bright lights that can be turned off just take care of these small
matters before settling into a comfortable lying down position
[Music]
wherever you are and sure that the spine and neck are straight but relaxed and
that you are supported in any way that you need take your time to adjust any
cushions or blankets so the gyrus comfortable as possible in
this very moment [Music]
set an intention now to fully let go through both body and mind as we enter a
process of complete release now let's
begin by becoming more mindful of this exact moment in time and space begin by
drawing your awareness to your ears and to all the sounds that you may currently
be infiltrating through them
you open your hearing simply observe all the sounds that come from subtle hums to
more prominent noises outside you
without judging or labeling these sounds practice remaining in a state of deep
awareness as vibrations filter into your eardrums and as they disappear
allow the Mayans tendencies to categorize to label and the judge to
step aside as you simply witness these noises as dynamic expressions of life as
simple and subtle vibrations of energy
now expand your awareness of this present moment by beginning to observe
the physical space you rest in notice
the air that touches your skin and the material world that supports and
surrounds you [Music]
take a few moments to observe each inch of your body that is in contact with the
physical world [Music]
you might come to notice the temperature of your body and surfaces around you you
might observe the textures of blankets and pillows that brush against your skin
[Music]
and you might even observe a barely describable feeling of support of safety
or of heaviness as you sink further into
the surface beneath you
[Music]
[Music]
notice if the body's formation or sensory experience changes in any way as
you become more mindful of this physical space you are in
[Music]
become more mindful now of your breath quietly observing the rhythm and depth
of its present form [Music]
[Music]
to be mindful does not mean to change or to manipulate the present moment in any
way that the mind deemed to make better or worthy to the contrary mindful
awareness asks us to open to and to accept this moment exactly as it is so
with this in mind see if you can open to your breath exactly as it is right now
releasing any judgment or expectation for it to feel any differently than it
presently does [Music]
if a natural deepening occurs allow this
simply noticing it as a natural movement of energy further into your being
[Music]
continue to observe the breath for a few more moments feeling into the expression
of each inhalation and each exhalation
notice the feeling of air entering through your nasal cavity filling your
lungs and pressing upward against your
belly [Music]
and then notice the same dynamic movement in Reverse observing any
sensations connected to your fall exhalation [Music]
just breathe here in mindful awareness for a few more silent moments
[Music]
if the mind wanders at any point during this meditation see if you can refrain
from judgment as you compassionately call your attention back to the present
moment it is in the minds nature to wander but with that said we can use the
power of our intention to refocus our attention back on this present moment
this refocusing is what helps us to enter an expanding state of complete of
relaxation
in just a few moments we will enter into a full-body scan through which you will
become deeply aware of the presence of tightness in the body and then of the
feeling of complete relaxation you will
be guided to witness tighten and release each area that we pass allowing each
part of the body to come to deep rest and complete ease in preparation for a
peaceful night's sleep [Music]
as much as possible see if you can align tightening movements with your
inhalations and all movements towards release with your exhalations
just breathe naturally in between each muscle group that we work on
[Music] so before we begin into this body scan I
invite you to make any adjustments now that will help you to feel into the
entirety of your body you might find that it is easiest to access each muscle
when in a straight line down position on your back however if this is not
comfortable for you come into a position that is as neutral as possible while
remaining comfortable
ensure that the chest is open with shoulders drawing away from the ears
allow your breath to continue to be in the background of your awareness
secondary only to your gently shifting awareness of the physical body so begin
by noticing your toes feeling into them exactly as they are in this moment
notice if there are any sensations present any tiredness or softness
[Music]
and now consciously tighten just your toes on your next inhalation observing
what it feels like for them to be pulled inwards completely and then exhale
letting them go and allowing all tension melting away with ease [Music]
now bring your awareness towards both feet toes and ankles included observing
them exactly as they are in this moment
on the next breath in tensor muscles in the feet area holding tightly for just a
brief moment and then release all of the tension on your exhalation allowing your
feet toes and ankles to rest back down completely and breathing normally for a
few moments [Music]
observe now the presence of both of your lakes drawing your awareness all the way
from your heels up to your hips noting any sensations you pass along the way
hold the entirety of both legs in your awareness and then inhale as you tighten
these muscles squeezing them in towards
your midline hold there for a moment and
then exhale releasing them completely into the surface beneath you
[Music]
moving to the area between the hips draw your awareness to your pelvis on your
next breath in tighten all of these muscles holding them for just a brief
moment and then release them completely on your next breath out just feel into
this complete release from your pelvis downward letting each of these areas
sink further into the support of the physical world
[Music]
observe the stomach region now becoming aware of its present state
and then as you inhale tighten all of these core muscles holding them in
tightly for just a moment as you hold the breath in and then release entirely
as you exhale softening all muscles around the belly return to your natural
breathing rhythm as you relax the stomach completely
[Music]
now expand your awareness of the stomach to encompass the entire tosser from
lower back to upper and from belly up to the shoulders take a moment now to
observe each muscle group in the core of your body
[Music]
now on your next inhalation tighten them or towards the midline of your body
feeling them in a contracted state and then release heavily with a sigh
allowing your entire torso to relax completely [Music]
take a moment here to reconnect with your breath mindfully observing its
present form [Music]
bring your awareness now to your hands fingers included observe the way they
are resting in this moment noticing if they are relaxed or tense or somewhere
in between [Music]
as you inhale allow all of these muscles in the hands and fingers to tighten
coming into a compressed fist hold for a
brief second or two and then exhale as you release allowing both hands to rest
completely relaxed
[Music]
draw your awareness now from your wrists all the way up to your shoulders and
compasses all the muscles and areas in between so inhale as you contract all of
these muscles perhaps pulling them up towards your ears and then soften releasing all of
these muscles in the limbs back down shoulders falling back down gently as
well notice how different it feels in
both body and mind between your contracted States and your
softened ones
now begin to observe all of the intricate muscles in your face noticing
if there are any sensations present here
consider the muscles in your jaw your
cheeks your eyebrows and your forward
[Music]
now inhale as you contract all of these muscles squeezing your entire face
together hold for just a moment observing the sensation and then exhale
as you release all of these muscles completely let go of each muscle
allowing all tension to drain away [Music]
take a moment to come back to your breath for just a moment observing the
entire body right where it is and right as it is
[Music]
observe this neutral state just for a moment
and then on your next inhalation contract every muscle group accessible
to your awareness squeezing the entirety of your body towards your midline hold
everything together with the breath held in and then release completely letting a deep sigh escape from your
lungs as all remaining tension and stress falls away allow each muscle to
melt into the surface beneath you
allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm as you sing further and
further into the experience of this complete relaxation
[Music]
continue to breathe naturally mindfully observing the flow of air into and out
of your being [Music]
in this state of deep relaxation and release there is absolutely nothing to
do but be entirely present
with every muscle group relaxed completely you are moments away from
drifting into a peaceful sleep that is in alignment with your present state of
tranquillity allow your breath to become
like waves your body is soft and gentle as the water beneath the service as you
breathe notice yourself being rocked gently into an even deeper state of
tranquillity
the mind follows the body's lead quietening softening
as you come into harmony with everything within and around you
with every inch of your being having been consciously relaxed allow yourself
to float effortlessly into a deep slumber allow your breath and the sounds
to soothe your entire being as you slowly but surely descend completely
into restorative and peaceful night's sleep
and allow these affirmations to sink into your subconscious mind even if you
do fall asleep trust that these affirmations will assist you as you
drift deeper deeper into sleep
