I have a guided
meditation to help you relax
this practice is great for putting a
pause on a stressful experience or
negative emotions and simply connecting
inward and now let's begin I invite you
to make yourself comfortable
choosing any position that allows you to
feel fully supported
where you can relax
and let go
[Music]
choose a position that you know you are
safe and gives you the opportunity to
[Music]
focus inward
[Music]
perhaps close your eyes if you like
[Music]
and begin to settle in
[Music]
make any small subtle adjustments to
your posture patiently
think deeper into comfort
take your time
there's no rush here
you set aside this time where no one
needs anything from you or no
responsibilities for the next
little while
[Music]
let this be a pleasure for you to enjoy
[Music]
and as you settle into comfort
allow your attention to rest at the
sensations of your hands
[Music]
notice the palms of your hands
[Music]
and since the tops of your hands
[Music]
and notice all the way to the very tips
of your fingers
[Music]
and since both hands as a whole
[Music]
notice if there's a temperature
around the area of your hands
do you sense
energy
perhaps buzzing or a vibration or
tingling
[Music]
whatever you are feeling it's just right
[Music]
this practice is simply about looking
for what's there recognizing your true
experience
in this present moment
[Music]
can you sense a feeling of weight at the
area of your hands
maybe your hands feel very heavy and
solid into the surface below you or
perhaps I feel light as if
they could float off the surface below
you and drift into the air
[Music]
notice if there's a color around the
area of your hands that can be sensed
[Music]
and now with a relaxed awareness welcome
your attention to rest
on your feet notice the tops of your
feet and ankles
[Music]
notice your toes
[Music]
and the soles of your feet
[Music]
is there a temperature you are aware of
at the area of your feet
[Music]
is it warm or cool
[Music]
or simply neutral
are you able to sense heavy or light
at the area of your feet
[Music]
perhaps you notice a color when your
attention rests at the area of your feet
[Music]
is there an energetic quality at the
area of your feet
[Music]
allowing your attention to continue to
stay here at the area of your feet
[Music]
imagine bringing in energy from the
earth from all around you
[Music]
imagine bringing in this energy from the
soles of your feet as if they were
permeable
[Music]
the energy moves in from the soles of
your feet and it intuitively moves to
wherever your body needs it
[Music]
your body and this energy coming in from
the outside flow as if dancing together
[Music]
creating a beautiful flow of energy
filling you up
[Music]
where you maybe depleted
[Music]
moving excess energy where there may be
a buildup
since this energy swirling around you
flowing throughout your entire body
[Music]
letting go of excess energy through the
crown of your head and drawing in energy
to refill you from the soles of your
feet
[Music]
perhaps you can sense this energy
[Music]
like a warm embrace from a loved one
or perhaps it feels like the weight of a
heavy warm blanket
[Music]
stay with this flow of energy
[Music]
for just a little longer
allowing your body to connect with the
energy
[Music]
so that the energy knows where to go
[Music]
now sensing the areas of your hands and
your feet once more bringing some gentle
movements to those areas feeling the
energy building up at your hands and
your feet once more and take a moment as
we close the practice to connect with
that perfect level of energy feel it in
your body like muscle memory know that
you have the ability to come back to
this moment this sensation any time you
need it is already within you your body
knows how to find balance it may just
need a little loving attention and
encouragement
when it feels right to you open your
eyes I hope you have a wonderful day
