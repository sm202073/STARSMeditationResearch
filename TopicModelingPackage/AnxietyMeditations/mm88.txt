This is a 5-minute “breathing space” practice
that you can use anytime, anywhere
to regain calm, clarity and confidence.

To begin,
become physically still,
wherever you are,
either lying,
sitting,
or standing.

Choose a posture
where you’ll be as comfortable
as possible,
and lightly close your eyes.

Bring your awareness to
whatever is going on for you
right now.

Give the weight of your body
up to gravity.

Allow your weight to sink into
the points of contact
between your body and the floor,
the chair,
or bed.

What sensations are there right now?

If you notice any tension
or resistance
towards painful
or unpleasant sensations,
gently turn towards them.

Accept them
as best you can.

If you begin to tense around the breath,
then let go a little bit more with each outbreath.

Soften
into gravity.

Notice any thoughts
as they arise and pass through the mind.
