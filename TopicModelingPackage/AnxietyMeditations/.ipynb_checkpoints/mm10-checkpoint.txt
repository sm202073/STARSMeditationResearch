start by settling into a comfortable
position
[Music]
gently close your eyes notice your
attention is shifting away from the
sights smells tastes sounds and feelings
around you and you begin to bring your
focus inward
[Music]
notice the natural rhythm of your breath
[Music]
feel your abdomen expand with each
inhale
and feel the air as it leaves your body
on each exhale
[Music]
right now in this one-of-a-kind
irreplaceable blessed moment in time
there is nothing more important than the
present
[Music]
scan your muscles for any tension and
stop when you come across a part of your
body that is clenching take a moment to
honor this tightness breathing in a
breath of love and self nurturing and
then breathing out all of the stress
that is no longer serving you
[Music]
repeat this process of scanning and
releasing tension until your entire body
feels in harmony
if at anytime later in the day you
notice the clenching feeling coming back
simply repeat this practice of breathing
in love and breathing out tension and
through your breath you will be anchored
again in this present moment
[Music]
now take a moment to scan for any
clutter in your mind
[Music]
your mind is like your desk and you are
more productive when it is organized and
efficient notice if your thoughts are
disorganized darting from worry to worry
or if they are neat and purposeful
[Music]
is there anything you could put away or
get rid of to make your daily life
easier and less stressful
[Music]
now picture yourself clearing off your
desk putting things back where they
belong and getting rid of things you
don't need
[Music]
allow the image of you organizing your
desk to serve as a visual representation
of you clearing your unnecessary stress
[Music]
after clearing the clutter in your mind
your head feels and flow and your
thoughts come and go more calmly
you can now go through the rest of your
day
feeling more relaxed
when you are ready take one more deep
slow breath and then allow your eyes to
open you are now ready to take on the
demands of daily life and you have the
ability to clear the clutter again
whenever it piles up thank you for
taking time to practice this meditation
