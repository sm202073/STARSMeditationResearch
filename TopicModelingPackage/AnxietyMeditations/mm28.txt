thank you for
joining me today for this short guided
body scan to help you relax
and reboot this is the perfect
meditation for those times where you
need a quick break to allow your nervous
system to regroup and cultivate energy
for the rest of the day begin by either
sitting or lying in a position where you
can find comfort through your body take
a deep inhale through your nose and on
your exhale allow your eyes to close
now allow your awareness to shift from
the outer world to the inner world find
the observer within observe your breath
[Music]
be a witness to your body breathing in
this moment be a witness to this present
moment your breath is your anchor your
ever-present breath to this moment to
this life for the next few breaths
inhale deeply through your nose holding
it in at the top for as long as
comfortable and release your exhale
allowing your body to soften to soften
into the support beneath you
[Music]
now allow your breath to normalize
and notice you have settled in and are
ready to relax bringing your awareness
to the top of your head notice any
tension than the muscles around the
scalp
[Music]
on your next exhale let go of all the
tension in the top of your head allowing
your awareness now to drift down to your
forehead and as you exhale release the
tension from your forehead feel your
ears soften and your eyes begin to get
heavy moving down to your cheeks allow
your cheeks to let go
[Music]
your jaw on clenches and your tongue
gets heavy in your mouth
drifting your awareness down to your
neck allow your exhale to melt away the
tension in your neck
[Music]
perhaps you notice your shoulders are
beginning to relax and on your next
exhale allow your shoulders to
completely let go you are feeling very
relaxed now allow your arms to be heavy
[Music]
let your arms and hands release any
tension they've been holding on to let
go even further
further into a state of peaceful
relaxation allow your awareness now to
move to your back scanning from the
inside with a relaxed awareness up and
down your back and now as you exhale let
the muscles of your back relax and let
go let go of all of the tension from the
day let go of anything negative you are
holding on to relax your back and let it
all melt away
feeling your belly expand as you inhale
allow it to soften as you exhale
[Music]
allow a sense of ease to flow through
your body as you are drifting in to
comfort
you are settling into a very relaxing
and peaceful state of mind bring your
awareness now to your hips notice how
they feel
notice where they may be holding on and
on your next exhale allow your hips to
soften
[Music]
allow them to let go giving in to
gravity and sinking down further into
the surface below you
[Music]
now letting your awareness drift down to
your legs beginning with your thighs
relax your thighs let go of any tension
that doesn't serve you
[Music]
moving down now to your lower legs relax
your calf muscles release the muscles in
your feet
finding comfort in your entire body now
[Music]
your nervous system is shifting you are
shifting
[Music]
you have created change and you are now
in a very calm state of relaxation you
are exactly where you need to be
as you take the next few moments invite
[Music]
the complete relaxation of your mind and
body to linger over you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now slowly begin to deepen your inhales
allow your awareness to drift back to
the surface
returning to the space you are in
perhaps you can feel a shift you have
cared well for yourself in this practice
be proud of yourself for taking the time
out of your day for self-care you
absolutely deserve it on your next
breath with your eyes still closed
invite a smile to wash over your face
and bask in the light that is always
shining upon you no matter what
circumstances you find yourself in ask
for a few more breaths
[Music]
hold on to that smile feeling the
unconditional love and light of the
universe shine on you and now gently
open your eyes
