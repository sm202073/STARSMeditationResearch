So, to reduce anxiety,
start by taking a moment to relax your body,
soften any unnecessary tension in your belly and shoulder,
and find a posture that feels both relaxed and alert,

Rest your hands
in an easy effortless way.

With your eyes open,
take a few moments
to scan your awareness
through the sensations of your body,
and wherever possible,
soften and release
obvious areas of physical tension.

Let your eyes stay open
and focus on the middle of the room
wherever you are.

And then see how you can let your awareness travel across the room
from where you’re sitting.

If you’re lying down,
you can let your attention go upwards
to the ceiling.

And then notice
how you can let your attention come back
to the center of the room.

And see if you can bring your attention closer,
to about book-reading distance
as if you’re reading a book in your hands.

So clearly, you can determine where your attention goes.

And now
you can let your eyes close
and just let your attention go inward.

And gently focus on
the sensations of the breath
moving in and out of the body...

And you can let your attention go to wherever the breath comes most naturally to you.

For some people,
it’s the sensations of the air in the nostrils ,
with that gentle feeling coming in and out
as the air passes in and out at the nostrils.
