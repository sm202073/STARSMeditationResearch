Hello and welcome to this healing session for anxiety.

Get into a comfortable and relaxed position and just let go of all your daily stresses.

Allow yourself to just be here and now, letting your body just be.

You don't have to do anything because our bodies naturally want to be calm and relaxed.

Sometimes thinking too much or being tense and being anxious doesn’t allow for us to relax.

So naturally, we must let go of any need to control the present moment and future outcomes.

We feel anxious because we tend to over-analyze what we think will happen today, tomorrow or next week.

We do this out of habit because in the past, situations and outcomes that didn’t happen the way we expected, and we tend to feel that we need to be in control and be worried.

In order to change this habit, we must change our self-image and create new beliefs.

That's what this session will teach you, but first, we need to get in a relaxed state and go within, calming our mind with some breathing.

I will count down and with it number I say I want to fully inhale with your belly out and exhale tightening your belly.

And with each breath, you will feel more and more relaxed, taking you into a deep state of peace.

I will count down now.

5...Take a full in breath and as you exhale feel the tension loosen a little bit.

4...Take a nice deep breath in and as you exhale you feel even more relaxed and tensions let go.

3...Full breath in...and out.

Your mind is becoming calm and clear.

2...Inhale deeply and when you exhale observe how the need to control subsides as you become extremely relaxed.

1...As you take your last breath and exhale slowly you feel any tension is gone, and you are in complete peace and tranquility.
