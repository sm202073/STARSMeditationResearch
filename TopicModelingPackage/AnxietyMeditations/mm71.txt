begin this meditation
by getting into a comfortable seated
position
spine tall and straight
shoulders rolled back slightly to open
up your heart
let your hands rest comfortably in your
lap
when you feel ready softly close
your eyes
[Music]
focus all of your awareness now on your
breath
[Music]
begin by taking a nice deep breath in
stomach and ribcage fully expanding
holding your breath at the top
and when you're ready exhale powerfully
with a sigh
wonderful let's do this again
one more deep breath in stomach and rib
cage expand fully
hold your breath at the top
and when you're ready exhale powerfully
with an
audible sigh
and finally one last deep inhale really
make it count
stomach and ribcage expand even wider
this time
breath is held slightly longer
and when you're ready just let all
tension go as you exhale
with a sigh just return to breathing at
a pace that feels comfortable to you
for the rest of this meditation
notice how alive you feel after these
three deep
breaths
as you become more present with your
breath
imagine yourself lying in a field
of vibrant green grass
looking up as a pale blue sky with white
fluffy clouds
hanging gracefully in the air
imagine you are able to erase the clouds
with your mind
[Music]
as your thoughts clear so too does the
sky
above you
intentionally imagine the sky becoming
crystal clear
as now as a thought comes you watch as a
cloud
enters the sky you do not
judge this you just refocus on a clear
sky
each time this happens
the goal is to keep the sky as clear
as possible
[Music]
focus all of your awareness now on your
[Music]
breath
[Music]
[Music]
one more deep breath in
and when you're ready exhale powerfully
[Music]
focus all of your awareness on your
breath
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
take this clarity of mind with you as
you begin to bring your awareness
back to the room around you
[Music]
opening your eyes whenever you feel
[Music]
ready
[Music]
you
