welcome to a guided meditation for
anxiety
and depression on the clutter of the
mind
so let's start the practice by finding
our seat you can sit on a chair
or cushion on the floor
[Music]
and sit with your back upright but
comfortable
so before getting into the practice
let's just start by
acknowledging how we feel in this moment
and we don't need to add a story to the
way we are feeling
we don't need to judge it or try to
change it right now just be with it
part of suffering is that we suffer
that we suffer so we add
thoughts or stories that only
worsen what we're feeling
mindfulness is an open awareness and
acceptance of what we're experiencing in
the moment
whether it's good or bad
so let's start here with acknowledgement
and now let's start by taking in a
few big deep breaths
breathing in through the nose
and out through the mouth
and now close your eyes
let's place our attention now
on the breath
start by noticing each inhale
and exhale the
sensations around each breath
and where you notice the most
maybe you notice the rising sensations
in the chest
or stomach maybe you notice the
falling sensations around the body on
each exhale
and just be with the sensations
follow the rhythm of each in breath
and out breath with your full attention
and as we do this thoughts
may arise feelings
may surface and this is part of the
practice
if you are experiencing anxiety and a
bout
of depression right now
there will likely be thoughts and
feelings that attempt to
pull your attention away
and when this happens notice it
instead of resisting or
changing it see if you can actually play
with these thoughts and feelings here
see if you can become welcoming of them
and allow them to come and go before
returning
to watching the breath
and if you find yourself following a
thought or
feeling with more thoughts or
adding a story to them
gently pull your attention back to the
breath
watching the sensations of breathing
and as you watch the breath
and continue to notice thoughts
see if you can use the out breath to
release any discomfort
to release any unwelcome thoughts
sending them out with the exhale
so for the just that moment even if it's
very brief
the mind is empty
and allow any feelings that come up
to be acknowledged and sent out
with the breath as well
so that even for a brief moment
you are emotionally still and quiet
see if you can find those moments where
just for
a brief micro second
you are without any anxiety or
feelings of depression
and when you get a glimpse of it
it's tempting to seek it
but we're not fabricating anything here
or seeking it just allow these moments
to come to you
through mindfulness through watching the
breath
and resting in awareness
and now let's shift
our attention from the breath
into the physical notice
the contact that your body is making
your feet on the floor
your body against the chair
your hands in the lap
and notice your weight on the chair
or on the floor as well
and just be with the physical sensations
for the next
few moments
and now in the final few moments of the
practice
just let go
allow the mind to do what it wants
and go where it wants
and now open your eyes
thanks for having the courage and will
today to do
this mindfulness practice and i'll see
you next time
