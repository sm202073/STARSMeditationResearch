listen to this meditation when you feel
uptight tense or just in need of some
quiet peaceful time to totally relax
[Music]
once you have found a quiet private
place you will not be disturbed get
comfortable and we can begin
[Music]
I'd like you to get into a wall and
comfortable position so you can relax
easily settle down relax and make
yourself comfortable take a long deep
breath into your belly and exhale slowly
and as you breathe through your nose be
aware of the rhythm of your breathing
taking deep breath into your abdomen and
exhaling slowly
[Music]
and taking a slow deep breath deep
breath in exhale this time is for you to
relax
and allow yourself to have this time
just for you
[Music]
and notice the breath going in and
expanding your abdomen and then notice
as your body releases the breath and
your abdomen constrict
[Music]
and as you listen to my soft soothing
voice you feel relaxed and calm
[Music]
and as you continue to focus on your
breath simply breathing at your natural
pace you feel more and more relaxed
[Music]
and now I'd like you to shift your
attention to your body and the surface
where you may be sitting or lying
simply allow your body to relax
completely into the surface and enjoy
the support for your body that allows
you to totally relax
and as you allow your body to relax
simply take the time to notice out each
part of your body feel
[Music]
notice how your head and neck feel
[Music]
notice how your shoulders and arms let
go and relax
your hands and even your fingers relax
[Music]
simply notice how the sensation of calm
and relaxation travels along your body
[Music]
from your scalp
down your leg your shoulder
and notice the tingle all the way down
your spine
[Music]
notice how your breath allows your back
and chest to relax your abdomen and your
hips to relax into the surface beneath
you
notice how your buttocks will end
and as you continue to allow your body
to relax
notice how your thighs and calves relax
and let go
[Music]
notice how your feet and toes relax
[Music]
and notice the sounds around you now
[Music]
these sounds are all adding to your
relaxation and continue to breathe
deeply through your nose and deeply into
your belly in and out
[Music]
deeper and deeper
[Music]
more and more calm and happy
[Music]
deep healing belied wheezing
just let my voice and any of the sounds
help you to relax people they are all
part of the experience
[Music]
[Music]
and now bring your attention to your
mind allow your mind to simply let go of
any resistant thoughts that you may have
[Music]
allow any self-talk to gently dissipate
[Music]
allow your mind to relax and allow any
thoughts to simply pass
[Music]
and smile knowing how grateful you are
to take time out to heal your body mind
and spirit
and as you allow your mind and body to
let go just listen to my soft soothing
voice
bring your awareness back to your
breathing as you are now wonderfully
deeply relaxed
