Please find a sitting position
that allows you to be alert,
your spine erect but not rigid,
and also relaxed.

Now close your eyes
and rest your hands
in an easy effortless way.

Take a few moments
to scan through your body,
and wherever possible,
soften and release
obvious areas of physical tension.

We begin the practice of coming back
by establishing our home base.

While there are many possible anchors
such as sound or sensations throughout the body,
the most common
and the one we’ll be exploring here is
the breath.

Please breathe naturally
and simply notice where the breath is easiest to detect
and where the breath also feels pleasant or at least neutral.

So you might be paying attention to
how the breath feels as it flows
in and out of your nose,
you might feel the touch of your breath
around your nostrils
or on your upper lip,
or perhaps you feel the movement of your chest
or the rising and falling of your abdomen,
or perhaps you feel your whole body like a balloon
expanding with the in breath,
deflating with the out breath.

So just take some moments
to bring your attention
to the sensations of breathing in one of these areas,
a relaxed attentiveness.

There’s no need to control the breath.

Rather, sense you’re receiving the breath
much like you’d listen to sound.

With a relaxed awareness,
discover what the breath is really like
as a changing experience of sensations.
