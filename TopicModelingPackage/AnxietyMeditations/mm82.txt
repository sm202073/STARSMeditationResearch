Begin by taking a deep breath and hold it for 5 seconds…(pause for 5 seconds)…exhale and relax…(pause for 5 seconds)...take another deep breath, as deep as you can, and hold it, count for 5 seconds…(pause for 5 seconds) and as you exhale just imagine blowing out all of your stress…(pause for 5 seconds)...take a third deep breath and hold it…(pause for 5 seconds)...and as you exhale you blow out any stress you’ve been holding on to, saying to yourself “relax now”

[pause for 3 seconds, speaking now with confidence and at a normal pace of speech]

This is your new solution to stress.

Whenever you become stressed in the future, you simply take 3 fully in and deep breaths, holding it at the top of the inhalation for 5 seconds, and when you exhale, blow out any stresses that you feel.

And on the third breath as you exhale you simply say to yourself, relax now.

[Pause for 5 seconds] [speaking slowly with a soothing and gentle voice]

Begin by slowly blinking your eyes, and with each number I say, blink once. (pause for 3 seconds in between each number) 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.

Allow your eyes to gently close, and when you do this you feel a wave of relaxation sweep over you.

[speaking even slower now]

Now I’d like for you to focus on the sensations at the top of your head.

Just notice how the very top of your head feels.

[Pause for 5 seconds]

And now let your focus move down to your eyes.

Just notice how your eyes feel and ask them to relax even more.

The little movement in your eyes is called rapid eve movement and is completely normal.
