when you resist or resent difficult
emotions
you add unnecessary suffering to your
experience
[Music]
if you are able to recognize these
difficult emotions with love
and compassion you allow them to
move through you and can reduce the
added suffering
you can use this powerful practice of
being present
and nurturing these difficult emotions
with love and compassion
today you can use my guidance to start
and then use this practice on your own
anytime you need it
as we begin i invite you
to make yourself comfortable
as you settle into comfort
begin to notice your breath
as a way to come into your present
moment experience
allow your breath to be just as it is
and as you come into presence
welcome a softening
a letting go of any
hell tension
as your attention to your breath
allows you to relax just a little bit
further
[Music]
become aware of your physical sensations
notice if there are any difficult
emotions
arising
that are making it more difficult to be
[Music]
present
you might notice where in your body you
are feeling
this difficult emotion
[Music]
and if it feels right to you you can
place your hand
on that area
[Music]
this gesture
is showing you that you cherish yourself
do your best to let go of the story
around your emotions
[Music]
let go of any expectations you might
have
and simply feel the sensations
within your body
[Music]
this practice is
not about what you are experiencing
it is more about
how you are responding to those
sensations
[Music]
when you allow yourself to feel these
sensations
you have the choice to respond to them
[Music]
in a positive way so that
you don't allow these emotions to
control you
[Music]
right now as you're sitting in your
present moment experience
you are choosing to respond
to your emotions with compassion
and loving kindness
[Music]
staying in the present moment
continuing to notice
and accept your emotions
and your physical experience
[Music]
begin to inquire within
and ask yourself what is it
that would help me in this time
what would best serve
my experience
right now you have the opportunity to
let
go of the story
to feel your emotions
[Music]
and to meet these feelings with kindness
[Music]
you might offer yourself the phrase
i am here for you
or i love and care for you
just like a friend or a loved one
might offer support to you
[Music]
by showing yourself this love and
support
you can create a safe space
for your emotions to come forward
[Music]
and take the next few moments of silence
to offer yourself love
and nurturing to this area
where you are sensing strong emotions
if that feels difficult you might
imagine
this loving nurturing experience
coming from a loved one
[Music]
or this nurturing might come from some
other form of energy
[Music]
so
[Music]
begin to deepen your breath
let the inflow of air bring
more love more nurturing
to anywhere in your body that might
still
need it
[Music]
know that with each breath in
you have an opportunity
to pause
be with your emotions
and meet those emotions with love and
compassion
and now begin to become aware of your
surroundings
notice any sounds around you
[Music]
perhaps you begin to notice your fingers
and toes
once more
and when you feel ready take another
deep breath in
and as you let it out allow your eyes to
softly blink open
[Music]
and know that you can take this pause
recognize your strong emotions and meet
them
with love and compassion at any time you
need
come back to this practice as often as
you need
and i thank you for practicing with me
today
i hope you have a peaceful day
