a\cb3 \ \cb1 natural embrace of the day ahead before\cb3 \ \cb1 we begin I invite you to come into a\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable position whether that\cb3 \ \cb1 sitting or lying down ensure that the\cb3 \ \cb1 spine is straight your shoulders are\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxed and the neck should be aligned\cb3 \ \cb1 with the spine\cb3 \ \cb1 gently relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 so just take a moment to adjust yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 in any way necessary just to ensure you\cb3 \ \cb1 are comfortable and supported\cb3 \ \cb1 when you were ready allowing your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 to gently close\cb3 \ \cb1 to begin this meditation simply come to\cb3 \ \cb1 notice your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 without trying to change it without\cb3 \ \cb1 judgment or assessment\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the nature of it\cb3 \ \cb1 witness the way it effortlessly moves\cb3 \ \cb1 into the body and then back out\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 just become attuned to the natural flow\cb3 \ \cb1 of the breath as though observing the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath the full length of each breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 and out\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 as you begin to settle take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 witness the entirety of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 End mind our thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 often when we wake\cb3 \ \cb1 of our dreams\cb3 \ \cb1 and we hold on the thoughts about the\cb3 \ \cb1 days behind and the days ahead of us so\cb3 \ \cb1 simply begin to observe from a place of\cb3 \ \cb1 non-attachment whatever you may be\cb3 \ \cb1 carrying in the physical body\cb3 \ \cb1 just gently witnessing any areas of\cb3 \ \cb1 tension or discomfort\cb3 \ \cb1 and in\cb3 \ \cb1 breath to nurture these areas\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few deep breaths into each area\cb3 \ \cb1 of the body calling for your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 and then gently release them\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your body to sink for a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 into complete stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 and silence\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 in the same way now draw your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 to anything arising in the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 now there is no need to search for\cb3 \ \cb1 anything simply observe yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 open up to the thoughts that may be\cb3 \ \cb1 pre-existing\cb3 \ \cb1 they make themselves known just witness\cb3 \ \cb1 the nature of them\cb3 \ \cb1 the same way release them\cb3 \ \cb1 simply intangible ideas about what has\cb3 \ \cb1 come or what may be to come\cb3 \ \cb1 as you do this naturally notice yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 sinking further into this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 sinking deeply into this waking day\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever ideas you have about the day\cb3 \ \cb1 ahead I invite you to set them aside a\cb3 \ \cb1 short while\cb3 \ \cb1 you explore the moment you are presently\cb3 \ \cb1 in\cb3 \ \cb1 just notice through the physical body\cb3 \ \cb1 the surface that supports you\cb3 \ \cb1 you are seated on or the mattress you\cb3 \ \cb1 were lying on might be the floor\cb3 \ \cb1 quietly observe any sounds or physical\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations around you\cb3 \ \cb1 strong or subtle\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 and through your closed eyes notice if\cb3 \ \cb1 there's any sense of sunlight trickling\cb3 \ \cb1 in\cb3 \ \cb1 shadows dancing behind your closed eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 as you come to mindfully explore the\cb3 \ \cb1 world around you there is silence and\cb3 \ \cb1 stillness begin to make note of the\cb3 \ \cb1 presence of day\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 just continue to allow the breath to\cb3 \ \cb1 guide you through this gentle awakening\cb3 \ \cb1 of the senses\cb3 \ \cb1 noticing how you are inextricably linked\cb3 \ \cb1 through the breath to the world outside\cb3 \ \cb1 of you\cb3 \ \cb1 allow each in-breath to nourish you\cb3 \ \cb1 and each breath out to free you of any\cb3 \ \cb1 constriction fatigue or even thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 that may be lingering\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to be nourished through\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 as you open your heart to this new day\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 I invite you now to draw your awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 to your belly and as you do watch the\cb3 \ \cb1 way the breath flows in through your\cb3 \ \cb1 chest\cb3 \ \cb1 filling the entirety of your lungs\cb3 \ \cb1 causes the stomach to expand to rise\cb3 \ \cb1 and you might witness an expansion of\cb3 \ \cb1 the chest area as well an opening up of\cb3 \ \cb1 the heart space\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 if the mind wanders continue to simply\cb3 \ \cb1 invited back down and into the physical\cb3 \ \cb1 body\cb3 \ \cb1 wait for now simply embrace and enjoy\cb3 \ \cb1 these quiet moments of stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 presence and awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing yourself to tune into the\cb3 \ \cb1 energy of a gentle a natural expansion\cb3 \ \cb1 that comes with sunrise\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 now from this place of complete\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness and presence\cb3 \ \cb1 tune into the heart space drawing your\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness to the center of the chest\cb3 \ \cb1 and allow your heart to expand\cb3 \ \cb1 as it expands envision it touching all\cb3 \ \cb1 possibilities for the day ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 you might envision a white or a golden\cb3 \ \cb1 light radiating out from the heart\cb3 \ \cb1 making contact with the future that is\cb3 \ \cb1 continually unfolding\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 if you find any anxious or fearful\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts arise just witness them without\cb3 \ \cb1 becoming attached to them\cb3 \ \cb1 and gently focus back into your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 space or into the golden light radiating\cb3 \ \cb1 from this space within you\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 focusing now on your highest potential\cb3 \ \cb1 and visions for the day it might be\cb3 \ \cb1 goals that you want to achieve\cb3 \ \cb1 things that you want to set out to do or\cb3 \ \cb1 you need to do and allow any cluttering\cb3 \ \cb1 or limiting thoughts to naturally fall\cb3 \ \cb1 away and there is no need to force\cb3 \ \cb1 anything out of existence or to judge or\cb3 \ \cb1 condemn anything that might be arising\cb3 \ \cb1 less than your highest potential arises\cb3 \ \cb1 simply notice it acknowledge it and\cb3 \ \cb1 allow it to dissipate\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever we envision on a regular\cb3 \ \cb1 we start to manifest in the outer world\cb3 \ \cb1 consciously reflect for a moment on\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever it is your highest self wishes\cb3 \ \cb1 to manifest in your life or more\cb3 \ \cb1 specifically in the day ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 what is the deepest yearning of your\cb3 \ \cb1 heart\cb3 \ \cb1 what is the energy you wish to carry\cb3 \ \cb1 with you throughout your day\cb3 \ \cb1 continuing to feel into the hearts glow\cb3 \ \cb1 and compassionately allowing conflicting\cb3 \ \cb1 mental chatter to subside as a higher\cb3 \ \cb1 truth reveals itself\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to narrow in on what is it you\cb3 \ \cb1 wish to manifest considering for a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment that you already hold whatever it\cb3 \ \cb1 is you may take a few moments to breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 into this feeling as if it is already\cb3 \ \cb1 present within you\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your thoughts to be clear and\cb3 \ \cb1 conscious stemming from the core of who\cb3 \ \cb1 you are\cb3 \ \cb1 you might like to consider in the words\cb3 \ \cb1 of Rumi what you seek is seeking you\cb3 \ \cb1 just allow the openness of your heart to\cb3 \ \cb1 hold the truth that whatever you hope to\cb3 \ \cb1 embody is already here it is already\cb3 \ \cb1 present within you\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 just coming back to the body now and\cb3 \ \cb1 taking in a few more grounding breaths\cb3 \ \cb1 before setting a powerful intention for\cb3 \ \cb1 the day ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to be completely here\cb3 \ \cb1 truth\cb3 \ \cb1 to go and nothing you need to achieve\cb3 \ \cb1 as we increase our ability to be fully\cb3 \ \cb1 present\cb3 \ \cb1 and limiting thoughts begin to fall away\cb3 \ \cb1 and you begin to embody more deeply the\cb3 \ \cb1 truth of who you are\cb3 \ \cb1 silent and steady breaths here rooting\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself in the expanding energy of this\cb3 \ \cb1 morning\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 so from this place of pure presence\cb3 \ \cb1 but you now to set one more clear and\cb3 \ \cb1 powerful intention for your day consider\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever it is you wish to embody and\cb3 \ \cb1 state it to yourself as if it were\cb3 \ \cb1 already here\cb3 \ \cb1 for instance if you are longing is for\cb3 \ \cb1 self-confidence and esteem consider a\cb3 \ \cb1 phrase such as I am confident and\cb3 \ \cb1 complete\cb3 \ \cb1 or if the stability and safety are of\cb3 \ \cb1 your highest concern perhaps an\cb3 \ \cb1 affirmation like all of my deepest needs\cb3 \ \cb1 are being met\cb3 \ \cb1 just allow yourself to become very clear\cb3 \ \cb1 and focused on your intention as you\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to repeat it to yourself with each\cb3 \ \cb1 full breath\cb3 \ \cb1 so take a few moments of silence here as\cb3 \ \cb1 you align your intention with your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath letting the words fill you up\cb3 \ \cb1 entirely again and again but just a few\cb3 \ \cb1 moments\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 so wherever you are now resting come to\cb3 \ \cb1 notice once again with eyes closed\cb3 \ \cb1 environment around you feel into the\cb3 \ \cb1 physical support of the ground beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 of the material world it has been\cb3 \ \cb1 manifested around you\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can notice the air of the\cb3 \ \cb1 room that you are currently in\cb3 \ \cb1 sounds near far\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 take three more full breaths here\cb3 \ \cb1 knowing that you are unconditionally\cb3 \ \cb1 supported in this journey\cb3 \ \cb1 gently begin to soften the area around\cb3 \ \cb1 the eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you are ready slowly open them\cb3 \ \cb1 up to the world around you noticing the\cb3 \ \cb1 delicate transition from dark to light\cb3 \ \cb1 as you move forward in outward action\cb3 \ \cb1 continually come back to the intention\cb3 \ \cb1 you are carrying within you knowing that\cb3 \ \cb1 the universe is here to support guide\cb3 \ \cb1 and nourish you with every step that you\cb3 \ \cb1 take}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this guided meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 designed to help you ease into a deep and peaceful sleep while lowering your\cb3 \ \cb1 blood pressure naturally and effectively\cb3 \ \cb1 through mindfulness conscious breathing and deep body visualizations this\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation will create an inner experience of relaxation as well as\cb3 \ \cb1 guide the heart towards a healthy smooth and steady rhythm over the next short\cb3 \ \cb1 while allow my voice to guide you into\cb3 \ \cb1 this deep state of relaxation knowing that the hearts flow will follow suit as\cb3 \ \cb1 you sing further into stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 before we begin ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of\cb3 \ \cb1 any required alarms should be set and nothing else should remain on today's\cb3 \ \cb1 to-do list [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take some time now to settle into a comfortable lying down position using\cb3 \ \cb1 any blankets and cushions to support your body where needed if possible on\cb3 \ \cb1 the spine and neck should be in line to help open the flow of energy through the\cb3 \ \cb1 entire body tune in to your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 now as you make any final adjustments that will support your progression into\cb3 \ \cb1 a deeply relaxed and peaceful state\cb3 \ \cb1 I invite you now to simply bring your attention to your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 without trying to shift it in any way just gently open your awareness to it\cb3 \ \cb1 observing its natural flow rhythm and depth\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the way the breath comes and goes on its own accord\cb3 \ \cb1 guided by innate wisdom that does not require any effort on your part it\cb3 \ \cb1 simply comes and goes\cb3 \ \cb1 just as the ocean eps and flows\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you draw awareness to the breath notice if it naturally shifts in any way\cb3 \ \cb1 again there is no need to intervene or manipulate its rhythm but you may find\cb3 \ \cb1 that as you tune into the breath it might naturally deepen slow down or\cb3 \ \cb1 adjust itself in some other way just\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] notice if this is true for you and also\cb3 \ \cb1 notice if it is not there is no right or wrong way to notice the breath simply\cb3 \ \cb1 observe it however it comes and follow it wherever it flows\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 throughout this meditation the mind may entangle itself in thoughts of the past\cb3 \ \cb1 or in visions of what might come to be if for when it does simply acknowledge\cb3 \ \cb1 this tendency as a movement away from this present moment before drawing your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention back to the breath if thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 arise simply witness them for a moment with compassion and non judgment before\cb3 \ \cb1 returning to your unchangeable Center\cb3 \ \cb1 no matter how frequently they crop up no that is entirely normal for thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 to rise and entirely possible to gently\cb3 \ \cb1 let them go use the breath as your\cb3 \ \cb1 anchor at any point during this meditation to reground yourself in the\cb3 \ \cb1 physical place that you rest\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your awareness now to the stomach\cb3 \ \cb1 noticing its natural rise and for as breath moves through you\cb3 \ \cb1 in our busy day to day activities we often breathe primarily from the chest\cb3 \ \cb1 restricting our breaths range of movement this shallow breathing engages\cb3 \ \cb1 our stress response and releases a surge of hormones that temporarily increase\cb3 \ \cb1 our blood pressure [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as we naturally expand the breaths movement moving it effortlessly into the\cb3 \ \cb1 stomach we activate the relaxation response this deeper breathing pauses\cb3 \ \cb1 out of an inner state of stress and\cb3 \ \cb1 helps us to sink effortlessly into stillness and soon into a state of deep\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to focus your attention on the stomach noticing just how far the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 can go [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment now to acknowledge this physical place you are in\cb3 \ \cb1 without engaging the Mayans and our living capacity is it possible to simply\cb3 \ \cb1 witness the space you occupy to witness\cb3 \ \cb1 the physical world you are intimately connected to\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the service that supports you and notice any soft textures around you\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your awareness to this very simple moment knowing that there is nowhere\cb3 \ \cb1 else you need to be you are nowhere else\cb3 \ \cb1 but right here right now and all that is\cb3 \ \cb1 asked of you is that you open your heart and awareness to this beautiful moment\cb3 \ \cb1 before you fall into a deep and restorative sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you notice your physical surrounds you may also become more deeply aware of\cb3 \ \cb1 your physical body maintain awareness of\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath flowing through you as you begin to scan the body gently starting\cb3 \ \cb1 up the toes and traveling up to the crown of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing you need to look for in this process\cb3 \ \cb1 he was simply called to witness whatever exists within you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if any tension or discomfort appears in your awareness simply embrace it with\cb3 \ \cb1 your loving awareness and open your breath up to this area that is calling\cb3 \ \cb1 for your tender love and care if there\cb3 \ \cb1 are no strong sensations to notice simply grant your entire body with your\cb3 \ \cb1 compassionate attention and let it melt

future simply acknowledge the thought wave compassionately before\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing it back to the open space that it came from in this moment there is\cb3 \ \cb1 nothing view to figure out in the

notice your mind and body getting lighter and lighter\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the mind to sink further and further into the heart until nothing\cb3 \ \cb1 remains but a vast openness as clear as pale blue sky\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] now begin to imagine that you were looking\cb3 \ \cb1 up at this expansive blue sky from a beautiful open field you are resting in\cb3 \ \cb1 the center of it comfortably with cushions and blankets observing the\cb3 \ \cb1 freedom inherent in this natural landscape wildflowers grow abundantly\cb3 \ \cb1 throughout the sea of green that surrounds you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] above

feeling completely at ease within this landscape your breath flows smoothly and deeply as\cb3 \ \cb1 you allow the physical world to support you here [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 overhead something begins to appear out of the distance as it makes its way\cb3 \ \cb1 closer to the air space directly above you you come to see that it is an eagle\cb3 \ \cb1 soaring freely across the clear blue sky\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments to observe the smooth curves it makes as it wings and carves\cb3 \ \cb1 its way through the air it is both strong and light moving with both\cb3 \ \cb1 confidence and grace\cb3 \ \cb1 the Eagle continues to dance through the sky as it makes its way closer and\cb3 \ \cb1 closer to the earth it appears to be\cb3 \ \cb1 approaching the very field you rest in but nothing about its approach frightens\cb3 \ \cb1 you in some strange way you feel that\cb3 \ \cb1 this bird is no different from you and you know deep in your gut that in no way\cb3 \ \cb1 can it harm you in fact the eagle brings you a sense of\cb3 \ \cb1 inner peace courage and lightness you've\cb3 \ \cb1 heard much about Eagles knowing that their presence is an invitation to move\cb3 \ \cb1 deeper into freedom soaring high above\cb3 \ \cb1 the sky Eagles suggests to us that now might be the time to look at things from a new\cb3 \ \cb1 perspective these birds grant confidence and courage\cb3 \ \cb1 to look ahead they symbolize new beginnings self\cb3 \ \cb1 growth and personal awareness as you\cb3 \ \cb1 observed the Eagles flight you are blessed with its wisdom feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 refreshed and renewed [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you witness the eagle landing on the soft earth beside you as you rise to\cb3 \ \cb1 your feet to welcome its arrival the two\cb3 \ \cb1 of you meet eyes and then bow your heads in respect of one another with the great\cb3 \ \cb1 eagle just before you you stretch your arm out to touch its soft code noticing\cb3 \ \cb1 how calm and relaxed it is within this environment and in your presence the\cb3 \ \cb1 eagle is free unbounded by fear and anxiety as it welcomes your tender touch\cb3 \ \cb1 it reminds you that you too have nothing to fear\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing deeply soaking in this sense of freedom and on your next exhale you\cb3 \ \cb1 release all residual tension that lingers in body and mind you are\cb3 \ \cb1 complete at peace with this great bird knowing that in fact you are one and the\cb3 \ \cb1 same\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the Eagle takes one last look at you and turns preparing to take off once again\cb3 \ \cb1 preparing to set sail in the clear vast blue sky as the great bird turns its\cb3 \ \cb1 head you realize that by some divine magic you have become this eagle gazing\cb3 \ \cb1 up towards the open sky you realize that it is you who is preparing to take off\cb3 \ \cb1 to release everything that tethers you to the physical world to soar high above\cb3 \ \cb1 the earth free and unbounded the Eagle\cb3 \ \cb1 came for just a moment to show you that her way is your way that nothing stands\cb3 \ \cb1 in your way of experiencing what it feels like to be entirely free and\cb3 \ \cb1 suddenly in the midst of this realization you lift off from the\cb3 \ \cb1 security of the earth to experience a complete lightness in your being\cb3 \ \cb1 you saw ever lessly above the planet extending your arms with the same\cb3 \ \cb1 strength and grace shown to you by the Eagle that had once been with you now it\cb3 \ \cb1 is you now you are the eagle entirely\cb3 \ \cb1 free and unbounded by any and all earthly concerns within this incredible\cb3 \ \cb1 open stretch of clear sky you set\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself free you are entirely at peace with this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \

yourself this time to be full be at\cb3 \ \cb1 peace and fully supported by the universe around you you are fully\cb3 \ \cb1 supported here unconditionally\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly you begin to feel yourself coming back down to earth with the energy of\cb3 \ \cb1 the Eagle ingrained deep into your cells you know that you carry this energy of\cb3 \ \cb1 freedom wherever you go whether high above the earth or nestled into the\cb3 \ \cb1 comfort of your own bed with each exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 you sink a little bit further back down to earth back down to the surface that\cb3 \ \cb1 supports you in this very moment you\cb3 \ \cb1 settle now back into the earth gently releasing all visualizations of\cb3 \ \cb1 the Eagle the sky and the abundant field you once rested in even though you have\cb3 \ \cb1 returned to this physical space you still carry the wisdom of the eagle deep\cb3 \ \cb1 inside yourselves the feeling of being entirely free lingers within you\cb3 \ \cb1 come back once again to the breath bringing your attention now to the heart\cb3 \ \cb1 inside this space in your chest you may envision a warm white light beginning to\cb3 \ \cb1 appear with each breath it grows expanding softly and swiftly to\cb3 \ \cb1 touch each cell of your body soon\cb3 \ \cb1 your entire body is bathed in this warm white glow as you feel yourself letting\cb3 \ \cb1 go of this day completely as you feel yourself inching closer and closer\cb3 \ \cb1 towards sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the light begins to dim having cleansed your body and mind entirely this dimming\cb3 \ \cb1 invites you into a deeper and peaceful sleep allowing you to rest completely\cb3 \ \cb1 throughout another night you feel\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself sinking further and further into the surface beneath you everything\cb3 \ \cb1 within you that does not support your sense of relaxation has been released\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing else for you to do nothing else to be envisioned or thought\cb3 \ \cb1 of you are entirely at peace as the steady\cb3 \ \cb1 rhythm of your breath rocks you closer and closer towards a deep and nourishing\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] welcome to this guided meditation that\cb3 \ \cb1 will help you to find peace and inner tranquility before you naturally fall\cb3 \ \cb1 into a deep and restorative sleep over\cb3 \ \cb1 the next short while you'll be guided to relax the body and ease the mind before\cb3 \ \cb1 being led through a visual journey into a mystical cave of peace it's your time\cb3 \ \cb1 to allow yourself to be carried away gently through this journey knowing that\cb3 \ \cb1 you are entirely supported in this present moment so take a moment now to\cb3 \ \cb1 ensure that all end of day activities have been wrapped up alarms should be\cb3 \ \cb1 set and liens drawn you\cb3 \ \cb1 I invite you now to come into a comfortable lying down position ensuring\cb3 \ \cb1 that your body is resting with ease wherever you are you might want to use\cb3 \ \cb1 blankets or cushions to support you as you find comfort in the physical space\cb3 \ \cb1 you occupy take a few releasing breaths\cb3 \ \cb1 here allowing a deep sigh to leave your body on your next outward breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 to begin our journey into tranquility take a moment to observe that the\cb3 \ \cb1 stillness of your physical body [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as day transforms into night and the Sun fades away we are invited to enter a\cb3 \ \cb1 much needed period of rest and rejuvenation as we sink into the\cb3 \ \cb1 stillness of night rest assured there is nothing we need to consciously engage in\cb3 \ \cb1 or take care of we can trust that the body will work by its way of its innate\cb3 \ \cb1 wisdom so take a moment now to quietly\cb3 \ \cb1 observe the miracle of this body\cb3 \ \cb1 feel into its heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 you might want to notice now where there might still be movement despite the\cb3 \ \cb1 sense of stillness notice where breath brings subtle\cb3 \ \cb1 movement to the body how it causes the chest and stomach to expand on each\cb3 \ \cb1 inhalation and to fall away on each\cb3 \ \cb1 exhalation [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 observe how beautifully this gentle movement intertwines with a deeper sense\cb3 \ \cb1 of complete stillness as you take a few deep breaths here in silence\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if thoughts arise in the mind no that is entirely natural for them to do so as\cb3 \ \cb1 you become aware that your attention has shifted into stories about the past or future simply acknowledge these thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 from a more distant place than is habitual\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 while the mind can be useful at times it can lure us into an unproductive thought\cb3 \ \cb1 cycles when left to run on its own terms\cb3 \ \cb1 as we begin to witness our mental movements from a higher or broader\cb3 \ \cb1 vantage point we practice our power of discernment easing challenging thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 and emotions as we experience greater clarity and a sense of peace\cb3 \ \cb1 as you journey through this meditation keep this sense of distance in mind as\cb3 \ \cb1 thought arises and return to your breath as an anchor when needed\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 move now further into breath awareness as you practice holding your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 on this anchor that is always available to you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] notice the breaths rhythm its pace and\cb3 \ \cb1 its depth as you move alongside it in both directions hold for a brief pause\cb3 \ \cb1 just a second or two and at the end of each inhalation and each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 finding brief moments of complete stillness within each breath cycle\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] allow the mind to gently subside as you\cb3 \ \cb1 become more attuned to the present moment attachment to worried anxious or\cb3 \ \cb1 distracting thoughts can be released as you practice being the observer of\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever is moving through you just\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to sink further and further into this very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 entering naturally into a state of full-bodied ease and tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 with your eyes remaining closed tuned into the space between the\cb3 \ \cb1 eyebrows just in front of your mind's eye envision in this space of vast\cb3 \ \cb1 emptiness something like a clear night sky\cb3 \ \cb1 sink into this infinite abyss of space and silence for a few moments as you\cb3 \ \cb1 prepare to enter into a cave of complete peace and tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 as you gaze with eyes closed into the empty sky in front of you envision your\cb3 \ \cb1 view dotted with infinite sparkling stars you are in an open outdoor space\cb3 \ \cb1 surrounded by the open air lakes rivers and mountains the moon is high and full\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] tune into your breath for a few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 noticing the freshness of the air that fills you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 just follow my voice for a few breaths here as you inhale deeply breathing in a\cb3 \ \cb1 sense of being completely at ease and exhale slowly releasing any tension or\cb3 \ \cb1 stress in body or mind inhaling again\cb3 \ \cb1 visualizing yourself filling up with peace and ease and exhale fully\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing anything that no longer serves your movement towards complete\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing deeply once more filling yourself with the freedom and freshness\cb3 \ \cb1 of outdoor air and exhale completely\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing all tension to be transformed by the starlit sky\cb3 \ \cb1 returned gently to your natural breath allowing your mind to refocus on the\cb3 \ \cb1 empty space in front of your mind's eye\cb3 \ \cb1 though night has fallen upon this outdoor landscape the land is lit by\cb3 \ \cb1 stars and moonlight granting you with\cb3 \ \cb1 enough light to see the curves of the earth take a moment now to simply\cb3 \ \cb1 observe the way the rocky mountain faced peaks and Falls and the way rivers and\cb3 \ \cb1 lakes gently caress the hard surface of the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 notice how peaceful it is here beneath the night sky as you feel yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 coming into complete harmony with the natural world\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] from where you stand you see an empty cavern not too far away illuminated by\cb3 \ \cb1 the full moon above its spaciousness its\cb3 \ \cb1 emptiness cause you towards it so you\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to walk slowly and mindfully towards the sheltered space within the\cb3 \ \cb1 mountain notice the way your feet\cb3 \ \cb1 effortlessly move across the earth you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel completely at home in this natural landscape as you move towards the cave\cb3 \ \cb1 that beckons you quietly\cb3 \ \cb1 as you reach the opening to this wondrous cave your original sense that\cb3 \ \cb1 it

through the body opening\cb3 \ \cb1 the chest and expanding the belly\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you witness your body coming into stillness notice how the breath naturally slows\cb3 \ \cb1 itself\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you might even allow a deep sigh of relief to leave the body on an\cb3 \ \cb1 exhalation releasing any unnecessary tension or concern that lingers in your\cb3 \ \cb1 body [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] begin to open your senses up to the world around you beginning with your\cb3 \ \cb1 ears start to become mindful of the quiet space that is around you and of\cb3 \ \cb1 any sounds that pass through this sense of stillness when opening the ears there\cb3 \ \cb1 is no need to search for noises or to label any sounds that arise simply\cb3 \ \cb1 observe whatever is going on around you through your sense of hearing\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 become aware now of the physical space you reside in noticing the sensations of\cb3 \ \cb1 the surface beneath you of any cushions or blankets above or against you notice\cb3 \ \cb1 if there is any particular sensation of the air around you does it appear to be\cb3 \ \cb1 still or in flow is it cool warm or\cb3 \ \cb1 possibly neutral\cb3 \ \cb1 just allow your physical body and its capacity to feel the ground you deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 into this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] I invite you now to move a little\cb3 \ \cb1 further into the body following the movement of air into your lungs tune in\cb3 \ \cb1 to the sensations of it as it enters and leaves you as the belly rises and as it\cb3 \ \cb1 falls\cb3 \ \cb1 without attempting to change the breath in any way\cb3 \ \cb1 allow it to carry you further into the experience of inner stillness even\cb3 \ \cb1 amidst its constant flow\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] allow the physical body to settle\cb3 \ \cb1 reaching a point of complete ease and comfort if you feel it is necessary to\cb3 \ \cb1 adjust your position in any way just move slowly and mindfully as you come\cb3 \ \cb1 into a place of deeper comfort [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] take a moment now to observe the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 you might find that thoughts and associated feelings linger beneath the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface of an otherwise very still state\cb3 \ \cb1 if thoughts are present simply observe\cb3 \ \cb1 them from a place of compassion and non judgment just see if it's possible to\cb3 \ \cb1 observe them as an outsider without becoming consumed by the stories they\cb3 \ \cb1 tell and then return your attention to the breath [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 at any point you can use the breath as a tool to draw you back into a present\cb3 \ \cb1 state of awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 when we draw our attention to the mind during meditation we might find that\cb3 \ \cb1 enchanting visuals accompany the stories we tell the point of this meditation is\cb3 \ \cb1 not to banish or look down upon this imagery that we create unconsciously\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation is simply a call to become more conscious and mindful of what is\cb3 \ \cb1 happening inside of our heads the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 is a powerful tool that can either entrap us in imagery informed by fear or\cb3 \ \cb1 that can be used to enhance our lives and create more positive beliefs ideas\cb3 \ \cb1 and dreams take a few moments now to\cb3 \ \cb1 practice being an outside observer of thoughts and imagery that appear in the\cb3 \ \cb1 mind simply become more attuned to the way that your thoughts give life to your\cb3 \ \cb1 visions knowing that you hold the power to turn your attention away from any\cb3 \ \cb1 storyline that is guided by fear worry or anxiety\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 rather than force your thoughts to become something you might deem to be more positive take this time to let all\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts dissolve continue to focus on the breath moving through you as you\cb3 \ \cb1 sink further and further away from mentor distractions\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 with each inhalation you might envision yourself being infiltrated with\cb3 \ \cb1 lightness peace and contentment and with\cb3 \ \cb1 each outward breath you can imagine that all negative and unconstructive thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 and beliefs are being released allow\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to become completely at ease within this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take another moment to feel into your physical body knowing that you are\cb3 \ \cb1 entirely supported in this moment physically emotionally and spiritually\cb3 \ \cb1 and that even through this simple act of\cb3 \ \cb1 slowing down you are beginning to invite more positive dreams into your evening\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep from this deep sense of underlying\cb3 \ \cb1 stillness I invite you now to use the power of your mind to enter a visual\cb3 \ \cb1 place of peace beauty and serenity\cb3 \ \cb1 there are no rules as to what this place should look like so long as it brings\cb3 \ \cb1 you a sense of inner peace\cb3 \ \cb1 the place you choose might be a beach a mountain range a lake or somewhere\cb3 \ \cb1 further afield perhaps somewhere far into outer space this is your vision\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments now to settle on your preferred location allowing it to\cb3 \ \cb1 enliven itself in your mind's eye\cb3 \ \cb1 commit your awareness to building this

sound is it\cb3 \ \cb1 completely silent where you are or are there subtle noises present possibly\cb3 \ \cb1 there's a recognizable beat or rhythm in any sounds that might be growing in this\cb3 \ \cb1 space or are the sounds disorderly like the\cb3 \ \cb1 unpredictable pitter-patter of rain\cb3 \ \cb1 simply allow that whatever brings you peace to arise in this place of beauty\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 tuning in now to your sense of smell are there any recognizable aromas that\cb3 \ \cb1 are present here from the smell of salty\cb3 \ \cb1 water to fresh earth and autumn leaves

be rich divine and fulfilling nourishing your entire\cb3 \ \cb1 being\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you explore this place either walking slowly through it or from a\cb3 \ \cb1 resting position allow yourself to

help you fall into a deep and peaceful sleep over the course of this\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation you will be guided to bring your awareness to each area of the body\cb3 \ \cb1 to feel into it to tighten it and then\cb3 \ \cb1 to release it completely allowing the entire body to come to a state of total\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation so before we begin this\cb3 \ \cb1 journey just ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of if you require\cb3 \ \cb1 an alarm to be set just quietly set it now if there are blinds that need to be\cb3 \ \cb1 drawn or bright lights that can be turned off just take care of these small\cb3 \ \cb1 matters before settling into a comfortable lying down position\cb3 \ \cb1 you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 wherever you are ensure that the spine and neck are straight but relaxed and\cb3 \ \cb1 that you are supported in any way that you need take your time to adjust any\cb3 \ \cb1 cushions or blankets so that you are as comfortable as possible in this very\cb3 \ \cb1 moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 set an intention now to fully let go through both body and mind as we enter a\cb3 \ \cb1 process of complete release\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you now let's begin by becoming more mindful\cb3 \ \cb1 of this exact moment in time and space\cb3 \ \cb1 begin by drawing your awareness to your ears and to all the sounds that you may\cb3 \ \cb1 currently be infiltrating through them\cb3 \ \cb1 as you open your hearing simply observe all the sounds that come from subtle\cb3 \ \cb1 hums to more prominent noises outside [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 without judging or labeling these sounds practice remaining in a state of deep\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness as vibrations filter into your eardrums and as they disappear\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the Mayans tendencies to categorize to label and the judge to\cb3 \ \cb1 step aside as you simply witness these noises as dynamic expressions of life as\cb3 \ \cb1 simple and subtle vibrations of energy\cb3 \ \cb1 now expand your awareness of this present moment by beginning to observe\cb3 \ \cb1 the physical space you rest in notice\cb3 \ \cb1 the air that touches your skin and the material world that supports and\cb3 \ \cb1 surrounds you\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments to observe each inch of your body that is in contact with the\cb3 \ \cb1 physical world you might come to notice\cb3 \ \cb1 the temperature of your body and surfaces around you you might observe\cb3 \ \cb1 the textures of blankets and pillows that brush against your skin and you\cb3 \ \cb1 might even observe a barely describable feeling of support of safety or of\cb3 \ \cb1 heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice if the body's formation or sensory experience changes in any way as\cb3 \ \cb1 you become more mindful of this physical space you are in\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 become more mindful now of your breath quietly observing the rhythm and depth\cb3 \ \cb1 of its present form [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] to be mindful does not mean to change or\cb3 \ \cb1 to manipulate the present moment in any way that the mind deemed to make better\cb3 \ \cb1 or worthy to the contrary mindful\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness asks us to open to and to accept this moment exactly as it is so\cb3 \ \cb1 with this in mind see if you can open to your breath exactly as it is right now\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing any judgment or expectation for it to feel any differently and it\cb3 \ \cb1 presently does\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you\cb3 \ \cb1 if a natural deepening occurs allow this\cb3 \ \cb1 simply noticing it as a natural movement of energy further into your being\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to observe the breath for a few more moments feeling into the expression\cb3 \ \cb1 of each inhalation and each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the feeling of air entering through your nasal cavity filling your\cb3 \ \cb1 lungs and pressing upward against your\cb3 \ \cb1 belly\cb3 \ \cb1 and then notice the same dynamic movement in Reverse observing any\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations connected to your fall exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] just breathe here in mindful awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 for a few more silent moments [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if the mind wanders at any point during this meditation see if you can refrain\cb3 \ \cb1 from judgment as you compassionately call your attention back to the present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment it is in the mines nature to wander but\cb3 \ \cb1 with that said we can use the power of our intention to refocus our attention\cb3 \ \cb1 back on this present moment this\cb3 \ \cb1 refocusing is what helps us to enter an expanding state of complete of\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 in just a few moments we will enter into a full-body scan through which you will\cb3 \ \cb1 become deeply aware of the presence of tightness in the body and then of the\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling of complete relaxation you will\cb3 \ \cb1 be guided to witness tighten and release each area that we pass allowing each\cb3 \ \cb1 part of the body that come to deep rest and complete ease in preparation for a\cb3 \ \cb1 peaceful night's sleep [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as much as possible see if you can align tightening movements with your\cb3 \ \cb1 inhalations and all movements towards release with your exhalations\cb3 \ \cb1 just breathe naturally in between each muscle group that we work on so before\cb3 \ \cb1 we begin into this body scan I invite you to make any adjustments now that\cb3 \ \cb1 will help you to feel into the entirety of your body you might find that it is\cb3 \ \cb1 easiest to access each muscle when in a straight line down position on your back\cb3 \ \cb1 however if this is not comfortable for you come into a position that is as\cb3 \ \cb1 neutral as possible while remaining comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] ensure that the chest is open with\cb3 \ \cb1 shoulders drawing away from the ears\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your breath to continue to be in the background of your awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 secondary only to your gently shifting awareness of the physical body so begin\cb3 \ \cb1 by noticing your toes feeling into them exactly as they are in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice if there are any sensations present any tightness or softness\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and now consciously tighten just your toes on your next inhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 observing what it feels like for them to be pulled inwards completely and then\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale letting them go and allowing all tension melting away with these\cb3 \ \cb1 now bring your awareness towards both feet toes and ankles included\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] observing them exactly as they are in this moment on the next breath in tense\cb3 \ \cb1 all muscles in the feet area holding\cb3 \ \cb1 tightly for just a brief moment and then release all of the tension on your\cb3 \ \cb1 exhalation allowing your feet toes and\cb3 \ \cb1 then goes to rest back down completely and breathing normally for a few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] observe now the presence of both of your\cb3 \ \cb1 legs drawing your awareness all the way from your heels up to your hips noting\cb3 \ \cb1 any sensations you pass along the way\cb3 \ \cb1 hold the entirety of both legs in your awareness and then inhale as you tighten\cb3 \ \cb1 these muscles squeezing them in towards\cb3 \ \cb1 your midline\cb3 \ \cb1 hold there for a moment and then exhale releasing them completely into the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface beneath you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 moving to the area between the hips draw your awareness to your pelvis on your\cb3 \ \cb1 next breath in tighten all of these muscles holding them for just a brief\cb3 \ \cb1 moment and then release them completely on your next breath out just feeling to\cb3 \ \cb1 this complete release from your pelvis downward letting each of these areas\cb3 \ \cb1 sink further into the support of the physical world\cb3 \ \cb1 observe the stomach region now becoming aware of its present state\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and then as you inhale tighten all of\cb3 \ \cb1 these core muscles holding them in tightly for just a moment as you hold\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath in and then release entirely as you exhale softening all muscles\cb3 \ \cb1 around the belly return to your natural\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing rhythm as you relax the stomach completely now expand your\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness of the stomach to encompass the entire torso from lower back to\cb3 \ \cb1 upper and from belly up to the shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment now to observe each muscle group in the core of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] now on your next inhalation tighten them\cb3 \ \cb1 or towards the midline of your body feeling them in a contracted state and\cb3 \ \cb1 then release heavily with a sigh allowing your entire torso to relax\cb3 \ \cb1 completely [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment here to reconnect with your breath mindfully observing its\cb3 \ \cb1 present form\cb3 \ \cb1 bring your awareness now to your hands fingers included observe the way they\cb3 \ \cb1 are resting in this moment noticing if they are relaxed or tense or somewhere\cb3 \ \cb1 in between\cb3 \ \cb1 as you inhale allow all of these muscles in the hands and fingers to tighten\cb3 \ \cb1 coming into a compressed fist hold for a\cb3 \ \cb1 brief second or two and then exhale as you release\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing both hands to rest completely relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your awareness now from your wrists all the way up to your shoulders and\cb3 \ \cb1 compasses and areas in between so inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 as you contract all of these muscles perhaps pulling them up towards your\cb3 \ \cb1 ears and then soften releasing all of\cb3 \ \cb1 these muscles in the limbs back down shoulders falling back down gently as\cb3 \ \cb1 well notice how different it feels in\cb3 \ \cb1 both body and mind between your contracted States and your\cb3 \ \cb1 softened ones\cb3 \ \cb1 now begin to observe all of the intricate muscles in your face\cb3 \ \cb1 noticing if there are any sensations present here [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 consider the muscles in your jaw your\cb3 \ \cb1 cheeks your

muscle group accessible to your awareness squeezing the entirety\cb3 \ \cb1 of your body towards your midline hold everything together with the breath held\cb3 \ \cb1 in and then release completely letting a deep sigh escape from your lungs as all\cb3 \ \cb1 remaining tension and stress falls away\cb3 \ \cb1 allow each muscle to melt into the surface beneath you allow your breath to\cb3 \ \cb1 return to its normal rhythm as you sink further and further into the experience\cb3 \ \cb1 of this complete relaxation [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe naturally mindfully observing the flow of

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and\cb3 \ \cb1 thank you for tuning into this\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation this meditation comes at a\cb3 \ \cb1 time an exceptionally challenging time\cb3 \ \cb1 for us here in Australia as the\cb3 \ \cb1 wildfires have sparked overwhelming\cb3 \ \cb1 devastation fear uncertainty grief and\cb3 \ \cb1 despair with a situation as destructive\cb3 \ \cb1 as this one right before our very eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 it's hard to find a sense of peace\cb3 \ \cb1 safety and security in the earth beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 our feet even those who have seen the\cb3 \ \cb1 images footages and news from afar can\cb3 \ \cb1 sense a great loss that is occurring in\cb3 \ \cb1 this beautiful country\cb3 \ \cb1 humans pets plants animals property\cb3 \ \cb1 nothing is beyond the reach of these\cb3 \ \cb1 fires so wherever you are in the world\cb3 \ \cb1 I hope this meditation brings some sense\cb3 \ \cb1 of peace comfort as we move forward to\cb3 \ \cb1 get started I invite you to take a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment just to settle into this space\cb3 \ \cb1 either lying down or in a comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 seated position and allow your belly to\cb3 \ \cb1 relax and the forit to soften as you\cb3 \ \cb1 simply arrive wherever you are\cb3 \ \cb1 my hopes are that you are far from\cb3 \ \cb1 danger in this moment and then you can\cb3 \ \cb1 find some sense of solidity in the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath you right now so draw your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention to the breath and watching it\cb3 \ \cb1 as it flows into and out of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and then see if you might invite the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath a little bit deeper relaxing your\cb3 \ \cb1 stomach as you welcome both body and\cb3 \ \cb1 mind to soften here\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now take a few moments to be mindful of\cb3 \ \cb1 any thoughts or any feelings any stories\cb3 \ \cb1 that are moving through your mind in\cb3 \ \cb1 this moment if you've been touched by\cb3 \ \cb1 fires in some way in Australia or any\cb3 \ \cb1 part of the world take a moment to honor\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever feelings and sensations are\cb3 \ \cb1 present for you and if you are somewhere\cb3 \ \cb1 else across the ocean and have been\cb3 \ \cb1 shaken by what you've seen in the media\cb3 \ \cb1 or heard from loved ones take a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 to also honor whatever has arisen within\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation is not designed to make\cb3 \ \cb1 everything okay it is first meant to\cb3 \ \cb1 assist us in honoring the raw truth of\cb3 \ \cb1 our experience before guiding us into\cb3 \ \cb1 some sense of peace despite this tragic\cb3 \ \cb1 event\cb3 \ \cb1 now finish your next exhalation and then\cb3 \ \cb1 take a deep breath in and out a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 breath in once again\cb3 \ \cb1 and out\cb3 \ \cb1 and one more time\cb3 \ \cb1 while it's important to witness and\cb3 \ \cb1 honor whatever is within us we can\cb3 \ \cb1 continually bring ourselves back to the\cb3 \ \cb1 peace and safety of this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 through awareness of the breath use the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath as your anchor anytime you need\cb3 \ \cb1 to reconnect with what is right here\cb3 \ \cb1 the fear and uncertainty of approaching\cb3 \ \cb1 fires the loss of homes of wildlife and\cb3 \ \cb1 animals a sense of hopelessness\cb3 \ \cb1 helplessness and disempowerment and the\cb3 \ \cb1 grief the anger the shock the\cb3 \ \cb1 desperation all of these are very real\cb3 \ \cb1 experiences that a meditation cannot\cb3 \ \cb1 make right in any tangible sense the\cb3 \ \cb1 very raw and heart-wrenching feelings\cb3 \ \cb1 that have been stirred are so deeply\cb3 \ \cb1 human the devastation is hard to put\cb3 \ \cb1 into words\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and so because of what is happening here\cb3 \ \cb1 and in other areas of the world we might\cb3 \ \cb1 feel as if someone or something is to\cb3 \ \cb1 blame now whether that be climate change\cb3 \ \cb1 politicians or humanity as a whole being\cb3 \ \cb1 able to point out a cause for this\cb3 \ \cb1 devastation can in some way feel\cb3 \ \cb1 consoling and yet anger blame and rage\cb3 \ \cb1 will not help us to find peace healing\cb3 \ \cb1 and a way for us to move forward and\cb3 \ \cb1 when we dig deeper we might tap into\cb3 \ \cb1 what is beneath our anger is there a\cb3 \ \cb1 sense of fear\cb3 \ \cb1 juda feeling unsupported unprotected or\cb3 \ \cb1 vulnerable\cb3 \ \cb1 is there a sense of despair for the\cb3 \ \cb1 suffering of animals wildlife and\cb3 \ \cb1 humanity\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever is moving through you I invite\cb3 \ \cb1 you to tune in to what is present in the\cb3 \ \cb1 body and can you observe and sit with\cb3 \ \cb1 these emotions as they manifest\cb3 \ \cb1 themselves in your physical being\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you might want to breathe energy into\cb3 \ \cb1 these areas of tightness tension or\cb3 \ \cb1 resistance naturally letting yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 soften into this meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 grounding through the breath little\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts and stories come as they may\cb3 \ \cb1 and and watch them depart just as\cb3 \ \cb1 effortlessly with each out breath this\cb3 \ \cb1 might take some time so just practice\cb3 \ \cb1 compassion as these things work\cb3 \ \cb1 themselves through\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 to explore this soft and compassionate\cb3 \ \cb1 witnessing I invite you to create a bit\cb3 \ \cb1 of distance between your thoughts and\cb3 \ \cb1 feelings and yourself as the observer of\cb3 \ \cb1 them see if you might approach your\cb3 \ \cb1 fears and concerns from a place of your\cb3 \ \cb1 highest itself as you watch what moves\cb3 \ \cb1 through consider can i nurture this part\cb3 \ \cb1 of me this part of the world that is\cb3 \ \cb1 suffering\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 open your heart to yourself holding\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself exactly as you are in this\cb3 \ \cb1 moment and as we open up through this\cb3 \ \cb1 center of our being we can begin to find\cb3 \ \cb1 a greater sense of peace even amidst the\cb3 \ \cb1 heaviness that life can bring\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe all the way into the\cb3 \ \cb1 base of the belly and all the way back\cb3 \ \cb1 out releasing just a fraction of\cb3 \ \cb1 discomfort resistance and any strong\cb3 \ \cb1 emotions with each and every breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now begin to imagine a white healing\cb3 \ \cb1 light penetrating from the top of your\cb3 \ \cb1 head inching ever so slowly down through\cb3 \ \cb1 the body with every body part that it\cb3 \ \cb1 passes feel your body gently opening up\cb3 \ \cb1 to a deeper release in a sense of bees\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the mind to soften beneath its\cb3 \ \cb1 glow your heart to expand and your belly\cb3 \ \cb1 to relax and your limbs to find softness\cb3 \ \cb1 and stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 while there may be residue of emotion\cb3 \ \cb1 and fear see if you can open yourself up\cb3 \ \cb1 to this moment of peace stillness and\cb3 \ \cb1 subtle healing\cb3 \ \cb1 can you allow yourself to be bathed in\cb3 \ \cb1 this white healing glow but these next\cb3 \ \cb1 few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 and now from this lighter softer space\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you might open your heart as you\cb3 \ \cb1 bring to mind the land the humans and\cb3 \ \cb1 the animals that are in need of your\cb3 \ \cb1 love and your prayers at this time\cb3 \ \cb1 you might envision strangers or perhaps\cb3 \ \cb1 someone you know and love you might\cb3 \ \cb1 envision farmland forests\cb3 \ \cb1 plants and animals or rows of homes you\cb3 \ \cb1 might envision the whole country or the\cb3 \ \cb1 whole world\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 regardless of what comes to mind allow\cb3 \ \cb1 the images of these Souls to enter your\cb3 \ \cb1 mind from a place of love rather than\cb3 \ \cb1 fear hold the image of them in both mind\cb3 \ \cb1 and heart and sending love light and\cb3 \ \cb1 peace to all those affected\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as we allow our strongest emotions to\cb3 \ \cb1 come to pass and to soften opening up to\cb3 \ \cb1 our reality from a place of purpose and\cb3 \ \cb1 love we start to uncover ways we might\cb3 \ \cb1 be of benefit to ourselves to our loved\cb3 \ \cb1 ones our community and our shared\cb3 \ \cb1 humanity from sending prayers to sending\cb3 \ \cb1 support and supplies to helping in\cb3 \ \cb1 hands-on ways where possible let these\cb3 \ \cb1 devastating fires bring our shared\cb3 \ \cb1 humanity to the forefront encouraging us\cb3 \ \cb1 to love support and send peace to all\cb3 \ \cb1 those on this planet take a few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 of quiet space now to send prayers or\cb3 \ \cb1 loving thoughts to all those affected by\cb3 \ \cb1 these fires and to those affected by any\cb3 \ \cb1 other disaster that is shaking this\cb3 \ \cb1 world and those who call it home\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 gently soften your mind of all thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 or prayers and all best wishes as you\cb3 \ \cb1 come back to the natural rhythm of the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath allow each inhalation to open\cb3 \ \cb1 your heart to the love and healing that\cb3 \ \cb1 is possible and each exhalation free you\cb3 \ \cb1 of things that no longer serve you so\cb3 \ \cb1 that you may move through this world\cb3 \ \cb1 with hope and purpose and love whatever\cb3 \ \cb1 comes your way I send you my prayers and\cb3 \ \cb1 warmest of wishes allow the waves of\cb3 \ \cb1 life to move through you but to never\cb3 \ \cb1 hold you down for too long\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath the destruction and devastation\cb3 \ \cb1 there is hope for a new world of peace\cb3 \ \cb1 and love and beauty take your time to\cb3 \ \cb1 come out of this meditation trusting the\cb3 \ \cb1 process that leads you to renewed faith\cb3 \ \cb1 hope and healing and I send you many\cb3 \ \cb1 many blessings to you and your loved\cb3 \ \cb1 ones\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \ \ \ }

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this bedtime meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 designed to promote more peaceful and soothing dreams\cb3 \ \cb1 whether you have experienced difficult dreams lately or an absence of dreams\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation will help to set the stage for beautiful imagery to visit you\cb3 \ \cb1 as you sleep while listening to this meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 simply allow your body to rest and your mind to expand as you drift into\cb3 \ \cb1 beautiful places using the power of your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 so now I asked you to take a few deep breaths opening yourself to this\cb3 \ \cb1 powerful practice of visualization\cb3 \ \cb1 before we set the stage for better dreams to come to you let's take a\cb3 \ \cb1 journey into the body and mind exactly as it is now to prepare I invite you to\cb3 \ \cb1 make yourself entirely comfortable lie down in any position that is comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 to you however you rest remain mindful of keeping the neck in line with the\cb3 \ \cb1 spine to help promote a sense of openness and relaxation within the body\cb3 \ \cb1 proper posture even when sleeping helps to promote positive feelings that will\cb3 \ \cb1 carry over into sleep making any final\cb3 \ \cb1 adjustments necessary just allow yourself to come into a state of\cb3 \ \cb1 complete stillness the only observable\cb3 \ \cb1 movement now should be the breath as it makes its way through the body opening\cb3 \ \cb1 the chest and expanding the belly\cb3 \ \cb1 as you witness your body coming into stillness notice how the breath naturally slows\cb3 \ \cb1 itself\cb3 \ \cb1 you might even allow a deep sigh of relief to leave the body on an\cb3 \ \cb1 exhalation releasing any unnecessary tension or concern that lingers in your\cb3 \ \cb1 body\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to open your senses up to the world around you beginning with your\cb3 \ \cb1 ears start to become mindful of the quiet space that is around you and of\cb3 \ \cb1 any sounds that pass through this sense of stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 when opening the ears there is no need to search for noises or to label any\cb3 \ \cb1 sounds that arise simply observe whatever is going on around you through\cb3 \ \cb1 your sense of hearing [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 become aware now of the physical space you reside in noticing the sensations of\cb3 \ \cb1 the surface beneath you of any cushions or blankets above or against you notice\cb3 \ \cb1 if there is any particular sensation of the air around you does it appear to be\cb3 \ \cb1 still or in flow is it cool warm or\cb3 \ \cb1 possibly neutral [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 just allow your physical body and its capacity to feel the ground you deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 into this present moment [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I invite you now to move a little further into the body following the\cb3 \ \cb1 movement of air into your lungs tune in\cb3 \ \cb1 to the sensations of it as it enters and leaves you as the belly rises and as it\cb3 \ \cb1 falls [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 without attempting to change the breath in any way allow it to carry you further\cb3 \ \cb1 into the experience of inner stillness even amidst its constant flow\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the physical body to settle reaching a point of complete ease and\cb3 \ \cb1 comfort if you feel is necessary to\cb3 \ \cb1 adjust your position in any way just move slowly and mindfully as you come\cb3 \ \cb1 into a place of deeper comfort [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment now to observe the mind you might find that thoughts and\cb3 \ \cb1 associated feelings linger beneath the surface of an otherwise very still state\cb3 \ \cb1 if thoughts are present simply observe\cb3 \ \cb1 them from a place of compassion and non judgment just see if it's possible to\cb3 \ \cb1 observe them as an outsider without becoming consumed by the stories they\cb3 \ \cb1 tell and then return your attention to the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] at any point you can use the breath as a\cb3 \ \cb1 tool to draw you back into a present state of awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 when we draw our attention to the mind during meditation we might find that\cb3 \ \cb1 enchanting visuals accompany the stories we tell the point of this meditation is\cb3 \ \cb1 not to banish or look down upon this imagery that we create unconsciously\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation is simply a call to become more conscious and mindful of what is\cb3 \ \cb1 happening inside of our heads the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 is a powerful tool that can either entrap us in imagery informed by fear or\cb3 \ \cb1 that can be used to enhance our lives and create more positive beliefs ideas\cb3 \ \cb1 and dreams take a few moments now to\cb3 \ \cb1 practice being an outside observer of thoughts and imagery that appear in the\cb3 \ \cb1 mind simply become more attuned to the way that your thoughts give life to your\cb3 \ \cb1 visions knowing that you hold the power to turn your attention away from any\cb3 \ \cb1 storyline that is guided by fear worry or anxiety\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 rather than force your thoughts to become something you might deem to be more positive take this time to let all\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts dissolve continue to focus on the breath moving through you as you\cb3 \ \cb1 sink further and further away from mental distractions\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 with each inhalation you might envision yourself being infiltrated with\cb3 \ \cb1 lightness peace and contentment and with\cb3 \ \cb1 each outward breath you can imagine that all negative and unconstructive thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 and beliefs are being released allow\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to become completely at ease within this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 take another moment to feel into your physical body knowing that you are\cb3 \ \cb1 entirely supported in this moment physically emotionally and spiritually\cb3 \ \cb1 and that even through this simple act of slowing down you are beginning to invite\cb3 \ \cb1 more positive dreams into your evening sleep [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 from this deep sense of underlying stillness I invite you now to use the\cb3 \ \cb1 power of your mind to enter a visual place of peace beauty and serenity there\cb3 \ \cb1 are no rules as to what this place should look like so long as it brings\cb3 \ \cb1 you a sense of inner peace the place you\cb3 \ \cb1 choose might be a beach a mountain range a lake or somewhere further afield\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps somewhere far into outer space this is your vision take a few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 now to settle on your preferred location allowing it to enliven itself in your\cb3 \ \cb1 mind's eye [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 commit your awareness to building this peaceful space in your mind allow it to\cb3 \ \cb1 expand naturally alongside your growing sense of inner tranquility build it\cb3 \ \cb1 using the blessing of all of your five senses tune into your sense of sight\cb3 \ \cb1 first

if any or all\cb3 \ \cb1 of these are present\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your creation of this space to include your sense of sound is it\cb3 \ \cb1 completely silent where you are or are there subtle noises present possibly\cb3 \ \cb1 there's a recognizable beat or rhythm in any sounds that might be growing in this\cb3 \ \cb1 space or are the sounds disorderly like\cb3 \ \cb1 the unpredictable pitter-patter of rain [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 simply allow that whatever brings you peace to arise in this place of beauty\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 tuning in now to your sense of

imagery you are resting within and if nothing arises that is fine too there\cb3 \ \cb1 are no rules to what your mind creates so long as it brings you comfort\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 consider your sense of taste now allowing your experience here to delight\cb3 \ \cb1 your taste buds as you explore this\cb3 \ \cb1 peaceful landscape is there anything that you feel compelled to taste you\cb3

expectations\cb3 \ \cb1 of pain you may resist pain because you don't like to be\cb3 \ \cb1 uncomfortable as this is human nature this causes the pain to be pushed down\cb3 \ \cb1 and not processed and then released this resistance to the sensations in\cb3 \ \cb1 your body and the negative associations with these feelings\cb3 \ \cb1 can cause additional suffering while this meditation practice is not a\cb3 \ \cb1 substitute for medical treatment if needed it can help to ease the suffering and\cb3 \ \cb1 help you find the positive to connect with\cb3 \ \cb1 i'm sarah raymond from the mindful

close your eyes when you are ready\cb3 \ \cb1 to bring your attention to your inner\cb3 \ \cb1 self\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few breaths in through your nose\cb3 \ \cb1 and out through your mouth like a sigh to send a signal to your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 and body that it is time to shift into rest\cb3 \ \cb1 this is a message that you are safe and supported\cb3 \ \cb1 to relax and let go of any pain\cb3 \ \cb1 feel the shift beginning to happen for you notice\cb3 \ \cb1 the power of your breath in this journey of relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 as the sense of ease in your body continues to expand\cb3 \ \cb1 become aware of your internal energy\cb3 \ \cb1 without making any changes simply notice how you are beginning this\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation practice\cb3 \ \cb1 what is showing up for you right now\cb3 \ \cb1 notice without judgment\cb3 \ \cb1 and without expectations\cb3 \ \cb1 the physical sensations you experience are your body's way to give you\cb3 \ \cb1 a message\cb3 \ \cb1 it is your body's way to ask you to pay attention to what is most needed\cb3 \ \cb1 if those signals are ignored or suppressed they will continue\cb3 \ \cb1 showing up and eventually they will become more obvious\cb3 \ \cb1 and impossible to ignore\cb3 \ \cb1 recognize what you are feeling in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 as you acknowledge your experience allow it to be just as it is\cb3 \ \cb1 with acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 this is not to say you are giving up you are simply not adding more suffering\cb3 \ \cb1 by resisting reality\cb3 \ \cb1 invite ease into the areas that may be asking for your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 approach this practice with acceptance as you give yourself permission\cb3 \ \cb1 to have whatever your experience is\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of resistance\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of judgment\cb3 \ \cb1 practice surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 now begin to move your attention slowly over your physical sensations\cb3 \ \cb1 begin at the top of your head and scan your body's sensations\cb3 \ \cb1 from the inside with a flowing attention\cb3 \ \cb1 all the way down to the soles of your feet\cb3 \ \cb1 as your attention flows from one part of your body to another\cb3 \ \cb1 pause and linger on any areas that seem to be\cb3 \ \cb1 asking for your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 give each of these sensations the notice that it is needing\cb3 \ \cb1 your physical body is your anchor or your reminder for this meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 so if you find that your mind has wandered off into a story or thoughts about\cb3 \ \cb1 something else lovingly bring it back to the current\cb3 \ \cb1 experience of your sensations\cb3 \ \cb1 notice any areas of your body where you are experiencing feelings\cb3 \ \cb1 and simply be with the sensations without labeling good or bad\cb3 \ \cb1 or telling a story of why these sensations are here\cb3 \ \cb1 stay with the felt sense of the sensation\cb3 \ \cb1 and let go of your ideas about it\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome anything and everything you are feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 be with the actual experience of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 and let go of your resistance to this experience\cb3 \ \cb1 what would it be like for you to encourage a release\cb3 \ \cb1 a letting go of any tension as you move your awareness around\cb3 \ \cb1 your body\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of your attention and attachment to what isn't working for\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of what is no longer serving you\cb3 \ \cb1 this tension may have been there to serve you at one point\cb3 \ \cb1 but now you can let it go\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps it resonates with you to visualize a letting go\cb3 \ \cb1 you may see a beautiful bird fly off into the sky\cb3 \ \cb1 or a feather being carried by a light breeze\cb3 \ \cb1 or any other visualization of letting go\cb3 \ \cb1 that shows up in your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 once your awareness reaches your feet bring it back to the top of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 and begin again\cb3 \ \cb1 this time as your attention flows through your body\cb3 \ \cb1 focus on any areas of ease and softness within your body\cb3 \ \cb1 sense the quality of this area even if it is the smallest area\cb3 \ \cb1 fully experience an area of your body where you are feeling ease\cb3 \ \cb1 sense all there is to notice about this ease within you\cb3 \ \cb1 know that it is available to you\cb3 \ \cb1 invite these areas of ease to\cb3 \ \cb1 spread know that what you focus on expands\cb3 \ \cb1 so welcome your sense of peace to move and grow\cb3 \ \cb1 expanding outward\cb3 \ \cb1 connect with what is good and allow the good to radiate outward\cb3 \ \cb1 just like the rays of sun expanding outward in all directions\cb3 \ \cb1 what would it be like for you to experience a feeling of love and kindness\cb3 \ \cb1 for your body right now\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe this in\cb3 \ \cb1 stay with the

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this soothing guided\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation that will take you on a journey into the peace of the ocean\cb3 \ \cb1 gently guiding you towards a restorative and peaceful sleep during the course of\cb3 \ \cb1 this journey you will first come into contact with the peace that exists right\cb3 \ \cb1 here in the present moment before being guided to open yourself up to a deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 descent underwater all that is required\cb3 \ \cb1 of you now is a willingness to open yourself up to the possibility of\cb3 \ \cb1 complete inner harmony take a few grounding breaths now as we\cb3 \ \cb1 begin this exploration allowing your heart and chest to soften with each\cb3 \ \cb1 breath that you take [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now take a few moments to make any necessary adjustments to the physical\cb3 \ \cb1 body moving yourself in such a way to allow relaxation to flow effortlessly\cb3 \ \cb1 through your being if there is any tightness lingering around the chest or\cb3 \ \cb1 the stomach or your shoulders or any\cb3 \ \cb1 other part of your body quietly make note of this tension and then gently\cb3 \ \cb1 release it on the next breath out [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 straighten your neck soften the area around your eyes as you consciously\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to release all physical tension you prepare yourself for the journey\cb3 \ \cb1 into deep release and peace\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] now before we journey anywhere let's\cb3 \ \cb1 take some time to become more intimately aware of the environment around and within us begin by simply drawing your\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness to the physical body and each area of it that is in contact with the\cb3 \ \cb1 physical support beneath you you might notice the entire back side of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 being completely supported by the bed or the cushions or the blankets underneath\cb3 \ \cb1 you just take a moment to simply draw your attention to each area of contact\cb3 \ \cb1 here\cb3 \ \cb1 now consider areas of the body facing upwards towards the ceiling that are\cb3 \ \cb1 also in contact with the material world noticing items of comfort that might be\cb3 \ \cb1 draped over the top of you and then see\cb3 \ \cb1 if you can finally tuned in to the invisibility of air that surrounds your\cb3 \ \cb1 body noticing if you can feel it against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 in these observations there is no need to search for some specific form of\cb3 \ \cb1 experience or result simply allow any arisings to be witnessed\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your attention now to the belly as you observe the way it rises and falls\cb3 \ \cb1 as you inhale and exhale [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 even if sensations of the breath within a more subtle we can typically observe\cb3 \ \cb1 their presence in the form of movement once we draw our attention to this life\cb3 \ \cb1 force so allow the rest of the body to remain still as you focus for a few\cb3 \ \cb1 silent moments on the rising and falling of your core\cb3 \ \cb1 use your breath as an anchor when needed throughout this meditation even when you\cb3 \ \cb1 descend into the depths of the ocean in this visualization the breath is always\cb3 \ \cb1 available to provide you with grounding support and connection to this physical\cb3 \ \cb1 existence and if at any point the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 wanders becoming preoccupied with stories fears or judgments or chatter of\cb3 \ \cb1 any sort you can once again turn to the breath or to my words to refocus your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention it's entirely natural for our minds to wander so there is no need to\cb3 \ \cb1 condemn this tendency in any way when distractions occur simply take a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 breath refocus your attention and settle\cb3 \ \cb1 into this act of self-care once again\cb3 \ \cb1 as you watched the breath moving into and out of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 allow a sense of tranquility to overcome your entire being of seemingly\cb3 \ \cb1 paradoxical the breath is both like an anchor and like the waves they are one\cb3 \ \cb1 in the same as we learn to ride the waves of breath and of life we move\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the discovery of complete presence and stillness no matter how\cb3 \ \cb1 still we bring ourselves to be waves will still come just as the breath will\cb3 \ \cb1 still come movement is a part of life how we react to those movements is where\cb3 \ \cb1 we discover our power to maneuver ourselves in this world peacefully and\cb3 \ \cb1 calmly so before we descend into the\cb3 \ \cb1 ocean take a few moments of silence to effortlessly move with the rhythm of\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath the body will remain still while the present moment continually\cb3 \ \cb1 shifts sink into this peaceful movement for a\cb3 \ \cb1 short while now\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take this moment to tune into the space between the brows into the Mayans I\cb3 \ \cb1 allow all thoughts and images to melt away as you focus your attention solely\cb3 \ \cb1 on the empty space before you the world around and within becomes quiet as you\cb3 \ \cb1 prepare for a journey into the depths of the ocean upon this blank slate before\cb3 \ \cb1 your mind's eye begin to visualize yourself at the edge of the ocean your\cb3 \ \cb1 bare feet are nestled into the sand as you stare out the vast sea before you\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments to observe the sensations present what do your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 notice\cb3 \ \cb1 you what sounds to your ears pickup\cb3 \ \cb1 what smells fill the air\cb3 \ \cb1 how does your body feel how does your heart feel\cb3 \ \cb1 as you begin to relax into this space eel the ocean air filling the entire\cb3 \ \cb1 cavity of your lungs as you inhale and then releasing all unnecessary stress\cb3 \ \cb1 and tension from your physical body as you exhale stare out at the open sea as\cb3 \ \cb1 you witness every knot and contraction dissolving\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a few steps forward so that as the waves brush up against the shore\cb3 \ \cb1 they cover your feet observe the natural\cb3 \ \cb1 rhythm of the waves steady though ever-changing just like the breath they\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to flow in and out in\cb3 \ \cb1 and out\cb3 \ \cb1 the ocean slowly becomes influenced by your breaths natural rhythm slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 coming to meet your own unique flow you\cb3 \ \cb1 start to feel yourself to be in total harmony with the vast abyss in front of\cb3 \ \cb1 you something inside of you whispers\cb3 \ \cb1 view to venture into the water so you start to move slowly and gracefully\cb3 \ \cb1 forward step by step you wade out until\cb3 \ \cb1 soon your calves are submerged and then your knees\cb3 \ \cb1 your thighs and your waist you stand\cb3 \ \cb1 waist-deep as you prepare to dive below\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] stretching your arms out before you you take a deep breath a small jump and then\cb3 \ \cb1 dive forward with grace and these you are now completely submerged as you\cb3 \ \cb1 glide through the water extending both arm fords and then swooping them out to\cb3 \ \cb1 the sides to propel you further you notice that by divine magic you are able\cb3 \ \cb1 to breathe beneath the water small gills have developed and you come to realize\cb3 \ \cb1 that you are neither of this world nor the human one you are otherworldly a\cb3 \ \cb1 great wave of relief washes over you as you realize you had been yearning to\cb3 \ \cb1 explore this underwater palace with ease\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue to breast to stroke your way through the ocean feeling completely\cb3 \ \cb1 safe and accepted within this new kingdom [Music] you absorb every new side every color\cb3 \ \cb1 texture and shape of the sea life you pass\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] seahorses brightly striped fish and even\cb3 \ \cb1 small shark swim around you none of them posing any threat to you in this magical\cb3 \ \cb1 environment you breathe naturally and\cb3 \ \cb1 effortlessly underwater your body feels light and free completely supported with\cb3 \ \cb1 each and every movement you make with\cb3 \ \cb1 every drop of water that soon passes over your body old stories and\cb3 \ \cb1 detachments are released soon nothing\cb3 \ \cb1 remains but a sense of oneness you are aligned with the oceans movements\cb3 \ \cb1 gliding with grace\cb3 \ \cb1 now something appears to be approaching you from straight ahead though you\cb3 \ \cb1 cannot make out what the creature is your intuition tells you it is not\cb3 \ \cb1 threatening the pair of eyes move closer and closer until very soon you know the\cb3 \ \cb1 figure to be a dolphin that is making its way toward you the dolphin slows as\cb3 \ \cb1 she approaches stilling herself just a few feet ahead of you\cb3 \ \cb1 you too have ceased movement now floating effortlessly in the open abyss\cb3 \ \cb1 of the great sea both pairs of eyes meet\cb3 \ \cb1 as you take a few silent moments of pure awareness here you can sense that your\cb3 \ \cb1 energies are in harmony and that you have attracted one another for a reason\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 though the dolphin speaks a different language in sound the vibrations relay\cb3 \ \cb1 her message she reminds you that it is possible to be both compassionate and\cb3 \ \cb1 gentle while harnessing a deep and authentic source of inner strength when\cb3 \ \cb1 embodying these two principles the way dolphins do body and mind relax\cb3 \ \cb1 completely knowing that the paradoxes in life do not have to bring strife\cb3 \ \cb1 strength and compassion can co-exist they can be one in the same\cb3 \ \cb1 the dolphin breaks her gaze as she swims off to the side and begins to swim\cb3 \ \cb1 playful circles around you she sings out to the sea reminding you\cb3 \ \cb1 that it is okay to lighten up to play and to be who you really are as she\cb3 \ \cb1 sings you feel her vibrations radiating into the core of your being in this\cb3 \ \cb1 moment you know you are forever changed for the better balance and harmony have\cb3 \ \cb1 now made their way into your burns rather than remaining an idea digested\cb3 \ \cb1 by mind alone [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the dolphin slows and comes back for one more brief moment to gaze into your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 a subtle smile overcomes her face before\cb3 \ \cb1 she flutters away disappearing into the darkness ahead of you you breathe deeply\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling her still very much present within you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 she has blessed you with a wisdom and the gifts gifts that now live within you\cb3 \ \cb1 you look above and notice you are not too far from the surface of the ocean\cb3 \ \cb1 the sunlight trickles in to remind you to come back to the human world though\cb3 \ \cb1 you have enjoyed your time in the depths of the ocean you know you must now\cb3 \ \cb1 return as you swim slowly and calmly up towards\cb3 \ \cb1 the light you feel every last grain of tension fall from your body sinking down\cb3 \ \cb1 to the ocean floor to be renewed you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel light and free having no remaining weightiness in your body or mind as you\cb3 \ \cb1 break through the barrier of water that opens up to the open sky your gills\cb3 \ \cb1 disappear and you notice what it is like to breathe like a human once again\cb3 \ \cb1 floating on your back you take a few deep breaths into the belly feeling a\cb3 \ \cb1 sense of calm filling you completely [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 visuals of the ocean begin to disappear from your mind's eye as you tune in once\cb3 \ \cb1 again to the support and strength of the physical world beneath your body though\cb3 \ \cb1 the ocean and a dolphin are now behind you they are forever within your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 and spirit allow this earthly world to\cb3 \ \cb1 support you once again the feeling of peace freedom and calmness that the\cb3 \ \cb1 underwater world blessed you are still within you you will carry them into\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep as you surrender effortlessly into the coming slumber\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] follow your breath acknowledging it to\cb3 \ \cb1 be both wave and anchor as you melt into\cb3 \ \cb1 this present moment completely welcoming another restorative night's sleep there\cb3 \ \cb1 is nothing left to do but to grant your body in mind permission to release\cb3 \ \cb1 themselves for another night follow your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath now in silence allowing it to guide you into a deep and peaceful sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome to this guided meditation which is designed to help you slow your racing\cb3 \ \cb1 mind and then lead you gently into a soothing and restorative sleep over the\cb3 \ \cb1 next little while I invite you to simply follow my voice as you come to\cb3 \ \cb1 experience a profound sense of silence within take a few deep breaths now to\cb3 \ \cb1 settle yourself into this space and soon and we will begin\cb3 \ \cb1 it is not uncommon within our fast-paced modern lifestyle for the mine to be on\cb3 \ \cb1 constant overdrive even when we bring\cb3 \ \cb1 the body to rest mental chatter often persists one of the primary reasons that\cb3 \ \cb1 we have trouble easing our way into sleep is because of this feverish side\cb3 \ \cb1 of the mind whether it is caught up in the past events or is living 20 steps\cb3 \ \cb1 into the future the mind has a way of pulling us out of the present moment it\cb3 \ \cb1 keeps us stimulated and engaged even when we want to try to slow down when\cb3 \ \cb1 the mind is constantly on the go deep rest is put on hold\cb3 \ \cb1 before we begin navigating this side of the mind exposing it in such a way that\cb3 \ \cb1 calms and soothes it let us take a few moments to come into a comfortable lying\cb3 \ \cb1 down position and just taking your time to stretch and release the body in any\cb3 \ \cb1 way that feels restorative and to adjust your positioning with cushions or\cb3 \ \cb1 blankets as you require and once you are\cb3 \ \cb1 settled see if it is possible to straighten the neck if it is curved at\cb3 \ \cb1 all bringing a gentle oneness across the chest breathing in and exhaling\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] grounding yourself into the physical space beneath and around you so take\cb3 \ \cb1 some time now to really connect with your breath becoming intimate with the\cb3 \ \cb1 way it passes through you as you inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 observe every sensation as the air trickles in first entering your nasal\cb3 \ \cb1 cavity passing through the trachea and then settling into the depths of your\cb3 \ \cb1 lungs and as you breathe out observe the\cb3 \ \cb1 moment in Reverse as your breath returns to the world around you notice your\cb3 \ \cb1 breaths rhythm and depth [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 without changing it in any way for the time being simply observe its flow\cb3 \ \cb1 noticing where it extends to and how fast or slow it moves as we move through\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation remember that your breath is always available to help\cb3 \ \cb1 anchor you in this present moment if distracting thoughts arise which they\cb3 \ \cb1 will allow the breath to guide you back down to your body to your direct\cb3 \ \cb1 experience of the now [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment now to simply draw your attention to your stomach notice the way\cb3 \ \cb1 the belly moves as you breathe rising\cb3 \ \cb1 and falling throughout the cycle of your breath as you draw your attention to\cb3 \ \cb1 this area of the body you might notice that the breath naturally deepens\cb3 \ \cb1 if so open yourself to this consciously\cb3 \ \cb1 release any constriction in the abdomen to help guide the flow of air deep into\cb3 \ \cb1 the belly [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 when how Mayans run uncontrollably our bodies assume a state of stress engaging\cb3 \ \cb1 a defense mechanism known as the fight-or-flight response when the body\cb3 \ \cb1 is engaged in this way the breath loses its depth hovering in the more shallow\cb3 \ \cb1 cavities of the lungs hormone surge as\cb3 \ \cb1 the body prepares to defend itself in\cb3 \ \cb1 order to counterbalance this surge of stress hormones and to soften the\cb3 \ \cb1 reaction within the body we can engage in what is known as the relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 response to help the body and mind to slow down by consciously drawing the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath into the belly we invite this counter response to take over easing the\cb3 \ \cb1 racing thoughts that stimulate the physical body\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments of silence now to deepen the breath in this way guiding it\cb3 \ \cb1 into the fullest capacity of the lungs so that it presses into the abdomen if\cb3 \ \cb1 you find it challenging at first to deepen your breath all the way this is\cb3 \ \cb1 entirely okay over time the breath will soften and the\cb3 \ \cb1 lungs will expand for now just see how\cb3 \ \cb1 far the breath is capable of going as you slowly breathe in and slowly breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 out [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts may continue to rise from time to time but there is no need to panic or\cb3 \ \cb1 self judge if they do the mind may attempt to add fuel to the fire by\cb3 \ \cb1 criticizing telling the self that it should not be thinking refrain from\cb3 \ \cb1 giving in to this common reaction reminding yourself that is natural for\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts to arise and then compassionately releasing whatever has\cb3 \ \cb1 come up\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] thinking is a natural function of the mind and as such it cannot be forced to\cb3 \ \cb1 cease entirely however we can begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 expose our racing thoughts by observing them from a new place and with the fresh\cb3 \ \cb1 lens as we uncover their nature we begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to distance ourselves from them and from the stories that they spin so now I\cb3 \ \cb1 invite you to open your heart to the truth that you are not your thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few breaths here on your own repeating the following words in silence\cb3 \ \cb1 I am NOT my thoughts I am NOT my\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts allow yourself to open\cb3 \ \cb1 wholeheartedly to the truth that your thoughts do not define you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the way that the mind can be redirected in such a way flowing\cb3 \ \cb1 alongside your attention it can take\cb3 \ \cb1 time to catch the mind when it escapes but we continued practice it is possible\cb3 \ \cb1 to refocus again and again on the direct\cb3 \ \cb1 experience within this present moment any time the mind wanders simply\cb3 \ \cb1 acknowledge its movement with compassion and curiosity there is no reason to\cb3 \ \cb1 criticize or condemn the uprising of thought instead practice observing the\cb3 \ \cb1 inner dialog from a distance when you\cb3 \ \cb1 notice yourself becoming entangled in the minds story simply notice what has\cb3 \ \cb1 happened and draw your attention back to your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] continue to follow each inhale and each\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale as you continually re-establish\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself in the present moment [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] it is possible to further de-escalate\cb3 \ \cb1 the power of your thoughts by beginning to label them whenever they arise this\cb3 \ \cb1 sort of labeling should not be based in judgment such as being defined by words\cb3 \ \cb1 such as good or bad or spiritual or an spiritual rather rising thoughts can be\cb3 \ \cb1 observed according to the action that they represent for instance you may\cb3 \ \cb1 assign certain words to your thoughts such as thinking planning denying\cb3 \ \cb1 criticizing or worrying after you label\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts in this way allow the wave to disappear and then return to your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 practice this again rooting yourself through the breath and becoming more\cb3 \ \cb1 aware of the nature of your thoughts not of their content witness the way they\cb3 \ \cb1 move and the nature of these movements\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 other actions you might notice include hoping feeling dreaming and arguing\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to quietly observe whatever arises coming back to your breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 between rising thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 you might also observe physical sensations labeling them as pressure\cb3 \ \cb1 softness tingling or warmth continue to\cb3 \ \cb1 notice whatever you notice allowing single words to disengage and trancing\cb3 \ \cb1 stories\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] continue to come back to the natural\cb3 \ \cb1 rhythm of your breath in between observations breathing in breathing out\cb3 \ \cb1 continually refocusing your attention on this innate flow\cb3 \ \cb1 now let whole words and thoughts subside as you come deeper into the physical\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations of the body take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 scan the body gently drawing your awareness first your toes before very\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly moving upwards throughout the visceral body and as you pass each area\cb3 \ \cb1 allow that part of the body to soften by\cb3 \ \cb1 simply focusing on a particular area and by using the power of your attention to\cb3 \ \cb1 release all of the associated muscles the physical body relaxes and the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxes even further alongside it\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] continue to work your way up slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing or constriction and tension that is held within the body breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 into each body part blessing your physical being with love and compassion\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] when you reach the head area pay special\cb3 \ \cb1 attention to the jaw to the eyebrows and\cb3 \ \cb1 to the forehead allow each of these muscle groups to\cb3 \ \cb1 relax observing the difference between felt contraction and release\cb3 \ \cb1 now draw your attention now to the space between your brows to what is often\cb3 \ \cb1 referred to as the third eye area and as\cb3 \ \cb1 you hold your attention on this spot consciously keep the muscles around it\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxed and breathe into this space for\cb3 \ \cb1 just a few breaths noticing any sensations or visuals that might be\cb3 \ \cb1 present\cb3 \ \cb1 now gently envision a light blue glow\cb3 \ \cb1 beginning to appear in this space it is soft and soothing gently pulsating in\cb3 \ \cb1 this space between your eyebrows and as it expands it touches every cell\cb3 \ \cb1 of the mind space dissolving all thoughts as it pulses\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you might notice yourself beginning to feel quiet tired finally feeling free of\cb3 \ \cb1 your thought waves and feeling ready to relax deeply you might also like to feel\cb3 \ \cb1 into this release through a deep sigh exhaling all tension out of the body\cb3 \ \cb1 until nothing remains in your attention aside from this healing blue light\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] once all thoughts have been dissolved\cb3 \ \cb1 this orb of energy begins to shrink but\cb3 \ \cb1 not disappearing entirely now this soft\cb3 \ \cb1 blue glow appears as a pearl pristine clear and sparkling it hovers in the\cb3 \ \cb1 space between the brows for another moment and you come to witness a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 and profound silence within its presence\cb3 \ \cb1 sit with this silence for a few moments observing the peace and tranquility this\cb3 \ \cb1 pearl of light has brought to your inner being\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the soft Paul begins to descend moving\cb3 \ \cb1 very slowly until it reaches the throat and then\cb3 \ \cb1 floating a little further still until it lands in the heart it pauses here\cb3 \ \cb1 bringing its energy of stillness and tranquility to the heart space all is\cb3 \ \cb1 silent now or has been brought to peace [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the work of this blue light is now\cb3 \ \cb1 complete and so very slowly it dissipates into nothingness you feel\cb3 \ \cb1 complete serenity in this very moment knowing that you have been freed of all\cb3 \ \cb1 racing thoughts the mind is at peace the\cb3 \ \cb1 heart is at peace and your body is at\cb3 \ \cb1 peace [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe as you begin your final descent into sleep allow the\cb3 \ \cb1 natural rhythm of your breath the slow and steady waves of each cycle to gently\cb3 \ \cb1 guide you into restorative slumber the\cb3 \ \cb1 world within you and around you is quiet\cb3 \ \cb1 any subtle sounds begin to fade away as\cb3 \ \cb1 you slowly transition into a deep and peaceful sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale and exhale slowly deeply until\cb3 \ \cb1 very soon this waking day has faded away\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome to this guided

making contact with the future that is continually unfolding if you find any\cb3 \ \cb1 anxious or fearful thoughts arise just\cb3 \ \cb1 witness them without becoming attached to them and gently focus back into your\cb3 \ \cb1 heart space or into the golden light radiating from this space within you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] focusing now on your highest potential and visions for the day it might be\cb3 \ \cb1 goals that you want to achieve things that you want to set out to do all you\cb3 \ \cb1 need to do and allow any cluttering or limiting thoughts to naturally fall away\cb3 \ \cb1 and there is no need to force anything out of existence or to judge or condemn\cb3 \ \cb1 anything that might be arising if\cb3 \ \cb1 anything less than your highest potential arises simply notice it\cb3 \ \cb1 acknowledge it and allow it to dissipate\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever we envision on a regular basis we start to manifest in the outer world\cb3 \ \cb1 consciously reflect for a moment on whatever it is your highest self wishes\cb3 \ \cb1 to manifest in your life or more specifically in the day ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 what is the deepest yearning of your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] what is the energy you wish to carry\cb3 \ \cb1 with you throughout your day\cb3 \ \cb1 continuing to feel into the hearts glow and compassionately allowing conflicting\cb3 \ \cb1 mental chatter to subside as a higher truth reveals itself begin to narrow in\cb3 \ \cb1 on what is it you wish to manifest considering for a moment that you\cb3 \ \cb1 already hold whatever it is you may take\cb3 \ \cb1 a few moments to breathe into this feeling as if it is already present\cb3 \ \cb1 within you allow your thoughts to be\cb3 \ \cb1 clear and conscious stemming from the core of who you are you might like to\cb3 \ \cb1 consider in the words of Rumi what you seek is seeking you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] just allow the openness of your heart to\cb3 \ \cb1 hold the truth that whatever you hope to embody is already here it is already\cb3 \ \cb1 present within you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 just coming back to the body now and taking in a few more grounding breaths\cb3 \ \cb1 before setting a powerful intention for the day ahead allow yourself to be\cb3 \ \cb1 completely here knowing that in truth\cb3 \ \cb1 there is no where you need to go and nothing you need to achieve as we\cb3 \ \cb1 increase our ability to be fully present you might find limiting thoughts begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to fall away and you begin to embody more deeply the truth of who you are\cb3 \ \cb1 take three silent and steady breaths here routing yourself in the expanding energy\cb3 \ \cb1 of this morning\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 so from this place of pure presence I\cb3 \ \cb1 invite you now to set one more clear and powerful intention for your day consider\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever it is you wish to embody and state it to yourself as if it were\cb3 \ \cb1 already here for instance if you are\cb3 \ \cb1 longing is for self confidence and esteem consider a phrase such as I am\cb3 \ \cb1 confident and complete or if the\cb3 \ \cb1 stability and safety are of your highest concern perhaps an affirmation like all\cb3 \ \cb1 of my deepest needs are being met\cb3 \ \cb1 just allow yourself to become very clear and focused on your intention as you\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to repeat it to yourself with each full breath so take a few moments of\cb3 \ \cb1 silence here as you align your intention with your breath letting the words fill you up entirely\cb3 \ \cb1 again and again but just a few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 so wherever you are now resting come to notice once again with eyes closed\cb3 \ \cb1 environment around you feel into the physical support of the ground beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 you of the material world it has been\cb3 \ \cb1 manifested around you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can notice the air of the room that you are currently in and he\cb3 \ \cb1 sounds near or far [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and take three more full breaths here knowing that you are unconditionally\cb3 \ \cb1 supported in this journey gently begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to soften the area around the eyes and\cb3 \ \cb1 when you are ready slowly open them up to the world around you noticing the\cb3 \ \cb1 delicate transition from dark to light as you move forward in outward action\cb3 \ \cb1 continually come back to the intention you are carrying within you knowing that\cb3 \ \cb1 the universe is here to support guide and nourish you with every step that you\cb3 \ \cb1 take [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome to this guided

body visualizations this\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation will create an inner experience of relaxation as well as\cb3 \ \cb1 guide the heart towards a healthy smooth and steady rhythm over the next short\cb3 \ \cb1 while allow my voice to guide you into this deep state of relaxation knowing\cb3 \ \cb1 that the hearts flow will follow suit as you sing further into stillness take\cb3 \ \cb1 some time now to settle into a comfortable lying down position using\cb3 \ \cb1 any blankets and cushions to support your body where needed\cb3 \ \cb1 if possible on the spine and neck should be in line to help open the flow of\cb3 \ \cb1 energy through the entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 tune into your entire body now as you make any final adjustments that will\cb3 \ \cb1 support your progression into a deeply relaxed and peaceful state I invite you\cb3 \ \cb1 now to simply bring your attention to your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 without trying to shift it in any way just gently open your awareness to it\cb3 \ \cb1 observing its natural flow rhythm and depth\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] notice the way the breath comes and goes on its own accord guided by an innate\cb3 \ \cb1 wisdom that does not require any effort on your part it simply comes and goes\cb3 \ \cb1 just as the ocean eps and flows\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you draw awareness to the breath notice if it naturally shifts in any way\cb3 \ \cb1 again there is no need to intervene or manipulate its rhythm but you may find\cb3 \ \cb1 that as you tune into the breath it might naturally deepen slow down or\cb3 \ \cb1 adjust itself in some other way\cb3 \ \cb1 just notice if this is true for you and also notice if it is not there is no\cb3 \ \cb1 right or wrong way to notice the breath simply observe at however it comes and\cb3 \ \cb1 follow it wherever it flows\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 throughout this meditation the mind may entangle itself in thoughts of the past\cb3 \ \cb1 or in visions of what might come to be if for when it does simply acknowledge\cb3 \ \cb1 this tendency as a movement away from this present moment before drawing your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention back to the breath if thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 arise simply witness them for a moment with compassion and non judgment before\cb3 \ \cb1 returning to your unchangeable center no\cb3 \ \cb1 matter how frequently they crop up no that is entirely normal for thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 to rise and entirely possible to gently\cb3 \ \cb1 let them go use the breath as your\cb3 \ \cb1 anchor at any point during this meditation to reground yourself in the\cb3 \ \cb1 physical place that you rest\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your awareness now to the stomach\cb3 \ \cb1 noticing its natural rise and fall as breath moves through you\cb3 \ \cb1 in our busy day to day activities we often breathe primarily from the\cb3 \ \cb1 chest restricting our breaths range of movement this shallow breathing engages\cb3 \ \cb1 our stress response and releases a surge of hormones that temporarily increase\cb3 \ \cb1 our blood pressure as we naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 expand the breaths movement moving it effortlessly into the stomach we\cb3 \ \cb1 activate the relaxation response this\cb3 \ \cb1 deeper breathing pauses out of an inner state of stress and helps us to sink\cb3 \ \cb1 effortlessly into stillness and soon\cb3 \ \cb1 into a state of deep sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to focus your attention on the stomach noticing just how far the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 can go [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] take a moment now to acknowledge this\cb3 \ \cb1 physical place you are in without\cb3 \ \cb1 engaging the Mayans analytic capacity is\cb3 \ \cb1 it possible to simply witness the space you occupy to witness the physical world\cb3 \ \cb1 you are intimately connected to\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] notice the surface that supports you and\cb3 \ \cb1 notice any soft textures around you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your awareness to this very simple moment knowing that there is nowhere\cb3 \ \cb1 else you need to be you are nowhere else\cb3 \ \cb1 but right here right now and all that is\cb3 \ \cb1 asked of you is that you open your heart and awareness to this beautiful moment\cb3 \ \cb1 before you fall into a deep and restorative sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you notice your physical surrounds you may also become more deeply aware of\cb3 \ \cb1 your physical body maintain awareness of\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath flowing through you as you begin to scan the body gently starting\cb3 \ \cb1 at the toes and traveling up to the crown of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] there is nothing you need to look for in this process he was simply called to\cb3 \ \cb1 witness whatever exists within you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if any tension or discomfort appears in your awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 simply embrace it with your loving awareness and open your breath up to\cb3 \ \cb1 this area that is calling for your tender love and air\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] if there are no strong sensations to notice simply grant your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 with your compassionate attention and let it melt further into stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] feel entirely free to also make any physical adjustments to

your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 to guide you towards a place of complete stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] although we will be moving through the expansive field of time you can always\cb3 \ \cb1 ground yourself back into the present moment if you feel uncomfortable at any\cb3 \ \cb1 point you are in complete control of this journey so if any images or\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations arise that are too challenging for you to present Lee look at simply use your breath to anchor\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself back into the present moment you are always always in control of your\cb3 \ \cb1 journey with that said if any\cb3 \ \cb1 challenging images arise or if the experience becomes heavy you are also in\cb3 \ \cb1 an entirely safe domain to explore them images that arise in our consciousness\cb3 \ \cb1 can never hurt us they are solely tools or teachers that hold the potential to\cb3 \ \cb1 guide us forward in powerful and positive ways know that you are\cb3 \ \cb1 universally supported in each and every moment now take a moment to come back to\cb3 \ \cb1 your body notice your sense of touch through the\cb3 \ \cb1 way the surfaces around you make contact with your physical body feel into the\cb3 \ \cb1 textures that are present without moving noting how they feel as they rest\cb3 \ \cb1 against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 consider the deeper levels of the physical body is it possible to become\cb3 \ \cb1 mindful of the cellular world notice\cb3 \ \cb1 your muscles and then invite them to relax encouraging them to sink further\cb3 \ \cb1 into the surface beneath you now\cb3 \ \cb1 consider the presence of air around your body and then gently follow it as it\cb3 \ \cb1 moves within filling your lungs fully as\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a breath in and returning to\cb3 \ \cb1 the world around you on your exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the breath to become slow and steady just like the subtle lapping of\cb3 \ \cb1 waves against the shoreline [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few breaths on your own here following the innate rhythm of this life\cb3 \ \cb1 force that supports you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to come into a state of relaxation by drawing your breath to the\cb3 \ \cb1 heart space as you inhale allow your\cb3 \ \cb1 heart to expand filling itself to the outer edges with peace joy and clarity\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and as you exhale allow the walls of the\cb3 \ \cb1 heart to soften releasing any tension that may be stored there\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe this way for a few more rounds effortlessly quietening the\cb3 \ \cb1 mind as you move closer and closer towards the true state of your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] begin to notice a growing sense of peace\cb3 \ \cb1 and tranquility as you become more attuned with the ever unfolding present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment in just a few moments we will\cb3 \ \cb1 begin our regression into the past allow your imagination to enrich your visions\cb3 \ \cb1 as you move further and further into the mystical landscape we are about to enter\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] for just a few moments allow the space\cb3 \ \cb1 before your third eye to empty completely\cb3 \ \cb1 you may still see various colors and swirls of energy passing before you\cb3 \ \cb1 there is no need to change or attempt to control this instead see if you can\cb3 \ \cb1 simply observe whatever is present there just in front of your closed eyes you\cb3 \ \cb1 don't have to judge it or attempt to change it in any way simply notice the\cb3 \ \cb1 space that quietly and safely hold you in complete stillness in just a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 you will sink as far into relaxation as is required for your personal present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment and needs simply follow my voice as I count down guiding you deeper and\cb3 \ \cb1 deeper into a state of all-encompassing peace and tranquility 10\cb3 \ \cb1 you are feeling safe and secure embraced by this open space 9 all stress and\cb3 \ \cb1 tension is being released with every breath you take 8 you are feeling heavy\cb3 \ \cb1 nourished by the energy around you 7 you\cb3 \ \cb1 are releasing even further 6 every\cb3 \ \cb1 muscle is relaxed 5 you are completely\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable to let go for sinking\cb3 \ \cb1 further and further 3\cb3 \ \cb1 the mind is quiet unless you have come to relax completely\cb3 \ \cb1 - you breathe slowly deeply and\cb3 \ \cb1 effortlessly and one you have arrived\cb3 \ \cb1 completely at peace completely relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] all is quiet or is at peace now\cb3 \ \cb1 something starts to appear before your eyes out of the vast empty space before\cb3 \ \cb1 you you notice a mist developing it is airy\cb3 \ \cb1 and then chanted somehow beckoning you closer you take a few steps towards this\cb3 \ \cb1 mist very slowly and mindfully and as\cb3 \ \cb1 you approach it begins to dissipate as it slowly clears you begin to see there\cb3 \ \cb1 is a bridge ahead of you covered in moss and vines you make your way towards it\cb3 \ \cb1 mindfully treading on the pressed earth beneath your feet and as you cross over\cb3 \ \cb1 everything you ever knew begins to disappear all thought all attachments\cb3 \ \cb1 all fears and all worries\cb3 \ \cb1 you are entering into a new world into a different time with every step you take\cb3 \ \cb1 you inch closer towards the space and time just on the other side of the\cb3 \ \cb1 bridge it is a place that feels familiar\cb3 \ \cb1 somehow but one that your conscious mind cannot put any memory to the mist continues to\cb3 \ \cb1 clear and you realize you are within a dense majestic forest you feel at home\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel at peace here\cb3 \ \cb1 he reached the other side of the bridge and with the mist having vanished completely now you take a closer look at\cb3 \ \cb1 the scenery around you notice the colors and textures of this vibrant forest\cb3 \ \cb1 consider the way the earth feels beneath your feet\cb3 \ \cb1 you heighten your awareness of the aroma that awakens as you inhale deeply allow\cb3 \ \cb1 this place to nurture the deep sense of peace that is within you you walk\cb3 \ \cb1 forward ever so slightly as you noticed something peeking through from within\cb3 \ \cb1 the trees and as you approach you\cb3 \ \cb1 realize there is a cabin hidden within these woods and somehow you sense that\cb3 \ \cb1 it is or was your own you instantly\cb3 \ \cb1 remember it perhaps becoming flooded with visions of what it was once like in\cb3 \ \cb1 your own time you reach the front door and enter\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments to witness the visuals that are arising what does the\cb3 \ \cb1 cabin look like what happened here once upon a time who\cb3 \ \cb1 is with you imagery may come slowly and subtly\cb3 \ \cb1 simply allow them to arise in their own time allow your imagination and\cb3 \ \cb1 intuition to expand quite effortlessly\cb3 \ \cb1 mindfully consider what was once here that no longer remains\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 remain open to whatever arises there is no need to fear the past it no longer\cb3 \ \cb1 has any control over you simply allow yourself to become the outside observer\cb3 \ \cb1 of whatever you feel has happened here\cb3 \ \cb1 watch this film play out as if you are a viewer rather than the character at\cb3 \ \cb1 center stage [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe deeply as you simply observe whatever is present without\cb3 \ \cb1 judgment to our condemnation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as we move through this time we shed old\cb3 \ \cb1 ways of being in order to make room for more expansive ones mindfully begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 consider what messages or lessons are being shared through these images that are arising what is there to be learned\cb3 \ \cb1 what is there to shed\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the mind to remain quiet as your\cb3 \ \cb1 intuition arises tune in with your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 opening yourself to the possibility of transformation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 return to your breath and to the aroma of the woods\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few more moments to witness whatever once happened at this beautiful cabin in the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and slowly in your own time returned to\cb3 \ \cb1 the bridge slowly crossing back over as you return\cb3 \ \cb1 to the present physical reality you\cb3 \ \cb1 passed through the mist once more making your way to the other side 10 you are\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing deeply 9 you feel inspired and\cb3 \ \cb1 uplifted by what you have learned 8 you\cb3 \ \cb1 are calm and relaxed 7 your breath flows\cb3 \ \cb1 as steady as gentle waves caressing the shore 6 the past fading now 5 you feel\cb3 \ \cb1 deeply connected to the physical world for you exhale deeply letting everything\cb3 \ \cb1 melt away [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 three you feel gratitude for the present reality you are in two\cb3 \ \cb1 you know that you are whole and complete in this very moment one you have arrived\cb3 \ \cb1 you are home once again you are at peace\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 with the past now behind you you feel deeply settled within this present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment you know that the past cannot be changed but that it provides opportunity\cb3 \ \cb1 for growth and expansion everything you\cb3 \ \cb1 witnessed now dissipates just as the mist did as you crossed over and into\cb3 \ \cb1 the past you are still and silent and\cb3 \ \cb1 for the moment nothing remains to be seen\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue to allow positive and empowering lessons to reach you as you\cb3 \ \cb1 transition into a sleeping state but you are not in search of anything you are\cb3 \ \cb1 ready to rest easy for the entire night ahead dozing off swiftly and soundly\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few more breaths mindfully inhaling peace contentment and freedom\cb3 \ \cb1 and exhaling everything whatever once\cb3 \ \cb1 was [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the only place that truly exists is this\cb3 \ \cb1 very moment everything that once was can\cb3 \ \cb1 be used as a tool for self-realization at some future moment but for now allow\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath to gently rock you to sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to be nourished throughout the night ahead repeat the\cb3 \ \cb1 following words to yourself in silence as you gently fall into a deep slumber I\cb3 \ \cb1 am at home I am supported I am at peace\cb3 \ \cb1 I am home I am supported\cb3 \ \cb1 I am at peace I am

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation as you\cb3 \ \cb1 prepare for a deep and nourishing sleep this meditation will guide you into\cb3 \ \cb1 manifesting a beautiful and loving relationship of your highest dreams one\cb3 \ \cb1 that is in alignment with your truest self the relationship that you come to\cb3 \ \cb1 manifest will be aligned with your own unique needs and personal journey\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps it is a romantic partner you are currently attracting or a deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 friendship of some other form regardless\cb3 \ \cb1 of what your heart most deeply yearns for this meditation will help you to\cb3 \ \cb1 manifest that relationship upon a foundation of trust allowing you to rest\cb3 \ \cb1 easy and sing into a deep and enriching\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 so before we begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 using any desired cushions or blankets for support and warmth and adjust your\cb3 \ \cb1 body so that it rests comfortably allow\cb3 \ \cb1 the body to move itself so that any physical or tension or tightness can\cb3 \ \cb1 begin the process of release so just\cb3 \ \cb1 prepare yourself and your environment in any way necessary so that this day may\cb3 \ \cb1 be left behind set any alarms now and\cb3 \ \cb1 turn off all lights if your mind and body a moment to sink into this place\cb3 \ \cb1 and time exactly as it is knowing that\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing more to do or to be taken care of\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] now take a moment to connect with your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath without trying to change it or\cb3 \ \cb1 manipulate it in any way I invite you to simply become aware of\cb3 \ \cb1 its natural flow our breath carries an\cb3 \ \cb1 innate wisdom of its own and does not need to be altered in any way while it\cb3 \ \cb1 is sometimes beneficial to deepen or direct the breath in certain manners for\cb3 \ \cb1 right now I invite you to simply be very present with the natural state of your\cb3 \ \cb1 being [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 there may be aspects of the day that linger in your mind or there may be\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts about tomorrow if any of these\cb3 \ \cb1 sorts of thoughts exist within you simply witness them acknowledging that\cb3 \ \cb1 they are not required in this very moment remind yourself that there is\cb3 \ \cb1 nothing to be done here and now all that\cb3 \ \cb1 is required of you is deep presence with your breath and with this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your attention now to the hard space as you breathe allow the heart to\cb3 \ \cb1 gently expand with each inhalation and gently soften with each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few silent breaths here from your heart center as you begin to

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided nighttime\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation that is aimed to help you wind down both body and mind\cb3 \ \cb1 before sleep often times we get into bed with our heart set on getting a great\cb3 \ \cb1 night's sleep an overactive body or mind or both stand in the way of our\cb3 \ \cb1 achieving this deep relaxation that we yearned for so to address this challenge\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation will help you to soften all of that interactivity and tension as\cb3 \ \cb1 you find yourself drifting naturally and gracefully into a sound sleep so before\cb3 \ \cb1 we begin I invite you to take a moment or two to ensure that all of your end-of-day activities are taken care of\cb3 \ \cb1 lights turned off alarms set if needed and anything else that might stand in\cb3 \ \cb1 the way of your fullest relaxation you can address this\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and once everything is taken care of\cb3 \ \cb1 just getting comfortable in your sleeping or lying down position your\cb3 \ \cb1 neck should be aligned with the spine and your arms and legs are free to fall and rest where they may and take a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 breath in now and out and allowing\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to surrender a little bit into the surface beneath you take a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 here to simply acknowledge the present state of your mind [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 without judging or evaluating or trying to change anything see if you might\cb3 \ \cb1 observe whatever thoughts or feelings are present from a place of subtle\cb3 \ \cb1 separation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] it doesn't need to be any attachment to whatever you were witnessing just a soft\cb3 \ \cb1 and compassionate acknowledgement of your present state of being\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now softly surrender is focused awareness as you shift your attention to\cb3 \ \cb1 the natural rhythm of your breath [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can follow each inhalation and exhalation and mindfully observing\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever sensations are present you\cb3 \ \cb1 might notice the depth of your breath and its speed or rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] but in any case see if you can accept\cb3 \ \cb1 your current state of being without trying to change it in any way\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you observe your breath you might notice it beginning to deepen\cb3 \ \cb1 and quite often when we draw our attention in a loving and non-judgmental\cb3 \ \cb1 way to the breath it begins to expand on its own you might observe the belly\cb3 \ \cb1 softening or the shoulders falling whatever your experience feels like is\cb3 \ \cb1 entirely welcome\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 whether we are consciously aware of it or not our body and mind is connected so\cb3 \ \cb1 when there is tension in either body or mind it often impacts the well-being of\cb3 \ \cb1 the other aspect of ourselves sometimes we're not entirely aware of the tension\cb3 \ \cb1 we hold on to until we start to consciously release it so what we are\cb3 \ \cb1 going to do is we're going to move through a gentle though powerful practice of tension and release as you\cb3 \ \cb1 hear each body part mentioned I invite you to bring attention or tightness to\cb3 \ \cb1 this region and then to release it completely on your following breath out\cb3 \ \cb1 so to begin draw your attention down to your feet on your next in-breath curling\cb3 \ \cb1 them in and holding them tightly for a brief moment and on your next exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 release this tension completely [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe slowly and mindfully in between body parts noticing the wave of\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation that pervades the mind as we move through this practice\cb3 \ \cb1 now bring a tightness to both legs pulling them in and holding them just\cb3 \ \cb1 for a moment and release them on the\cb3 \ \cb1 exhalation perhaps relaxing more thoroughly through a deep sigh\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next breath in contract the space within your pelvis region and your\cb3 \ \cb1 backside holding for just a brief moment\cb3 \ \cb1 and then soften these areas on your exhalation and melting further into the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface that support you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 shifting your focus now up to your belly tightening your core muscles on your\cb3 \ \cb1 next inhalation Titan and as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 allow all the muscles here to relax completely feel a complete surrender in\cb3 \ \cb1 your core taking a few slow deep breaths into your belly now\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your attention now to your hands tightening them into fists on your next\cb3 \ \cb1 inhalation tighten and as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your fingers and palms to soften completely\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] on your next inhalation pull your arms\cb3 \ \cb1 into your sides squeezing and holding for just a moment and as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 allow them to surrender completely to gravity [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 bring a subtle and inward pull to your shoulders and upper chest area on your\cb3 \ \cb1 next inhalation and tighten and relax\cb3 \ \cb1 these areas completely allowing the shoulders to fall back and the hard area\cb3 \ \cb1 to soften and expand [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now I invite you to focus on the muscles in your face tightening your jaw your\cb3 \ \cb1 cheeks your forehead but just a moment really tense really tighten and as you\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale allow all face muscles to soften completely let go\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 lastly I invite you to tense your entire body or any particular region that you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel requires further release and hold here for just a moment as you observe\cb3 \ \cb1 the sensation of tension here on your\cb3 \ \cb1 next outward breath let the entire physical body go letting gravity nourish\cb3 \ \cb1 you as it holds you safely and comfortably on the bed or other service\cb3 \ \cb1 that supports you here [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 just take a few moments of silence here to ground yourself through the breath once again subtly observing the\cb3 \ \cb1 underlying restful state of both body and mind\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if it feels more comfortable to sink into sleep in a different position you're welcome to shift your posture at\cb3 \ \cb1 any time and if or as you move positions\cb3 \ \cb1 just move slowly and mindfully embodying this peaceful state of being that you\cb3 \ \cb1 have transitioned into [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if any thoughts arise in the forefront of your mind attempting to pull you away from this\cb3 \ \cb1 inner peace continue observing these invisible movements of energy by\cb3 \ \cb1 silently whispering to yourself I see you and I release you I see you and I\cb3 \ \cb1 release you I see you and I release you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now allowing all thoughts to be gently surrendered as they arise see if he can\cb3 \ \cb1 tune into the blank canvas that exists before the mind's eye and in this space\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to visualize yourself standing at the edge of a majestic lake the ancient\cb3 \ \cb1 pines that surround the shore the clouds that fill the sky and the subtle stars\cb3 \ \cb1 that begin to appear overhead as the night approaches\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] each of these elements adds to the\cb3 \ \cb1 wonder of this space you are witnessing\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the waters are calm and clear mirroring\cb3 \ \cb1 the pink orange and fading blue sky above [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel equally peaceful silently\cb3 \ \cb1 whispering the beauty and radiance of this simple moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you stand firmly grounded on a rocky peninsula that slopes gently towards the\cb3 \ \cb1 water barefoot you feel into the cool\cb3 \ \cb1 rock beneath you kneeling deeply connected to and supported by the\cb3 \ \cb1 physical earth this connection you now\cb3 \ \cb1 hold with nature inspires you to seek more of this natural comfort in your\cb3 \ \cb1 waking life to return to this natural\cb3 \ \cb1 place whenever you seek clarity peace or\cb3 \ \cb1 release\cb3 \ \cb1 just to your right a narrow dark extends from the shore at the end of it a\cb3 \ \cb1 floating raft gently bobbles atop the still water\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as the Sun sets we begin to feel tired\cb3 \ \cb1 hoping to drift off beneath the stars that grow brighter and brighter as the\cb3 \ \cb1 sky darkens so you begin to slowly and\cb3 \ \cb1 mindfully make your way down the dock soon coming to reach the raft that\cb3 \ \cb1 floats at the end of it [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 upon reaching the raft you notice that there are already cushions and blankets\cb3 \ \cb1 set up for you making yourself comfortable you come to\cb3 \ \cb1 rest here lying down gently beneath the stars overhead a gentle lapping of water\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath the raft lulls you closer and closer toward sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you listen to it the mind begins to fall away and your inner peace rises to\cb3 \ \cb1 the surface [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 before drifting off however you take one long last look up towards the cosmos\cb3 \ \cb1 witnessing the stars here surrounded by the beauty and peace of this natural\cb3 \ \cb1 landscape it is enough to melt all worries and fears away\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] all tensions are released from both body\cb3 \ \cb1 and mind as you develop a deep trust in the grander vision of life the Stars\cb3 \ \cb1 offer you this heightened perspective [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you close your eyes on even the stars now tuning into the sound and sensations\cb3 \ \cb1 observed here the water continues to lap\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath the raft and the subtle rocking makes you feel deeply connected to the\cb3 \ \cb1 water beneath you to the flow of life itself and to this unique and wonderful\cb3 \ \cb1 journey you are honored\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you return to your breath now witnessing\cb3 \ \cb1 the natural ebb and flow of this life force as it passes through your physical\cb3 \ \cb1 being [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next in breath just allow the heart and belly to expand completely and\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe out release any last traces of tension perhaps with a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 sigh to help you settle\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] now gently allow the notion of this\cb3 \ \cb1 majestic lake to dissipate as you tune into your physical presence wherever you\cb3 \ \cb1 are\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the comfort and support of the surface beneath you the nourishment of\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath as it flows through you and the piece that is observable beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 the layers of your mind [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] with nothing left to envision and nothing left to do you are ready to let\cb3 \ \cb1 the day come to an end so that another may arrive when you were well-rested\cb3 \ \cb1 letting everything go gently allow yourself to drift into a deep and steady\cb3 \ \cb1 slumber as you fall to sleep allow the\cb3 \ \cb1

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided bedtime\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation that will help you to fall asleep quickly and soundly over the\cb3 \ \cb1 course of this meditation you will move deeper and deeper into a state of\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation releasing all physical tension before being guided into a\cb3 \ \cb1 beautiful visualization that will enhance your inner sense of peace and tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing required for you to actively do here you are simply invited\cb3 \ \cb1 to open your mind as you are guided naturally towards a peaceful slumber\cb3 \ \cb1 before you settle into the space you're in take a moment to ensure that your\cb3 \ \cb1 blinds are drawn and your morning alarm is set when you're ready to put the day\cb3 \ \cb1 behind you and sure you're in a comfortable lying down position as you prepare for complete release and\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation use any blankets and cushions to support yourself as necessary and\cb3 \ \cb1 when you are in utmost comfort take a few slow and grounding breaths to\cb3 \ \cb1 connect with this moment in space and time\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath is a gateway into the present moment and into deep release and greater\cb3 \ \cb1 alignment though this invisible life forced often goes overlooked it is one\cb3 \ \cb1 of the most powerful tools of relaxation available to us in any given moment so\cb3 \ \cb1 take this opportunity now to witness the breath to simply observe its depth and\cb3 \ \cb1 rhythm allowing it to deepen as you naturally ease your way into this period\cb3 \ \cb1 of darkness draw your attention to the\cb3 \ \cb1 stomach noticing the way the breath follows suit as we consciously welcome\cb3 \ \cb1 our breath into the belly we initiate the body's relaxation response lowering\cb3 \ \cb1 stress hormones blood pressure muscle tension and our breathing rate\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale all the way into the base of the spine and then exhale completely\cb3 \ \cb1 softening all muscles as you surrender a little bit further\cb3 \ \cb1 now I invite you to introduce small pauses between inhalation and exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 resting in complete stillness for just a moment after each in-breath and each out\cb3 \ \cb1 breath\cb3 \ \cb1 so it's going to be inhale to a count of four pause for a brief moment and then\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale completely for a count of four pausing for just a moment of complete\cb3 \ \cb1 stillness once again witness the body\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxing more fully as you breathe in the slow and steady way for three more\cb3 \ \cb1 rounds on your own now\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 gently release your attention from the breath now tuning into the visceral\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations of the body hold the entire\cb3 \ \cb1 body in your awareness for a few moments noticing if there's any physical tension\cb3 \ \cb1 or contraction present if you come\cb3 \ \cb1 across any area in need of love and release just gently draw your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 towards this region on your next inhalation inviting nourishing light to\cb3 \ \cb1 support your full release and as you\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale allow all tightness and all tension to dissipate feeling yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 sink more completely into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 as you welcome release into the physical body through your breath the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 naturally follows suit moving into greater peace and harmony so\cb3 \ \cb1 follow my voice as you are guided through the body using the power of your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention to grant full release begin by\cb3 \ \cb1 a breathing loving-kindness into the feet area releasing any heaviness that\cb3 \ \cb1 may be stored here\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe into the legs now thanking these limbs for carrying you throughout your\cb3 \ \cb1 day and then allowing them to relax completely into this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] inhale deeply now into the hips and\cb3 \ \cb1 pelvis softening and releasing on the exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 and then move to the belly allowing your core muscles to relax and the breath to\cb3 \ \cb1 flow effortlessly into this area of the body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hope in your heart and chest now as you breathe nourishing lifeforce\cb3 \ \cb1 into this center of your pain softening on the exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 soften your hands allowing them to sink into the surface beneath you and then\cb3 \ \cb1 grant the same release to your arms just letting them melt away for the night\cb3 \ \cb1 soften your shoulders your neck region\cb3 \ \cb1 your jaw\cb3 \ \cb1 your cheeks and nose\cb3 \ \cb1 and your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to soften the eyebrows in the forward just allowing all mental\cb3 \ \cb1 tension to dissipate as you release all muscles surrounding your thinking mind\cb3 \ \cb1 hold your entire body in your awareness now allowing it to be completely at\cb3 \ \cb1 peace in this present moment return to\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath for a couple more cycles noticing once again the short pauses in\cb3 \ \cb1 between each in-breath and each out breath\cb3 \ \cb1 now feeling physically relaxed and in alignment with this present moment I\cb3 \ \cb1 invite you to tune in to the mind's eye without force or strain allow the\cb3 \ \cb1 following visualization to conjure images of deep peace and tranquility as\cb3 \ \cb1 you move gracefully into a deep slumber for the night in your open field of\cb3 \ \cb1 vision now begin to visualize you're on a tropical island feet firmly grounded\cb3 \ \cb1 into the warm crystals of sand that stretch out to either side of you where\cb3 \ \cb1 you rest the waters are shallow off the coast lending themselves to crystal\cb3 \ \cb1 clear turquoise hues and the most beautiful waters you have ever laid eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 on\cb3 \ \cb1 the salty breeze infiltrates your nostrils and you exhale deeply feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself sink further into this paradise island that warms both body and soul\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a few steps forward slowly eventually coming to dip your toes in\cb3 \ \cb1 the warm yet refreshing waters that surround this small Paradise Island\cb3 \ \cb1 standing at a balance point between ocean and earth ankle deep in those\cb3 \ \cb1 turquoise waters inner peace flows through you as you come to realize you\cb3 \ \cb1 are whole and complete just as you are\cb3 \ \cb1 you yearn to dive into the healing salty waters before you and so prepare\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself for this descent when you are\cb3 \ \cb1 ready you begin to walk slowly and mindfully away from the steady Shore\cb3 \ \cb1 step by step until soon your lower legs are submerged you continue walking\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly and with grace until soon you are\cb3 \ \cb1 waist-deep in these cleansing waters you\cb3 \ \cb1 pause here tracing the surface of the ocean with your fingertips and when you\cb3 \ \cb1 are ready you reach your arms ahead of you as you shallow dive into the crystal\cb3 \ \cb1 clarity that now bathes your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 as each crystal bead of ocean rushes along your skin you feel restored and\cb3 \ \cb1 renewed\cb3 \ \cb1 turning onto your back you allow your body to float on the still surface the\cb3 \ \cb1 ocean is calm and quiet nestling you\cb3 \ \cb1 continually into a peaceful state that lives both within and around you the\cb3 \ \cb1 salt water cleanses your skin rejuvenating your physical body\cb3 \ \cb1 energetically it penetrates deeper healing and nourishing your spiritual\cb3 \ \cb1 and emotional bodies all trapped emotions and all old energy systems are\cb3 \ \cb1 absorbed by the healing potential of these waters this process of renewal\cb3 \ \cb1 leaves you free to relax completely\cb3 \ \cb1 floating here on the surface of the water you are in a state of complete\cb3 \ \cb1 bliss\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the mind softens entirely nothing\cb3 \ \cb1 tethered to it any longer any thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 that do rise in your consciousness are released to the ocean as swiftly as they came you know that any thoughts or\cb3 \ \cb1 emotions that arise do not belong to you there are simply bodies of energy coming\cb3 \ \cb1 like waves before dissolving back into the wholeness of the ocean\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 Aya's transfixed with the sky you notice the lighting and shade overhead is\cb3 \ \cb1 shifting blue hues now blend into a subtle orange signifying that the Sun is\cb3 \ \cb1 now setting behind the horizon you take\cb3 \ \cb1 this as a cue to return to land turning back towards the beach and the canopy of\cb3 \ \cb1 palm trees that overhang it\cb3 \ \cb1 you return to your feet gliding out of the water slowly step by step\cb3 \ \cb1 you finally come to reach land and find that a plush towel neatly folded on the\cb3 \ \cb1 warm sand has been sent for you by the universe you wrap yourself in this warm\cb3 \ \cb1 soothing towel and begin to walk slowly down the beach into the sunset\cb3 \ \cb1 as you walk you open your senses to this environment\cb3 \ \cb1 you notice the aroma of the salty air continually cleansing you with each\cb3 \ \cb1 breath\cb3 \ \cb1 you taste the salt on the outer edges of your lips left behind from your healing\cb3 \ \cb1 dip in the ocean\cb3 \ \cb1 you hear the gentle rustling of palm trees a subtle lapping of water against\cb3 \ \cb1 the shore and the sound of release that comes with each deep exhale you make\cb3 \ \cb1 tuning into your sense of touch you feel the warmth and comfort of the towel\cb3 \ \cb1 against your skin as well as the sweetness of sand beneath your feet\cb3 \ \cb1 staring ahead you see the crest of beautiful palm trees the white sand\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly becoming darker as night approaches and the vibrant sky now\cb3 \ \cb1 orange and magenta as the Sun has disappeared behind the horizon just a\cb3 \ \cb1 dozen yards ahead of you firmly grounded in the shallow waters by sturdy stilts\cb3 \ \cb1 you see an overwater bungalow connected to the shore by a long wooden dock this\cb3 \ \cb1 is your own private Cabana where you will sleep the night away in tranquillity step-by-step continuing to\cb3 \ \cb1 move slowly and mindfully you make your way back to the dock you arrive at the\cb3 \ \cb1 foot of it and see that string lights lie in both railings\cb3 \ \cb1 as you make your way towards your private bungalow by ferry light you feel\cb3 \ \cb1 the day behind you dissipating naturally you reach the end\cb3 \ \cb1 of the dock arriving at the door of your Cabana turning the handle you make your\cb3 \ \cb1 way inside and admire the beautiful warm interiors that nourish mind body and\cb3 \ \cb1 spirit a large glass window who\cb3 \ \cb1 reacquaint you with the Sun when it rises and fresh fruits will energize\cb3 \ \cb1 your body when morning arrives for now\cb3 \ \cb1 you turn your full attention to the four-poster bed in the center of the\cb3 \ \cb1 room a plush white quilt is draped over\cb3 \ \cb1 top and white lace curtains pulled back and tied elegantly to each side\cb3 \ \cb1 preparing a suffering deep slumber you climb inside this cozy and welcoming bed\cb3 \ \cb1 ready to rest peacefully for the night so that you may wake inspired and\cb3 \ \cb1 energized when morning comes notice the\cb3 \ \cb1 comfort of the blankets and cushions that support you here notice the peace\cb3 \ \cb1 and quiet that beckons you into a deep slumber\cb3 \ \cb1 all you hear are the subtle sounds of the ocean and your own slow steady\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing take a few last moments to\cb3 \ \cb1 revel in this beauty of this setting soaking it up in spirit gently allow the\cb3 \ \cb1 visuals to dissipate returning to your physical reality carrying the same peace\cb3 \ \cb1 and stillness you've found there by the ocean you are safe and supported here\cb3 \ \cb1 resting peacefully and soundly as you slowly slip into a deep slumber\cb3 \ \cb1 as you drift off to sleep allow the\cb3 \ \cb1 following affirmations

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music] [Laughter] [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided visualization\cb3 \ \cb1 it's designed to promote peace of mind for returned soldiers experiencing\cb3 \ \cb1 post-traumatic stress upon returning home before we move into this visual\cb3 \ \cb1 journey I would like to acknowledge that this recording is not a replacement for\cb3 \ \cb1 professional support but rather it is a tool that can help you to explore the\cb3 \ \cb1 possibility of finding a safe and comfortable place within yourself it is\cb3 \ \cb1 an anchor into the present moment of\cb3 \ \cb1 course I encourage anyone listening to this to seek the support that they need from professionals and use this\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation solely as a peaceful way to help you find peace and release during\cb3 \ \cb1 those quiet moments before falling asleep so before we begin I invite you\cb3 \ \cb1 to make sure that you are entirely comfortable in the place that you are now in if there's anything that brings\cb3 \ \cb1 you extra peace and comfort reach out for these now and this could be as\cb3 \ \cb1 simple as your pillow a sacred object on your bedside table or anything at all\cb3 \ \cb1 that brings you more comfort so making sure that you're in a\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable lying down position and take a few full settling breaths here as you\cb3 \ \cb1 ground yourself into this space\cb3 \ \cb1 at any point during this meditation or at any point throughout the days and\cb3 \ \cb1 nights to come I invite you to remember that your breath is always available as\cb3 \ \cb1 an anchor into the present moment each time we draw our awareness to the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 the past disappears the future disappears and we are reminded of the\cb3 \ \cb1 stillness that lives in this very moment breath awareness requires nothing but\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention and can be practiced at any time for just a few seconds or for\cb3 \ \cb1 many so right now follow my voice for\cb3 \ \cb1 the next short while as you deepen your awareness of this life force that flows\cb3 \ \cb1 in and out of your body constantly as\cb3 \ \cb1 you inhale become more observant of your sensory experience as the air flows into\cb3 \ \cb1 your nostrils through your windpipe and deep into your lungs\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you exhale witness the release that occurs as the belly softens the\cb3 \ \cb1 chest falls and your mind just drops away\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe with this heightened awareness paying close attention to the\cb3 \ \cb1 pauses in between each breath cycle so\cb3 \ \cb1 after each inhalation see if you can notice the complete stillness where the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath is held for just a brief second and after each exhalation observe that\cb3 \ \cb1 momentary stillness after all the air has been released and just in your own\cb3 \ \cb1 time repeating this observation on your own for a few more breaths cycles\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 know that wherever you have been whatever lingers from days now behind\cb3 \ \cb1 you you exist nowhere but in this present moment reality allow the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and your physical body to remind you of this moving deeply into your physical\cb3 \ \cb1 presence anytime the mind wanders into stories or images of the past you are\cb3 \ \cb1 here you are held by your breath your\cb3 \ \cb1 body and spirit right here\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 while we cannot change what has happened in the past we can continually draw\cb3 \ \cb1 ourselves more affirmative ly into today by welcoming ourselves exactly as we are\cb3 \ \cb1 into the reality of this present moment we find space to honor where we've been\cb3 \ \cb1 while also knowing that we are only ever right here right now this is the only\cb3 \ \cb1 time we truly have so in just a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 you will be guided through a safe and soothing visualization to help you tune\cb3 \ \cb1 into more completely to the present moment take a few more slow and steady\cb3 \ \cb1 breaths and just after a few cycles let's begin\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 shifting your attention now away from your breath and into the empty space\cb3 \ \cb1 behind your closed eyes and this space\cb3 \ \cb1 holds infinite potential for freedom and release when we adorn it with images of\cb3 \ \cb1 peace and light and love so upon this\cb3 \ \cb1 blank canvas I invite you to witness yourself appearing in a place that\cb3 \ \cb1 provides you with a sense of safety and love for you this might be a particular\cb3 \ \cb1 outdoor landscape or it might be an indoor space it might be a setting from\cb3 \ \cb1 your childhood or a place that exists today or it could even be from your\cb3 \ \cb1 imagination [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 there are no rules as to what this space looks like so long as it provides you\cb3 \ \cb1 with the sense that you are safe supported and held exactly as you are\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 explore this space as you please tuning into any and all of your senses that are\cb3 \ \cb1 appropriate here what does the imagery\cb3 \ \cb1 evoke within you\cb3 \ \cb1 are there any aromas textures or tastes\cb3 \ \cb1 that bring about a sense of peace and security\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] what sounds are present in the space\cb3 \ \cb1 that surround you if there are no sounds can the silence carry you deeper into\cb3 \ \cb1 stillness and contentment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a full nourishing inhale and as you\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale just gently release any tension fear or worry letting it go\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now I invite you to welcome other beings into this space if it feels comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 for you whoever brings you a sense of peace and love is welcome here\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps you invite friends to join you family members\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] professionals you've worked with or pets\cb3 \ \cb1 while these beings cannot free you of your past they can support you in your\cb3 \ \cb1 journey as you move forward if you feel\cb3 \ \cb1 more at peace in this space alone know that this is entirely okay as well from\cb3 \ \cb1 moment to moment we require different things sometimes it is the support of\cb3 \ \cb1 those who love us sometimes it is our personal connection to our highest self\cb3 \ \cb1 to nature to universe if the latter is\cb3 \ \cb1 true for you in this moment invite your higher self the natural world or your\cb3 \ \cb1 understanding of God or the universe into the space within you\cb3 \ \cb1 even if you have welcomed humans or pets into the visualization already you too\cb3 \ \cb1 may also invite these deeper connections to support you right now if emotions\cb3 \ \cb1 arise simply acknowledge them and witness them as passing clouds tuning in\cb3 \ \cb1 to how they feel within the body rather than the story that they weave in the\cb3 \ \cb1 mind just trust that this beautiful safe\cb3 \ \cb1 space you have created as the capacity to hold you exactly as you are and know\cb3 \ \cb1 that there is no weakness in feeling emotion our emotions are a part of what\cb3 \ \cb1 makes us human and they are entirely welcome here\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continually returned to the peaceful imagery around you and to whatever you\cb3 \ \cb1 have conjured here that brings you peace [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now wherever you have found yourself in this visualization I invite you to take\cb3 \ \cb1 a seat on the earth or on a couch or any other surface that fits your environment\cb3 \ \cb1 just getting comfortable you might\cb3 \ \cb1 conjure up any supportive elements that make you feel at home you might light a\cb3 \ \cb1 few candles in your mind's eye or surround yourself with any other sacred\cb3 \ \cb1 objects that settle you\cb3 \ \cb1 I invite you to visualize a photo album presenting itself on the floor or a\cb3 \ \cb1 small table before you inscribed in\cb3 \ \cb1 golden cursive print on the cover the album reads for safe keeping in the soul\cb3 \ \cb1 this album has presented itself for you so that you may have a safe space to\cb3 \ \cb1 place any recurring images or dreams about the past whatever you have\cb3 \ \cb1 witnessed and experienced cannot be taken away from you however the past can\cb3 \ \cb1 be laid gently to rest tucked away in a safe corner of the soul to inspire the\cb3 \ \cb1 next stage of your life's purpose\cb3 \ \cb1 take the album in your hands breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 deeply as you hold it in quiet reverence\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] if any challenging thoughts or images\cb3 \ \cb1 arise in your consciousness turn these into photographs and tuck them gently\cb3 \ \cb1 into your album\cb3 \ \cb1 laying the past down this way in help to honor where you've been while creating\cb3 \ \cb1 space for lighter imagery and experiences to take root this is not a\cb3 \ \cb1 denial of where you have been but it may serve as a reminder that these images\cb3 \ \cb1 are snapshots of the past and now you\cb3 \ \cb1 have a brighter lighter future to look forward to [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few more silent moments to respectfully tuck away any old\cb3 \ \cb1 photographs that no longer need to take up space in the forefront of your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 if the imagery does not arise naturally or if it is too painful for you to\cb3 \ \cb1 process in this way at this time tune into the natural rhythm of your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 as you quietly repeat the words right here right now I am safe right here\cb3 \ \cb1 right now I am safe\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 I invite you to close the photo album now knowing that you can come back to it\cb3 \ \cb1 at any time you need to store the passed away for safekeeping and remember that\cb3 \ \cb1 none of this is a denial of the life you have lived it is simply a way of\cb3 \ \cb1 clearing space for new life to emerge\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few final moments now to tune back into the beautiful room or\cb3 \ \cb1 landscape you have visualized using your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath to ground you here for just a few more moments look around at the support\cb3 \ \cb1 systems that are available to you friends family members plants and\cb3 \ \cb1 animals support professionals your highest self the universe anything else\cb3 \ \cb1 in which you find peace meaning and contentment\cb3 \ \cb1 come back to your breath remembering that this very simple life force that we\cb3 \ \cb1 so often take for granted is a pathway back to the present moment back into\cb3 \ \cb1 peace\cb3 \ \cb1 gently now allow the scene you have created to begin dissolving as you\cb3 \ \cb1 reconnect with your awareness of your body in the room and physically support\cb3 \ \cb1 you allow each muscle to soften melting\cb3 \ \cb1 further into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 draw the mind down into the heart space thanking yourself for harnessing the\cb3 \ \cb1 courage and Trust required to move through this journey\cb3 \ \cb1 now as you gently surrender into sleep allow the following affirmations to fuel\cb3 \ \cb1 your continued evolution bringing you deeper into peace contentment and\cb3 \ \cb1 release you may like to mentally repeat\cb3 \ \cb1 these affirmations as you drift off into sleep I love and honor myself I love and\cb3 \ \cb1 honor myself

you prepare for\cb3 \ \cb1 a deeply restorative sleep during this guided meditation you will bring\cb3 \ \cb1 compassion and healing attention to different parts of the body and mind before finding your way into a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 slumber I invite you now to open your heart to the transformative capacity of\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation and to that of your own inner being [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 before we begin take a moment to ensure that everything in the outside world is\cb3 \ \cb1 turned off or put away for the day the lights and any alerts on your phone or\cb3 \ \cb1 other devices are turned off and preferably the blinds are drawn ensuring\cb3 \ \cb1 that all end of day tasks are taken care of will help you to immerse yourself in\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation and into deeply healing sleep once all of the outside\cb3 \ \cb1 requirements are taken care of take some time to ensure that you're in a comfortable lying down position ensure\cb3 \ \cb1 that the body is relaxed and well supported as you come to find stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 wherever you are [Music] gently closing your eyes and take a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment now to see if you can feel into the physical space that supports you\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the way your body is held in the safety and solidity of the physical\cb3 \ \cb1 world know that it is safe for you to let go to allow any held tension to melt\cb3 \ \cb1 away in this very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever presents itself during this or during any meditation is entirely welcomed it is safe for you to be fully\cb3 \ \cb1 present within your experience allow your own inner strength my voice and the\cb3 \ \cb1 deep silence to guide you through this meditation you are well taken care of\cb3 \ \cb1 within your own presence begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 witness the way that breath flows through you come to see how effortlessly\cb3 \ \cb1 it fills your physical body and then how naturally it glides back into the outer\cb3 \ \cb1 environment for a few moments now draw\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention to your breath allowing it to ground you in this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the outside world gently falls away as\cb3 \ \cb1 you are guided continuously via the breath back into this very moment in\cb3 \ \cb1 time now without attempting to change your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath in any way I invite you to draw your attention to the belly simply\cb3 \ \cb1 observe the way it rises and the way it falls and notice what happens to the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath as you draw your attention to the stomach what happens to the body is\cb3 \ \cb1 there a softening or possibly a sense of release is the ease or unease whatever\cb3 \ \cb1 may be the case for you simply acknowledge what is present within the body as you shift your attention from\cb3 \ \cb1 breath to belly [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 getting to know the body in this way facilitates your ability to heal itself\cb3 \ \cb1 this type of getting to know the body is not intellectual in any way it's\cb3 \ \cb1 experiential through this meditation you're invited to become more intimate\cb3 \ \cb1 with the physical body witnessing it exactly as it rests here right in this\cb3 \ \cb1 very moment by practicing this deep\cb3 \ \cb1 presence we shift from thinking into feeling and into being by allowing the\cb3 \ \cb1 body to be exactly as it is and by bringing our awareness to it we begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 soften the mental preconceptions maintaining their firm grip on our beliefs about the body gently allow any\cb3 \ \cb1 firmly held concepts to melt away allowing a deeper experience of full\cb3 \ \cb1 openness and presence to take its place [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 come back to the breath for a few moments allowing it to continually carry\cb3 \ \cb1 you into each unfolding moment breath by\cb3 \ \cb1 breath moment by moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I invite you now to expand the scope of your breath on your next inhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 gently guide or envision the breath spanning all the way down to your toes\cb3 \ \cb1 and on the next exhalation guide the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath to the top of your head nourishing each part as it passes\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to envision the breath looping gently through your body this way\cb3 \ \cb1 softening every area of stress or tension that it touches take a few\cb3 \ \cb1 moments of silence here allowing the breath to soothe every cell of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you come to be more in touch with the body on a deeper level take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 consider that you are made up of trillions of cells each of these cells\cb3 \ \cb1 intermingles with the others in order to keep you alive and well as you rest in\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation the body welcomes this space and time provided to heal itself on a\cb3 \ \cb1 deep level sale a level know that right\cb3 \ \cb1 now the body is taking care of itself to bring you into a greater sense of\cb3 \ \cb1 vitality and wellness so take a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 now to gently scan the body noticing any spiraling sensations of energy moving\cb3 \ \cb1 through you as you come to feel the body on an energetic level see if you begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to consciously touch the cellular level of the body take a few moments of\cb3 \ \cb1 silence here to dive into the subtle realms of the body to those parts that\cb3 \ \cb1 go invisible to the eye [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your awareness naturally to various areas of the body allowing yourself to\cb3 \ \cb1 be guided by your inner compass simply notice what you notice simply allow\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to feel what you feel your own inner wisdom will guide you let any\cb3 \ \cb1 notions about what this experience should be like just to fall away and as\cb3 \ \cb1 you move deeply into yourself take time to notice any areas of tension pain or\cb3 \ \cb1 discomfort [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now this pain or discomfort may be primarily physical it may be emotional\cb3 \ \cb1 or energetic simply notice what areas of your being are calling to you for\cb3 \ \cb1 healing take a moment to focus on one area of the body or mind that is\cb3 \ \cb1 speaking to you through discomfort or tension as you bring your attention to\cb3 \ \cb1 this area allow your breath to follow this awareness just gently and naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your breath and your inner capacity for compassion to touch this place\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 without trying to change anything about this experience allow the discomfort to\cb3 \ \cb1 be bathed by the warmth of your breath and by your loving presence so take a\cb3 \ \cb1 few moments of silence here as you allow your body to heal on a cellular level\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now gently loosen your attention coming back to the rhythm of your natural\cb3 \ \cb1 breath remember that your breath is your anchor and if at any point your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 wanders your breath is always available to redirect you to your present\cb3 \ \cb1 experience so come now to a different\cb3 \ \cb1 area of the body or mind to a second aspect of you in need of a little extra\cb3 \ \cb1 support care or tenderness invite this\cb3 \ \cb1 place into your awareness as you cleanse it with your inner infinite well of love\cb3 \ \cb1 and kindness\cb3 \ \cb1 hold it compassionately in your field of awareness allowing the breath to soothe\cb3 \ \cb1 it and as you breathe let any tension or pain that is held there to slowly soften\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] continue to breathe consciously as we\cb3 \ \cb1

and supported\cb3 \ \cb1 throughout this meditation in each and every moment that unfolds\cb3 \ \cb1 you to come into a comfortable lying down position any resting position will do but try to\cb3 \ \cb1 ensure that your chest is open and your neck is in line with your spine\cb3 \ \cb1 just sink a little bit further into the surface that supports you\cb3 \ \cb1 the physical world will nurture you throughout the journey so feel free to invite the intention to surrender to\cb3 \ \cb1 your body and mind at this present moment letting yourself sink deeply into the\cb3 \ \cb1 physical space beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 to help affirm moment to repeat the following words\cb3 \ \cb1 after me I am free to let go\cb3 \ \cb1 I am free to let go I am free to let go\cb3 \ \cb1 now gently release any and all words that are circulating within the mind as\cb3 \ \cb1 you open your heart and body allowing them to guide the way\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation is aimed to help you release tension in the body and to let\cb3 \ \cb1 go of all stress and unease that is present in the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 as we move through life it is not uncommon to become weighed down by\cb3 \ \cb1 things that have happened in the past by things we think we are\cb3 \ \cb1 by things we think that other people are by fears about the future\cb3 \ \cb1 and while there are doubtedly many challenges that exist in this human experience\cb3 \ \cb1 we can help to reset both body and mind by consciously inviting ourselves to\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender or resistance to this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 because the truth is that cannot harm you\cb3 \ \cb1 cannot harm you is here to nourish and support you\cb3 \ \cb1 so take a few deep breaths now as you remind yourself that you are entirely\cb3 \ \cb1 safe right here right now\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 now draw your awareness to the natural rhythm of your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 without trying to change it in any way simply observe its flow and depth in\cb3 \ \cb1 this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 notice any sensations that are present as you inhale deeply through the nose\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you exhale completely allowing your lungs and belly to soften entirely\cb3 \ \cb1 you notice the sound of the breath makes\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the way the breath interacts with the physical body putting any visceral sensations as it\cb3 \ \cb1 moves through you a few moments of silence he\cb3 \ \cb1 simply observing your direct experience of the breath right at this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your attention now to the belly and observe the way the breath follows you there\cb3 \ \cb1 allow each inhalation to expand the stomach completely\cb3 \ \cb1 exhalation to soften the belly letting all tension and contraction of muscles\cb3 \ \cb1 melt away the depths of the belly as you breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing your breath to move freely to the furthest corners of the body\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 as we mindfully allow the breath to touch deeper reaches of the respiratory system we unconsciously activate the\cb3 \ \cb1 body's relaxation response this response helps to slow a racing\cb3 \ \cb1 heart sue the worried mind and release tense muscles\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments of silence now to consciously observe the belly and the breath flowing in harmony\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 I invite you now to tune into your sense of sound\cb3 \ \cb1 labeling or judging anything that filters through your ears simply become\cb3 \ \cb1 aware of the vibrations that enter your awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 sounds maybe near\cb3 \ \cb1 subtle hole loud\cb3 \ \cb1 just note them without hanging on to them allowing them to come and go the\cb3 \ \cb1 way waves and flow\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 now as you tune into the sound of the rain\cb3 \ \cb1 beginning to fill your eardrums begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 observe the way it cleanses your body of everything it has been holding on to for\cb3 \ \cb1 some time rain is a beautiful and\cb3 \ \cb1 powerful tool of transformation that will help to nourish and cleanse your entire being through your journey so\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender gently now to the healing rain that falls through your awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 carry your attention away from your sense of sound now as you move more deeply into your sense of touch take a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment to observe each area of your physical body that is in contact with\cb3 \ \cb1 the surface beneath you see if you can notice the temperature and texture of\cb3 \ \cb1 each surface that is nestled against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can release a little bit further still into the bed or any other\cb3 \ \cb1 surface that support you\cb3 \ \cb1 now to prepare the soil for the mind to feel free and safe to let go of all\cb3 \ \cb1 worried and repetitive thoughts let us move more deeply into the body I invite\cb3 \ \cb1 you now to follow my voice as I guide you through a complete body scan to help\cb3 \ \cb1 you release all tight muscles both conscious and unconscious as you listen\cb3 \ \cb1 simply allow your attention to move to the area's you hear mentioned\cb3 \ \cb1 consciously inviting release and relaxation to each of these parts so\cb3 \ \cb1 let's begin by taking three full breaths while holding awareness of your body as\cb3 \ \cb1 a whole there is no need to actively change anything right now just simply\cb3 \ \cb1 observe\cb3 \ \cb1 now draw your attention to your left toes feeling into them with just your\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness as we move through this\cb3 \ \cb1 exercise try to refrain from moving sing\cb3 \ \cb1 if you can witness each area while maintaining complete stillness so\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing into your left toes noticing their presence and then on your next\cb3 \ \cb1 exhalation release any and all tension that resides there completely allowing\cb3 \ \cb1 them to be entirely free within this moment of stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 witness and release all tension in your left foot now inhaling and exhaling as\cb3 \ \cb1 you observe this area of the body\cb3 \ \cb1 move up to the ankle breathing into this space and then exhaling softening\cb3 \ \cb1 completely\cb3 \ \cb1 witness and release the lower left leg\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing in and out of the left knee area\cb3 \ \cb1 and the upper left leg\cb3 \ \cb1 so hold the entire left leg in your awareness now inhaling nourishment into\cb3 \ \cb1 this area of the body and exhaling or stress tension and unease\cb3 \ \cb1 now draw your awareness to the right toes inhaling deeply and then releasing\cb3 \ \cb1 them on the next exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 and continue in the same way as you observe the right foot\cb3 \ \cb1 the right ankle\cb3 \ \cb1 the lower right leg\cb3 \ \cb1 the knee\cb3 \ \cb1 and the upper right leg\cb3 \ \cb1 and take a moment now to hold your entire right leg in your awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 welcoming deep release on the inhalation and inviting it to let go completely\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 bring your awareness now to your pelvis breathing down to your pelvis and\cb3 \ \cb1 release and your hips\cb3 \ \cb1 and to the buttocks\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing each of these areas to sink deeply into the surface beneath you as\cb3 \ \cb1 you come to fully relax each part\cb3 \ \cb1 witness and release your belly\cb3 \ \cb1 the lower back\cb3 \ \cb1 and then gently draw your awareness up to the spine consciously relaxing the\cb3 \ \cb1 muscles all around your vertebrae as you draw your awareness upwards\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale deeply into the full capacity of the lungs and then exhale slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing your chest to completely relax\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to observe the sounds around you allowing the distant rain to wash\cb3 \ \cb1 your physical body clean of all stressors and thoughts that may have\cb3 \ \cb1 been unconsciously lodged away\cb3 \ \cb1 witness and relax your left fingers now\cb3 \ \cb1 into your left hand\cb3 \ \cb1 your left wrist\cb3 \ \cb1 and lower left arm\cb3 \ \cb1 observe and then release a tightness or contraction in the elbow\cb3 \ \cb1 and the upper left arm and moving slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 until finally reaching the left shoulder\cb3 \ \cb1 just hold your entire left arm in your awareness as you let go of all\cb3 \ \cb1 discomfort and tension stored in this area of the body\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your awareness now to the right fingertips\cb3 \ \cb1 and to the right hand\cb3 \ \cb1 release or discomfort in the right wrist\cb3 \ \cb1 and breathing into the lower right arm\cb3 \ \cb1 the elbow\cb3 \ \cb1 and the upper right arm\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing deeply and then exhale allowing the shoulders to soften as well\cb3 \ \cb1 just witness and release the entire right arm now\cb3 \ \cb1 now observe the neck area letting go of anything stored in the throat region so\cb3 \ \cb1 to fully relax this area take a deep inhalation and as you exhale release a\cb3 \ \cb1 deep sigh through your escaping breath and notice the way the rest of the body\cb3 \ \cb1 is reminded to soften as you do this\cb3 \ \cb1 relax your jaw\cb3 \ \cb1 the cheeks\cb3 \ \cb1 and the nose\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your attention now to all the small muscles around your eyes and forward\cb3 \ \cb1 consciously inviting them to let go of all stress they may be carrying\cb3 \ \cb1 observe and relax the top of your head inviting all thoughts to dissolve as you\cb3 \ \cb1 become more and more tuned into the simplicity of the present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 and finally hold your entire body in your awareness catch the mind when it\cb3 \ \cb1 attempts to search for something prove something or chase something just accept\cb3 \ \cb1 this present moment experience - the way it is reminding yourself that there is\cb3 \ \cb1 nothing to do nothing to prove and nothing you need to be you are already\cb3 \ \cb1 enough right here right now\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few more minutes to breathe into the fullness of your body imagine your breath reaching all the way\cb3 \ \cb1 down to the tips of each limb follow\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath all the way there watching and nourishing the entire body as it\cb3 \ \cb1 moves through every inch of your being so take a moment now to let everything\cb3 \ \cb1 melt away as you tune into the sound of the rain falling all around you open\cb3 \ \cb1 your ears fully as the rain cleanses your body mind and heart\cb3 \ \cb1 if you notice your thoughts wandering at any point simply observe this wandering\cb3 \ \cb1 as a tendency of the mind without attaching yourself to the ideas or\cb3 \ \cb1 stories it is drifting too it is easy to\cb3 \ \cb1 become swept away by the current of the mind but as we practice gently releasing\cb3 \ \cb1 these thoughts streams we find that we become more like the rock bed beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 the stream still solid and deeply rooted\cb3 \ \cb1 to the present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 now open your awareness more intently to the sounds around you once again rain\cb3 \ \cb1 continues to fall washing away or thoughts and stories that no longer\cb3 \ \cb1 serve you\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment now to imagine yourself lying in a safe space that is open to\cb3 \ \cb1 the elements witness yourself resting\cb3 \ \cb1 peacefully here perhaps directly on the earth or perhaps supported by blankets\cb3 \ \cb1 or cushions observe the area around you\cb3 \ \cb1 someplace with lush greenery bright blossoms that have been nourished by the\cb3 \ \cb1 falling rains\cb3 \ \cb1 witness the way the rain falls upon your body nurturing you much the same way\cb3 \ \cb1 that it supports and nourishes the plant life around you as the rain falls down\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin to grow out of an older version of you out of older stories out\cb3 \ \cb1 of old attachments and out of any confinements imposed on you by the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin to blossom\cb3 \ \cb1 the rain is warm against your skin comforting you as it gently Falls take a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment to simply observe yourself here in this moment witnessing your entire\cb3 \ \cb1 being resting completely at peace beneath the softness of rain that trickles down\cb3 \ \cb1 as thoughts arise within the mind observe them as the energy bodies that\cb3 \ \cb1 do not belong to you and then practice raising them ever so slightly so that\cb3 \ \cb1 they come to rest on the surface of your skin somewhere along your forehead and\cb3 \ \cb1 as the rain trickles down what should carry these thoughts away with it\cb3 \ \cb1 gliding effortlessly away from your body and down down down into the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 the earth and rain paired together are a powerful tool of transformation the\cb3 \ \cb1 earth helps to ground to hold energies freeing up space for new life to be born\cb3 \ \cb1 while the rain helps to improve flow in the physical world\cb3 \ \cb1 water continues to trickle down from the expansive sky taking in and releasing\cb3 \ \cb1 all old thoughts stories and beliefs that might continue to arise breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 through an open heart as you allow whatever arises to be cleansed\cb3 \ \cb1 if fearful worried or judgmental thoughts arise about this process of\cb3 \ \cb1 release or about your intent to let go simply observe these thoughts as their\cb3 \ \cb1 own life forms too and remind yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 that they are separate from who you really are\cb3 \ \cb1 they do not belong to you and they no\cb3 \ \cb1 longer serve you just open your heart to\cb3 \ \cb1 freedom to release and personal growth\cb3 \ \cb1 compassionately inviting the old to be returned to the earth for processing and\cb3 \ \cb1 renewal\cb3 \ \cb1 if physical tension or discomfort arises within the body observe that too and\cb3 \ \cb1 then gently guide the tense energy towards the surface of the body as the\cb3 \ \cb1 rain trickles down witness it carrying away any and/or discomfort that may have\cb3 \ \cb1 been lodged away in the muscles and cells there is no need to carry this\cb3 \ \cb1 tension any longer\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to ground yourself through the sound of the falling rain allowing it to\cb3 \ \cb1 be your anchor into the present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 while keeping the breath deep draw your awareness to the heart space filling it\cb3 \ \cb1 with love and ease on each inhalation and freeing it of all tension stress and\cb3 \ \cb1 concern on each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 through your exhalations offer up all remaining tension to be cleansed by the\cb3 \ \cb1 rain perhaps sighing deeply as you feel into this process of letting go\cb3 \ \cb1 your entire being may now be much lighter and at once was your heart rate\cb3 \ \cb1 has slowed and your breathing has taken on a deep and steady rhythm just allow\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath to rock you gently as the rain continues to trickle down\cb3 \ \cb1 though the rain continues it finds less and less stress and discomfort needing\cb3 \ \cb1 to be cleansed away you are now moving towards a state of deep peace and\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation completely free of everything\cb3 \ \cb1 that once weighed you down\cb3 \ \cb1 now gently let go of any remaining visuals in your mind's eye allowing the\cb3 \ \cb1 image of you being bathed by the rain to slowly melt away in its place with eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 remaining closed tuned into the space around you once again\cb3 \ \cb1 observe the feel of the surfaces beneath you and around you\cb3 \ \cb1 and then connect to the air as it brushes against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 and as it fills your lungs\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe slowly and deeply as you continue to hold your awareness on\cb3 \ \cb1 this state of complete ease and relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing left for you to do to open your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 and surrender your mind to a deep and restorative sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 very soon your mindful awareness will melt away\cb3 \ \cb1 into a deep and peaceful slumber till then\cb3

inner forest journey where you will encounter various creatures along the\cb3 \ \cb1 way that will guide you further along the path towards release peace and\cb3 \ \cb1 tranquillity all that is required of you is your innate capacity for openness so\cb3 \ \cb1 gently allow the body and mind to soften as we begin this journey before you\cb3 \ \cb1 release yourself from what's being carried on throughout today just take a moment now to get comfortable adjust\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself as necessary you might want to use further cushions or blankets or get\cb3 \ \cb1 your pillow exactly as you would

body to revel in the physical world around you taking pause here to give\cb3 \ \cb1 gratitude to this very moment where you find yourself currently in so I invite\cb3 \ \cb1 you now to bring your

natural rhythm watching it naturally deepen as you draw\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention to it there is no breathing technique required\cb3 \ \cb1 here only an honest and open witnessing\cb3 \ \cb1 as you watch the breath allow any thoughts or judgments to fall away it is\cb3 \ \cb1 not necessary for anything within your experience to look or feel a certain way\cb3 \ \cb1 simply begin to open your heart to the simplicity and perfection of this very\cb3 \ \cb1 moment allowing yourself to be exactly as you are right now also keep in mind\cb3 \ \cb1 that with the all meditations you are always in control the power to visualize\cb3 \ \cb1 to manifest and to embody is yours and yours alone so allow now the energy of\cb3 \ \cb1 the forest to simply guide you into deeper knowings that already exists within you know that\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever sensations feelings or thoughts that may arise are entirely natural\cb3 \ \cb1 you simply witness them before allowing them to pass drawing yourself further\cb3 \ \cb1 into the enchanted forest you are about to discover\cb3 \ \cb1 so just take a few more fully aware breaths preparing the body for deep rest\cb3 \ \cb1 and relief of all stress tension and anxiety\cb3 \ \cb1 as the mind and body softens further into a state of tranquility slowly allow\cb3 \ \cb1 visions of a dense forest to grow within your mind's eye at the foot of this\cb3 \ \cb1 dream the richness of complex soil systems form the ground beneath you and\cb3 \ \cb1 out of this magical earth sprouts elaborate greenery trees shrubs flowers\cb3 \ \cb1 and vines allow the wildness of this\cb3 \ \cb1 forest to grow and then eventually steady out drawing you into the lush\cb3 \ \cb1 beauty and complete stillness of the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few deep breaths here allowing the forest air to fill the entirety of\cb3 \ \cb1 your lungs [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 with each inhalation notice yourself becoming infused with nature's healing\cb3 \ \cb1 powers and with each breath out witness\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself releasing some sensations of stress or tension into the healing air\cb3 \ \cb1 around you binding yourself now standing\cb3 \ \cb1 or sitting within an opening in these woods continue to take slow and deep\cb3 \ \cb1 breaths here allowing yourself to be in the majesty of the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 you are entirely safe and supported within these woods knowing that nothing\cb3 \ \cb1 here can harm you you open yourself up quite naturally to the messages that\cb3 \ \cb1 come your way\cb3 \ \cb1 in the stillness of this moment this deep forest within you hear a gentle\cb3 \ \cb1 stirring in the dense woods before you slowly and with grace a deer emerges\cb3 \ \cb1 into the opening you resting she is gentle and soft footed presenting no\cb3 \ \cb1 threat to your well-being the two of you\cb3 \ \cb1 watch one another with an incredible openness that permeates the core your\cb3 \ \cb1 being rehearsed soft movements you begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to see that she is here to bestow her wisdom upon you the gift of softness\cb3 \ \cb1 kindness and grace\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] this deer grants you the ability to\cb3 \ \cb1 harness your intuitive capabilities\cb3 \ \cb1 within this reawakening of intuition you\cb3 \ \cb1 know it is a safe place to gently release the entanglements of the mind that may be fogging over your clearest\cb3 \ \cb1 visions you might like to take a few\cb3 \ \cb1 deep breaths here allowing the mind to be released on each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 the deer departs lowly and you were left with her softness and the trace of her\cb3 \ \cb1 silent footing you begin to breathe more deeply and the mind begins to loosen its\cb3 \ \cb1 grasp all of the breath here for a few moments allowing it to carry you deep\cb3 \ \cb1 into the richness of this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 with each inhalation you are nourished and with each exhalation you are freed\cb3 \ \cb1 from the confines of the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 you rest once more in the peaceful opening of the woods this time an animal\cb3 \ \cb1 makes itself seen not from its footing on the earth floor but rather as it\cb3 \ \cb1 soars above the dense canopy the eagle flies overhead with strength courage and\cb3 \ \cb1 clear-sightedness you watch in awe as it\cb3 \ \cb1 flies between earth and the cosmos as if it were the king of this forest or the\cb3 \ \cb1 king of the open air the Eagle comes as\cb3 \ \cb1 a messenger to reveal a human connection to the divine by way of its appearance\cb3 \ \cb1 here it bestows upon you the gift of power of healing and of wisdom\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin to feel divinely connected to the forest to these animals and to the\cb3 \ \cb1 energy that swirls around you to spirit or to the universe\cb3 \ \cb1 knowing that you are supported by something higher than yourself you begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to release further into this present moment stress or anxiety carried in the\cb3 \ \cb1 body or mind continue to melt away you\cb3 \ \cb1 come the sense that within the grand scheme of the universe the tension that\cb3 \ \cb1 you carry no longer serves you you release it gently into the air with each\cb3 \ \cb1 out breath\cb3 \ \cb1 as the eagle slowly disappears from sight you are left with an awareness of\cb3 \ \cb1 this magical connection between body mind and spirit\cb3 \ \cb1 so in this moment continue to breathe mindfully you draw yourself again and\cb3 \ \cb1 again breath by breath into this present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment within the space of this forest you\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe in the healing air releasing that which no longer serves\cb3 \ \cb1 you to the woods to be transformed you find yourself resting more comfortably\cb3 \ \cb1 and with greater ease in this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 your connection to the forest is deepening as you become more settled within its environment you feel inspired\cb3 \ \cb1 by the animals and greenery that nourishes you here and you are fully\cb3 \ \cb1 open to whatever may come knowing that nothing can harm you in any way\cb3 \ \cb1 just before you an agile Lynx emerges from the woods she's quiet and\cb3 \ \cb1 contemplative and she watches you with knowing eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 the Lynx has incredible insights and strong intuition his highly instinctive\cb3 \ \cb1 encourages you to trust your own instincts in the same way she bears the\cb3 \ \cb1 gift of solitude of patience and of caution the Lynx remind you that there\cb3 \ \cb1 is nothing to be done in this instant all that she asks is for you to pay\cb3 \ \cb1 attention with discernment slowly your\cb3 \ \cb1 path unfolds itself with her grace you'll gently be guided along the way or\cb3 \ \cb1 that you are required to do now in this moment is to relax and listen\cb3 \ \cb1 as she disappears into the density of the forest the Lynx leaves you in\cb3 \ \cb1 solitude the air is quiet now and you\cb3 \ \cb1 are beginning to revel in the stillness and silence that is within you as you\cb3 \ \cb1 tune in now gently following your breath you come into contact with the joy and\cb3 \ \cb1 freedom within this very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 as you gently follow your breath you come into contact with this very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 what emotions do you feel here you might\cb3 \ \cb1 feel joy you might feel sadness you might not\cb3 \ \cb1 feel anything and this is all perfectly okay at this moment just allow the\cb3 \ \cb1 outside world to melt away as you\cb3 \ \cb1 experience a deeper sense of peace within sink into this moment a little\cb3 \ \cb1 bit further using your breath to\cb3 \ \cb1 continually ground you in this present moment remind yourself that with each\cb3 \ \cb1 inhalation you are deeply nourished and with each exhalation you softly\cb3 \ \cb1 unnaturally release any stress or tension\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as the light begins to fall away behind the trees a calming energy comes over\cb3 \ \cb1 the forest within the center of it you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel yourself to be quiet at home connected deeply with everything that it\cb3 \ \cb1 holds\cb3 \ \cb1 before the light fades away you catch sight of something moving delicately and\cb3 \ \cb1 gently through the air above the most vibrant butterfly you of ever witnessed\cb3 \ \cb1 litters there is dancing peacefully and radiantly through the air around her a\cb3 \ \cb1 complete embodiment of her own radiance she carries the message of joy lightness\cb3 \ \cb1 and transformation\cb3 \ \cb1 the butterfly is not always been this way before opening her wings she spent a\cb3 \ \cb1 period of time within a hardened shell during this period of non movement she\cb3 \ \cb1 transformed bringing her to a place where she is now littering through the\cb3 \ \cb1 lush forest very much alive\cb3 \ \cb1 as the night falls the butterfly leaves you with the feeling of inspiration and\cb3 \ \cb1 a growing faith in the unfolding journey held within the innate wisdom of this\cb3 \ \cb1 ever-changing journey you soften ever more deeply into the unknown see if you\cb3 \ \cb1 can allow all stress and tension to melt away just trusting in this moment a\cb3 \ \cb1 natural flow of the universe\cb3 \ \cb1 light turns to darkness and still you stay there within this forest you are at\cb3 \ \cb1 peace here Elden nourished by the free air around you as you breathe you begin to release\cb3 \ \cb1 any tension that might be still tucked away within this body now lying\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortably on the forest floor you scan the body gently allowing any sensation\cb3 \ \cb1 of discomfort to naturally dissipate\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can witness all of your stress and anxiety melting away into the\cb3 \ \cb1 ground beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 you are at one at peace in this moment with the natural\cb3 \ \cb1 flow of the world around you\cb3 \ \cb1 Eldar nourished within the opening of the forest you are gently rocked to\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep the wind caresses your skin and\cb3 \ \cb1 continues to breathe itself through you the air is warm on this summer night and\cb3 \ \cb1 your body is completely at ease you\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the faintest sounds of the forest as they lull you to sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 before fading into a peaceful slumber you hear a wolf howling in the distance\cb3 \ \cb1 there is no fear within you at hearing this sound rather you feel a divine\cb3 \ \cb1 connection to this Wolf's voice you know deep down that this wolf will not harm\cb3 \ \cb1 you and that it is here to guide you\cb3 \ \cb1 his sound calls to you to remind you that you were divinely connected and\cb3 \ \cb1 supported he is a symbol of guardianship\cb3 \ \cb1 loyalty and courage highly instinctive\cb3 \ \cb1 creatures woofs rely on their own inner knowing and this too is the gift they provide\cb3 \ \cb1 you the wolf's voice appears now to\cb3 \ \cb1 remind you to trust your own inner workings to follow your heart and trust\cb3 \ \cb1 your gut is how radiates through your being as\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin to embody greater courage trust and strength unfolding subtly\cb3 \ \cb1 moment to moment breath by breath\cb3 \ \cb1 embodying this wisdom you allow yourself to sink all the way into this present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment you release every ounce of stress\cb3 \ \cb1 and tension allowing the wisdom of your body to carry you into a deeply healing\cb3 \ \cb1 and restorative sleep you know\cb3 \ \cb1 intuitively that there is nothing to be done in this moment and nothing to be\cb3 \ \cb1 achieved continue to follow the breath you sink deeper and deeper into this\cb3 \ \cb1 body nothing else matters nothing else\cb3 \ \cb1 pulls you in any direction the breath gently carries you into sleep as your\cb3 \ \cb1 mind drifts away you are at peace\cb3 \ \cb1 beginning to take comfort in your

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello my name is Jason Stephenson and\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome to this guided meditation that\cb3 \ \cb1 will help you to visualize your highest\cb3 \ \cb1 self as well as the dreams and goals of\cb3 \ \cb1 your highest intent as you listen to\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation each night over the\cb3 \ \cb1 course of the next 28 days profound\cb3 \ \cb1 inner shifts and changes will take place\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation holds the power to\cb3 \ \cb1 change your life helping you to\cb3 \ \cb1 establish new ideas and beliefs about\cb3 \ \cb1 who you really are so I invite you to\cb3 \ \cb1 open your heart to this journey as you\cb3 \ \cb1 move down the path towards your highest\cb3 \ \cb1 self before we begin I invite you to\cb3 \ \cb1 silence all device notifications and set\cb3 \ \cb1 any morning alarms that are required\cb3 \ \cb1 ensure that the blinds are drawn and\cb3 \ \cb1 that all other end of day activities are\cb3 \ \cb1 taken care of and bring yourself into a\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable lying down position and\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your entire body to just let go\cb3 \ \cb1 and sink into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 you might like to make any final\cb3 \ \cb1 movements or adjustments necessary to\cb3 \ \cb1 bring complete comfort to your physical\cb3 \ \cb1 body take a few deep breaths in and out\cb3 \ \cb1 as you settled into this space I invite\cb3 \ \cb1 you now to quietly explore the silent\cb3 \ \cb1 space within by drawing your awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 to your breathing follow its movement\cb3 \ \cb1 into the body and then back out\cb3 \ \cb1 as habitual thoughts begin to loosen\cb3 \ \cb1 their grip just follow the simplicity of\cb3 \ \cb1 the breathing this energetic life force\cb3 \ \cb1 that functions continuously without your\cb3 \ \cb1 need to control it\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing you need to consciously\cb3 \ \cb1 do in order to breathe it is a force\cb3 \ \cb1 that effortlessly guides itself by\cb3 \ \cb1 drawing our attention to it we begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 refocus the mind on the present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 using the breath as an anchor to draw us\cb3 \ \cb1 into the ever unfolding reality of right\cb3 \ \cb1 now\cb3 \ \cb1 expand now your field of awareness by\cb3 \ \cb1 observing your connection to the\cb3 \ \cb1 physical world beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 witness the entire body being warmly\cb3 \ \cb1 held by the earth as you rest here in\cb3 \ \cb1 complete stillness as night falls the\cb3 \ \cb1 earth offers us a chance to release\cb3 \ \cb1 everything the day has required of us\cb3 \ \cb1 inviting us to sink into a period of\cb3 \ \cb1 restoration and rejuvenation\cb3 \ \cb1 as you become aware of the environment\cb3 \ \cb1 through your sense of touch you begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 feel more deeply rooted and connected to\cb3 \ \cb1 this human life allow yourself this\cb3 \ \cb1 moment of peace by feeling into the\cb3 \ \cb1 blessing and benefits of the Setting Sun\cb3 \ \cb1 and the stillness and stability of the\cb3 \ \cb1 earth beneath you in this very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the moment we are born into this human\cb3 \ \cb1 form we begin to accumulate ideas about\cb3 \ \cb1 who we are and what we are capable of\cb3 \ \cb1 these ideas turn into beliefs which turn\cb3 \ \cb1 into actions that create our reality\cb3 \ \cb1 however the truth of the matter is that\cb3 \ \cb1 we are not whatever our thoughts have\cb3 \ \cb1 limited us to be when we start to\cb3 \ \cb1 unravel a complex web of stories we have\cb3 \ \cb1 told ourselves again and again we free\cb3 \ \cb1 up space for our truest and highest self\cb3 \ \cb1 to shine through\cb3 \ \cb1 if the mind attempts to analyze or\cb3 \ \cb1 rationalize your stories I invite you to\cb3 \ \cb1 gently let go of this mental action\cb3 \ \cb1 as you move into the heart space old\cb3 \ \cb1 beliefs will naturally begin to unravel\cb3 \ \cb1 themselves exposing what exists deep\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath the surface of who you think you\cb3 \ \cb1 are so draw your breath into the heart\cb3 \ \cb1 now each time limiting thoughts arise\cb3 \ \cb1 about who you are where you have been or\cb3 \ \cb1 where you are going\cb3 \ \cb1 gently guide these notions down to the\cb3 \ \cb1 heart to be transformed as you witness\cb3 \ \cb1 them arising silently repeat these\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts I see you and I release you I\cb3 \ \cb1 see you and I release you I see you and\cb3 \ \cb1 I release you\cb3 \ \cb1 each time you release preconceived\cb3 \ \cb1 notions about who you are you free up\cb3 \ \cb1 empty space for new life to emerge from\cb3 \ \cb1 without seeding any new ideas just yet\cb3 \ \cb1 take some time to simply revel in the\cb3 \ \cb1 silence and the emptiness of the world\cb3 \ \cb1 within and it's a soothing emptiness\cb3 \ \cb1 that grows more apparent as each\cb3 \ \cb1 limiting notion of who you are\cb3 \ \cb1 untangles itself from your core\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your awareness to your stomach\cb3 \ \cb1 noticing the way the breath causes your\cb3 \ \cb1 belly to rise and to fall on the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 out alongside each full breath cycle\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to ground yourself in this\cb3 \ \cb1 moment through the breath allowing it to\cb3 \ \cb1 remind you of what is most real that is\cb3 \ \cb1 your direct experience of this present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment\cb3 \ \cb1 now as you breathe focus your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 on the following words helping you to\cb3 \ \cb1 deeply reaffirm the belief that you are\cb3 \ \cb1 far more than any limiting self notions\cb3 \ \cb1 and that you are capable of achieving\cb3 \ \cb1 your truest dreams and goals so\cb3 \ \cb1 alongside each breath silently whisper\cb3 \ \cb1 to yourself I create my life from within\cb3 \ \cb1 I create my life\cb3 \ \cb1 from within I create my life from within\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments of silence now to\cb3 \ \cb1 sink deeply into the truth of these\cb3 \ \cb1 words repeating them softly and slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to notice your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 becoming more relaxed and then draw your\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness to your toes\cb3 \ \cb1 very slowly begin to carry your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention upwards throughout the body\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you pass each area of your\cb3 \ \cb1 physical being observe any areas where\cb3 \ \cb1 they may be lingering tension or\cb3 \ \cb1 tightness and silently whisper I see you\cb3 \ \cb1 and I release you to each area that\cb3 \ \cb1 requires your loving attention\cb3 \ \cb1 once you have reached the top of your\cb3 \ \cb1 head bring the entire physical body into\cb3 \ \cb1 your awareness the mind included once\cb3 \ \cb1 again quietly compassionately and\cb3 \ \cb1 non-judgmentally repeat these words I\cb3 \ \cb1 see you and I release you I see you and\cb3 \ \cb1 I release you I see you and I release\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 a deep sense of lightness and freedom\cb3 \ \cb1 will begin to overcome you just take a\cb3 \ \cb1 few deep breaths into this sensation\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing it to run through your entire\cb3 \ \cb1 being\cb3 \ \cb1 now with your highest self quietly\cb3 \ \cb1 radiating outwards I invite you to begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to consider what new version of yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 is waiting to emerge what dreams or\cb3 \ \cb1 goals are ready to be brought to\cb3 \ \cb1 fruition\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments of silence here as\cb3 \ \cb1 you allow images and dreams to come to\cb3 \ \cb1 you there is no need to actively seek\cb3 \ \cb1 anything out there is also no right or\cb3 \ \cb1 wrong ideas that might come to the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface simply allow your heart to speak\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing its purest and highest intent\cb3 \ \cb1 to come to your awareness through words\cb3 \ \cb1 and images observe them as they arise\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 also becoming aware of any attempt the\cb3 \ \cb1 mind might make to intervene refrain\cb3 \ \cb1 from making plans from assessing\cb3 \ \cb1 plausibility from arguing or judging\cb3 \ \cb1 what arises just allow yourself to\cb3 \ \cb1 unconditionally explore whatever comes\cb3 \ \cb1 up for you\cb3 \ \cb1 now begin to visualize yourself in a\cb3 \ \cb1 small stretch of open space in the\cb3 \ \cb1 middle of a forest observe the wildlife\cb3 \ \cb1 that flourishes around you observe the\cb3 \ \cb1 colors the textures the sounds and the\cb3 \ \cb1 aromas open all of your senses to this\cb3 \ \cb1 space feeling into the wild freedom of\cb3 \ \cb1 this natural landscape\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 standing firmly rooted into the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 you reach into your pocket and pull out\cb3 \ \cb1 three seeds just take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 observe these seeds noting how\cb3 \ \cb1 miraculous seeds really are these tiny\cb3 \ \cb1 nuggets of material hold the power and\cb3 \ \cb1 incredible potential to transform into\cb3 \ \cb1 something completely different than what\cb3 \ \cb1 they might appear to be in their present\cb3 \ \cb1 form and you too have seeds inside of\cb3 \ \cb1 you that are waiting to be planted so\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to bring to mind three\cb3 \ \cb1 intentions of your highest self of your\cb3 \ \cb1 purest heart\cb3 \ \cb1 consider the words and images that came\cb3 \ \cb1 to you in the silent and spacious void\cb3 \ \cb1 created after limiting thoughts and\cb3 \ \cb1 beliefs had been released\cb3 \ \cb1 what are your highest goals who are you\cb3 \ \cb1 ready to become\cb3 \ \cb1 now with the first intention in mind\cb3 \ \cb1 silently whisper your vision to one of\cb3 \ \cb1 your seeds take a moment to thoughtfully\cb3 \ \cb1 plant this intention into the seed and\cb3 \ \cb1 then as you bend down dig a small hole\cb3 \ \cb1 with your bare hands\cb3 \ \cb1 once you have prepared the soil for your\cb3 \ \cb1 first seed place the seed in the space\cb3 \ \cb1 created and gently cover it up with the\cb3 \ \cb1 fertile earth take a moment to bless\cb3 \ \cb1 this seed offering it the energy it\cb3 \ \cb1 needs to blossom into full potential and\cb3 \ \cb1 then come to rest in silence once again\cb3 \ \cb1 in this opening in the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your second intention to mind and\cb3 \ \cb1 bestow it upon your second seed\cb3 \ \cb1 crouching down once again\cb3 \ \cb1 create a space in the earth for your\cb3 \ \cb1 seed to grow roots plant the seed and\cb3 \ \cb1 then cover it with soil offer this newly\cb3 \ \cb1 planted intention all of the love and\cb3 \ \cb1 support it will need to grow into\cb3 \ \cb1 fruition\cb3 \ \cb1 and then return to silent awareness of\cb3 \ \cb1 the enchanted forest you are Hin\cb3 \ \cb1 finally observe the third seed resting\cb3 \ \cb1 in the palm of your hand and whisper\cb3 \ \cb1 your third and final intention or dream\cb3 \ \cb1 to it\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe through the heart as you bless\cb3 \ \cb1 this seed with unconditional love and\cb3 \ \cb1 then as you did for the rest dig a small\cb3 \ \cb1 hole in the earth and then plant your\cb3 \ \cb1 seed as you cover the hole up with rich\cb3 \ \cb1 soil observe a lightness coming over\cb3 \ \cb1 your entire being your dreams have now\cb3 \ \cb1 been seeded so take a few final moments\cb3 \ \cb1 to send positive vibrations to the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 and the seeds that are planted there\cb3 \ \cb1 knowing that change is happening in this\cb3 \ \cb1 very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 witness the body relaxing and the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 deepening as a subtle transformation\cb3 \ \cb1 frees you of whatever once held you back\cb3 \ \cb1 now gently release the image of yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 in this fertile forest knowing that you\cb3 \ \cb1 will come back here again and again\cb3 \ \cb1 night after night to plant these\cb3 \ \cb1 energetic seeds of your highest\cb3 \ \cb1 intention\cb3 \ \cb1 keep these intentions in mind for\cb3 \ \cb1 replanting but also allow flexibility in\cb3 \ \cb1 your intentions as complex human beings\cb3 \ \cb1 we are multifaceted creatures with\cb3 \ \cb1 numerous ways of expressing ourselves\cb3 \ \cb1 and of living our lives the ways in\cb3 \ \cb1 which you can live wholeheartedly are\cb3 \ \cb1 boundless the possibilities are infinite\cb3 \ \cb1 return to your breath allowing its\cb3 \ \cb1 steady and subtle rhythm to carry you\cb3 \ \cb1 into a state of deep relaxation there is\cb3 \ \cb1 nothing left for you to do nothing for\cb3 \ \cb1 you to visualize so allow all thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 to melt away\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender your dreams to the world\cb3 \ \cb1 around you knowing that the universe has\cb3 \ \cb1 already heard your calls your highest\cb3 \ \cb1 self is in the making and as you come\cb3 \ \cb1 into sleep transformation will continue\cb3 \ \cb1 to unfold\cb3 \ \cb1 focus your attention on your breath as\cb3 \ \cb1 you fall asleep or you may alternatively\cb3 \ \cb1 choose to reaffirm the truth that the\cb3 \ \cb1 power to recreate yourself and your life\cb3 \ \cb1 exists inside of you quietly repeat I\cb3 \ \cb1 create my life from within I create my\cb3 \ \cb1 life from within I create my life from\cb3 \ \cb1 within surrender to the universes\cb3 \ \cb1 mysterious process and wisdom knowing\cb3 \ \cb1 that you are unconditionally supported\cb3 \ \cb1 loved and held in this very moment a new\cb3 \ \cb1 you is being birthed right now}

\cb1 breath all the way down to your\cb3 \ \cb1 diaphragm area holding for a few seconds\cb3 \ \cb1 and then letting it all come out release\cb3 \ \cb1 all your hair\cb3 \ \cb1 and do this another two times\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe a little deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 imagine now that you were standing in a\cb3 \ \cb1 grassy field tiny green plants sparkling\cb3 \ \cb1 with Jun cushioning your feet with their\cb3 \ \cb1 soft leaves and above you the sky is\cb3 \ \cb1 spotless blue and you can hear a few\cb3 \ \cb1 birds singing around you it is morning\cb3 \ \cb1 and it's the start of a beautiful day as\cb3 \ \cb1 you stand in this place allow yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 to truly feel all that is around you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the temperature of the air on any\cb3 \ \cb1 exposed skin the sunshine or wind\cb3 \ \cb1 against your body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take note of the smells damp soil dewy\cb3 \ \cb1 leaves\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 can you hear any birds possibly crickets\cb3 \ \cb1 or perhaps honeybees\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 gaze into the distance allowing your\cb3 \ \cb1 imagination to sharpen the scenery\cb3 \ \cb1 around you into an intensely detailed\cb3 \ \cb1 beautiful landscape and then when you\cb3 \ \cb1 are ready allow yourself to feel what it\cb3 \ \cb1 is like within your own body at this\cb3 \ \cb1 very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 where do your muscles and tendons hold\cb3 \ \cb1 pain or tension do you hold your face\cb3 \ \cb1 taut or your shoulders slumped\cb3 \ \cb1 I'd like you to take these few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 and truly notice how you feel\cb3 \ \cb1 treating yourself with kindness not not\cb3 \ \cb1 trying to change anything this is a\cb3 \ \cb1 snapshot of you\cb3 \ \cb1 a portrait captured in this moment just\cb3 \ \cb1 give yourself permission to become\cb3 \ \cb1 familiar with it\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and now as you become attune to your\cb3 \ \cb1 body allow your consciousness to turn to\cb3 \ \cb1 your mind as best as you are able\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing yourself to observe your brain\cb3 \ \cb1 its thought patterns and impulses\cb3 \ \cb1 without actively participating in them\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 it's almost like you are viewing a\cb3 \ \cb1 sporting match or a television show you\cb3 \ \cb1 can see what is happening you can point\cb3 \ \cb1 things out or cheer on certain thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 but you have no need to change or\cb3 \ \cb1 influence though at this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 you're simply watching the move past in\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever shapes or patterns they happen\cb3 \ \cb1 to take on\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if you find yourself getting sucked into\cb3 \ \cb1 a particular dilemma or worry simply\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale blow it out and bring your\cb3 \ \cb1 consciousness back to spectating\cb3 \ \cb1 observing\cb3 \ \cb1 as you observe your thoughts you will\cb3 \ \cb1 notice that certain hopes reminders and\cb3 \ \cb1 even worries continue to appear some may\cb3 \ \cb1 tempt you more than others some may be\cb3 \ \cb1 easier to let go of pay attention to the\cb3 \ \cb1 persistent ones and if they appear again\cb3 \ \cb1 ask yourself if these thoughts manifest\cb3 \ \cb1 themselves in your body you may notice\cb3 \ \cb1 anger in your chest or stress your hips\cb3 \ \cb1 but no matter how these emotions present\cb3 \ \cb1 themselves\cb3 \ \cb1 take heed oftentimes almost chronic pain\cb3 \ \cb1 is nothing more than a learned response\cb3 \ \cb1 to a series of emotions\cb3 \ \cb1 take these few moments now and simply\cb3 \ \cb1 stay with what you are feeling allowing\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to be conscious of the way it\cb3 \ \cb1 affects your mind and physical body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 when you were ready taking a deep breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 sighing out all the frustration tension\cb3 \ \cb1 and destructiveness within you do not be\cb3 \ \cb1 afraid to make a sound simply allow your\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale to wash it out of you\cb3 \ \cb1 cleansing your body in mind like a warm\cb3 \ \cb1 healing wave\cb3 \ \cb1 I'd like you to do this five more times\cb3 \ \cb1 noticing how you become progressively\cb3 \ \cb1 more relaxed increasingly more relieved\cb3 \ \cb1 with each passing moment feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself becoming present anchored in\cb3 \ \cb1 the gentle endless rhythm of your own\cb3 \ \cb1 respiration\cb3 \ \cb1 and now as you stand in this lush green\cb3 \ \cb1 field imagine that your feet are growing\cb3 \ \cb1 roots majestic powerful roots that grow\cb3 \ \cb1 into the soil holding you Ferland strong\cb3 \ \cb1 in this idyllic place see these roots\cb3 \ \cb1 going down\cb3 \ \cb1 as they reach further into the ground\cb3 \ \cb1 they split off forming a vast network of\cb3 \ \cb1 tendrils\cb3 \ \cb1 that will hold you firm in even the\cb3 \ \cb1 greatest weeds roots that will nourish\cb3 \ \cb1 and protect you through even the darkest\cb3 \ \cb1 winters and stronger storms\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 these roots extend hundreds of feet into\cb3 \ \cb1 the dirt growing around rocks and\cb3 \ \cb1 boulders passing through soil that has\cb3 \ \cb1 not seen the Sun for many centuries they\cb3 \ \cb1 cross the paths of other tree's roots\cb3 \ \cb1 touching them gently in greedy growing\cb3 \ \cb1 together yet respecting each trees\cb3 \ \cb1 individual space and root paths\cb3 \ \cb1 you are rooted in the most beautiful\cb3 \ \cb1 place your face turned toward the warm\cb3 \ \cb1 Sun and your roots nestled in cool rich\cb3 \ \cb1 soil and now as you take your next\cb3 \ \cb1 breath in imagine that your legs and\cb3 \ \cb1 torso are being wrapped gently in bark a\cb3 \ \cb1 soft form-fitting covering that will\cb3 \ \cb1 protect you from all the hazards that\cb3 \ \cb1 life has to offer you\cb3 \ \cb1 you know that you may return to your\cb3 \ \cb1 human form whenever you would like and\cb3 \ \cb1 so this is a soothing process almost as\cb3 \ \cb1 if you were being draped in the softest\cb3 \ \cb1 blanket imaginable\cb3 \ \cb1 you wiggle your toes peeling your roots\cb3 \ \cb1 bar below ground nestling into the dirt\cb3 \ \cb1 you shrug your shoulders feeling the\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable durability of bark all\cb3 \ \cb1 around you you have walked this earth\cb3 \ \cb1 for many years experiencing the joys and\cb3 \ \cb1 challenges that each day has to bring\cb3 \ \cb1 you you have earned your bark the golden\cb3 \ \cb1 cloak shot through with silver that\cb3 \ \cb1 warms you every day of your life\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe a little deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 and listen to the sounds of birds and\cb3 \ \cb1 nature all around you\cb3 \ \cb1 you stretch your arms out and as you do\cb3 \ \cb1 they fan into branches branches white\cb3 \ \cb1 with a spring whiteness of apple\cb3 \ \cb1 blossoms this time in your life is busy\cb3 \ \cb1 stressful even but in this space you are\cb3 \ \cb1 able to reach for the heavens\cb3 \ \cb1 celebrating the joy and space in every\cb3 \ \cb1 present moment as you inhale notice the\cb3 \ \cb1 delicate aroma of the small white\cb3 \ \cb1 flowers\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in the smell of sunshine and\cb3 \ \cb1 soil and growth\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you are ready turn your head to\cb3 \ \cb1 take in the sights all around you as you\cb3 \ \cb1 look around you realize that you are not\cb3 \ \cb1 standing in a field you are standing in\cb3 \ \cb1 an orchard a nearly endless community of\cb3 \ \cb1 trees right with the hopeful flowers of\cb3 \ \cb1 spring around your trunks long green\cb3 \ \cb1 grass grows a rock bright and in your\cb3 \ \cb1 branches bluebirds see you are not the\cb3 \ \cb1 only tree you are a part of a community\cb3 \ \cb1 a beautiful and vibrant orchard that\cb3 \ \cb1 grows together\cb3 \ \cb1 so often our lives feel as if they are\cb3 \ \cb1 only about us moments of pain and\cb3 \ \cb1 suffering of a distancing from that\cb3 \ \cb1 which matters most of us can be\cb3 \ \cb1 excruciating and yet even these\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations are a part of the rhythm of\cb3 \ \cb1 the seasons of the processes each of us\cb3 \ \cb1 undergoes many times throughout our\cb3 \ \cb1 lives\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 we each have periods of flowering of new\cb3 \ \cb1 leaves and possibilities for the future\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 we have the strong green growth of\cb3 \ \cb1 summer when small apples begin to appear\cb3 \ \cb1 between our bridges and our lives become\cb3 \ \cb1 glossy with gentle rains\cb3 \ \cb1 there is the abundance of fall when our\cb3 \ \cb1 plans and dreams become fruitful the air\cb3 \ \cb1 sweet with the crispness of ripe fruit\cb3 \ \cb1 but there are other times too there is\cb3 \ \cb1 the time when we drop our leaves letting\cb3 \ \cb1 our branches become bare falling into\cb3 \ \cb1 restful silent dormancy\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 there are the times when the orchard\cb3 \ \cb1 keeper comes pointing out to us the\cb3 \ \cb1 branches that have been withered or\cb3 \ \cb1 split the ones that no longer produce\cb3 \ \cb1 leaves or fruit there is the pain of\cb3 \ \cb1 losing these branches the loss of\cb3 \ \cb1 something that was once creative\cb3 \ \cb1 productive beloved\cb3 \ \cb1 but no matter how agonizing this is\cb3 \ \cb1 there is always that time when new\cb3 \ \cb1 shoots appear tiny branches that stand\cb3 \ \cb1 out electric green with life against our\cb3 \ \cb1 silvery gold trunks and so the cycle\cb3 \ \cb1 continues\cb3 \ \cb1 from flower to fruit to rest and back\cb3 \ \cb1 again\cb3 \ \cb1 and through it all we are rooted solid\cb3 \ \cb1 in our roots and our place in the\cb3 \ \cb1 orchard anchored against the coldest\cb3 \ \cb1 snows sharpest rains strongest gales\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 no matter what happens our roots hold us\cb3 \ \cb1 steady\cb3 \ \cb1 and our fellow trees brave the elements\cb3 \ \cb1 with us take a few minutes now and allow\cb3 \ \cb1 your body and mind to fully drink in the\cb3 \ \cb1 scene around you the beautiful white and\cb3 \ \cb1 gold expanse of the orchard you have\cb3 \ \cb1 been planted in smell the air be all the\cb3 \ \cb1 Sunshine's warm touch\cb3 \ \cb1 let the sounds of birds and animals\cb3 \ \cb1 guide you into a deeper relaxation the\cb3 \ \cb1 combination of wind and soil war and\cb3 \ \cb1 cold\cb3 \ \cb1 motion and stillness lull you into a\cb3 \ \cb1 total and complete serenity\cb3 \ \cb1 we will continue on together in a few\cb3 \ \cb1 minutes\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 this this right here in this very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 is the sensation of groundedness with\cb3 \ \cb1 each exhale you feel your body and mind\cb3 \ \cb1 relax a little more\cb3 \ \cb1 with every inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 you breathe in a clarity purpose and\cb3 \ \cb1 peace you are rooted and stable yet free\cb3 \ \cb1 able to reach to all the sky and sway in\cb3 \ \cb1 the breeze and perhaps most importantly\cb3 \ \cb1 you are surrounded by others others who\cb3 \ \cb1 love you and respect you\cb3 \ \cb1 and wish to help you you grow together\cb3 \ \cb1 each unique but journeying toward the\cb3 \ \cb1 same balanced peacefulness strong\cb3 \ \cb1 individually as a whole\cb3 \ \cb1 take these last few minutes of\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation to savor it\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and coming back now to the room we began\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 becoming aware of the cells in this room\cb3 \ \cb1 presently surrounding you\cb3 \ \cb1 beginning to wiggle your fingers and\cb3 \ \cb1 toes awakening your body returning to\cb3 \ \cb1 your body\cb3 \ \cb1 stretching out your muscles every muscle\cb3 \ \cb1 every tender\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you were ready\cb3 \ \cb1 you can open your eyes enjoy your day or\cb3 \ \cb1 evening ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Laughter]\cb3 \ \cb1 below and welcome my friends my name is Jason Stevenson and thank you for\cb3 \ \cb1 joining me on this sleep meditation golden stars astral heights meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation is unlike any other meditation I have previously done as\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation is being guided with the help of my guided spiritual adviser\cb3 \ \cb1 David [Music] so I asked you to find a comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 position lying down preferably with your\cb3 \ \cb1 back straight wriggling around finding yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 finding that space where you can lay comfortably and breathe with ease\cb3 \ \cb1 begin the meditation by taking in three deep breaths in through the nose sending\cb3 \ \cb1 that breath all the way down to the lower belly area and releasing letting\cb3 \ \cb1 go just do this a few more times\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you are done returning your breathing back to a comfortable rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 that is natural for you I need to try to change it just be with your breath enjoy\cb3 \ \cb1 the sensation of that breath as it passes through your nostrils sending it\cb3 \ \cb1 down and feeling it as it releases through your nostrils once more\cb3 \ \cb1 if at any time during this meditation your thoughts wander away from my voice\cb3 \ \cb1 you simply just have to acknowledge that thought and your job is simply to bring\cb3 \ \cb1 your focus back to your breathing in and out this meditation does not have to be\cb3 \ \cb1 complex in any way our job is simply to\cb3 \ \cb1 allow our mind to fall away to give it rest for the day whilst we allow our\cb3 \ \cb1 heart and spirit to open and surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] so for these next few moments simply\cb3 \ \cb1 being with your breath you may feel your\cb3 \ \cb1 stomach rising and falling maybe the sides of\cb3 \ \cb1 your belly rising and falling or your lower back area expanding on the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 in contracting on the breath out\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] really connect with your breathing just\cb3 \ \cb1 be here and enjoy this process and I will return in a few moments time\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I would like you now to visualize a golden light that is pouring in from the\cb3 \ \cb1 top of your head and it's beginning to fill you and pour all the way down your\cb3 \ \cb1 entire body it's a shining golden light and as it\cb3 \ \cb1 pours in it soothes you calms your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 and relaxes you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel it as it travels down your face\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxing your facial muscles your eyebrows your forward nose and cheeks\cb3 \ \cb1 and your eyes and eye sockets just allowing them to feel heavy and relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 down into your throat and your shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 and now filling your arms down to your elbows your forearms wrists and right\cb3 \ \cb1 down to your hands and fingertips\cb3 \ \cb1 you may even feel a tingling sensation within your fingers and if you do just\cb3 \ \cb1 allow that to be you don't have to judge that or try to name that just accept\cb3 \ \cb1 that as it is\cb3 \ \cb1 and coming back up your harms\cb3 \ \cb1 your shoulders and down now that the golden light continues to spill down to\cb3 \ \cb1 your chest area your stomach and your\cb3 \ \cb1 shoulder blades and your spine running down your spinal cord releasing all\cb3 \ \cb1 tension and allowing you to relax

your entire body now it's moving up and back\cb3 \ \cb1 up your feet your shins your calf muscles billing your body soothing your\cb3 \ \cb1 body relaxing your body getting ready for the most

learned today to forgive any\cb3 \ \cb1 grudges or resentments of health today to release them because just right now\cb3 \ \cb1 they don't serve you and we're here to\cb3 \ \cb1 serve you\cb3 \ \cb1

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this sleep meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 hypnosis over the course of the next few\cb3 \ \cb1 minutes we will journey through four different environments exploring peace\cb3 \ \cb1 and relaxation in the context of each one of them at the end you will have the\cb3 \ \cb1 freedom to select the right one for you attuning your spiritual surroundings to\cb3 \ \cb1 what you need for health healing and your happiness\cb3 \ \cb1 with this in mind allow a calm sense of expectation to rise in your mind and set\cb3 \ \cb1 an intention to rest deeply and completely feel your body relaxed more\cb3 \ \cb1 than it has in a long while all the tension in your body dissolving bit by\cb3 \ \cb1 bit let every muscle in your body relax\cb3 \ \cb1 even those in the place you normally hold tired this may be your forehead\cb3 \ \cb1 your lips or jaw the back of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 your shoulder blades your lower back\cb3 \ \cb1

your body let's begin our\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation so lying down keeping your\cb3 \ \cb1 back straight as much as you can feel your body becoming more serene you are\cb3 \ \cb1 still and peaceful in this breath and the next as you relax you begin to hear\cb3 \ \cb1 the crash of water in the distance\cb3 \ \cb1 as you sink a little deeper into relaxation it grows louder until you\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself are standing on the banks of an enormous waterfall\cb3 \ \cb1 it is morning and the sunlight catches the water as it falls creating thousands\cb3 \ \cb1 of tiny rainbows in the spray around the cliff\cb3 \ \cb1 the rumble of moving water is at once both soothing and awe-inspiring a\cb3 \ \cb1 symphony of Earth's very essence tumbling around you take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in this majesty\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as you look more closely at the\cb3 \ \cb1 waterfall bill the cool mist envelop your face leaving dewy droplets on your\cb3 \ \cb1 cheeks and Florida feel the vitality and\cb3 \ \cb1 power of this place all around you in the warmth of the cliff bases\cb3 \ \cb1 the gentle glow of the Sun the frothy\cb3 \ \cb1 water around the Falls notice yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 becoming karma beginning to let go of your worries and physical tension\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to breathe letting the rush of the water guide you\cb3 \ \cb1 into a deeper relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to feel the slow transitions from inhale to exhale and\cb3 \ \cb1 from exhale to inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 note the tiny delicate paws in the center of these transitions that space\cb3 \ \cb1 where inhalation ends but before exhalation begins\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe as deeply or as shallowly as comfortable for you your chest moving\cb3 \ \cb1 rhythmically and effortlessly as you sink a little deeper into relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 letting go of any worry or stress\cb3 \ \cb1 if at any time your mind wanders simply bring it gently back to your breath a\cb3 \ \cb1 calming gentle process of bringing air into your lungs feel any tension in your\cb3 \ \cb1 body lift away with every breath you take nothing can hurt you here\cb3 \ \cb1 enjoy these next few moments next to the waterfall letting your worries dissolve\cb3 \ \cb1 under the relentless rumble of fresh rainwater\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you notice the sounds of the meditation begin to change allow your\cb3 \ \cb1 imagination to follow your feelings to follow creating around you a magnificent\cb3 \ \cb1 sandy beach waves break in crystalline\cb3 \ \cb1 sprays and the call of seagulls eases your mind smell the sharp tang of salt\cb3 \ \cb1 and the warm dustiness of hot sand\cb3 \ \cb1 let your shoulders droop and your fora done crease\cb3 \ \cb1 in the background you can hear the wash of the ocean waves breaking on the beach\cb3 \ \cb1 you can watch the water if you like or close your imaginary eyes and simply\cb3 \ \cb1 dwell in the presence of your other senses breathe and listen let everything\cb3 \ \cb1 else go\cb3 \ \cb1 so much of meditation is the practice of letting go of accepting that you cannot\cb3 \ \cb1 control everything around you of welcoming in the infinite glorious\cb3 \ \cb1 possibilities and opportunities that are waiting for you letting go of your\cb3 \ \cb1 conscious discipline your task oriented nature is the gateway to relaxation so\cb3 \ \cb1 taking a breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 and exhale letting go of the need to\cb3 \ \cb1 control your experience just for a few\cb3 \ \cb1 minutes allow yourself to feel whatever arises letting go of everything negative\cb3 \ \cb1 and treasuring the beauty of this moment's experience\cb3 \ \cb1 as your body lets go of any tension your breath slows down and it may deepen just\cb3 \ \cb1 a slight bit simply follow its rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 listening to the quiet in and out of air in your lungs if you would like match\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath to the tempo of the sea nearby following the rise and fall of\cb3 \ \cb1 the waves behind whatever feels most\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable most relaxing and embrace it\cb3 \ \cb1 this is your chance to discover and choose whatever you need to rest\cb3 \ \cb1 most fully\cb3 \ \cb1 and again as the music and sounds of this meditation begin to change allow\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to be transported to the banks of a freshwater brook or river where\cb3 \ \cb1 fish jump and the sunlight glints on the wet rocks\cb3 \ \cb1 as you take a deep inhale you breathe in the burbling sound of water on stones\cb3 \ \cb1 and the gentle sigh of wind in the young tree boughs take another deep breath and\cb3 \ \cb1 then release it relishing the warmth of the air that leaves your body feel your\cb3 \ \cb1 feet sink into the soft grass of the riverbank and notice the bright green\cb3 \ \cb1 color of early spring if you would like\cb3 \ \cb1 you may dip your foot into the stream noticing the way the water washes over\cb3 \ \cb1 your toes cooling your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 you can hear a few honeybees buzzing about enjoying the landscape as much as\cb3 \ \cb1 you are you know that the bees will not harm you and so you can continue to\cb3 \ \cb1 enjoy the gentle harmony they make a soft sound that sets off the silver\cb3 \ \cb1 tinkling music of the creek\cb3 \ \cb1 a little way in front of you a butterfly flutters on the breeze dipping and\cb3 \ \cb1 soaring with the invisible current of the wind you hold out your hand and it\cb3 \ \cb1 floats closer to you landing on your skin with an almost imperceptible touch\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to lay down on the riverbanks feeling the way the grass\cb3 \ \cb1 molds around your body supporting your back and neck so you can relax more\cb3 \ \cb1 completely above you you can see a\cb3 \ \cb1 fluffy white cloud a clear blue sky\cb3 \ \cb1 all around you are the sounds of nature peaceful and rhythmic\cb3 \ \cb1 your thoughts disappeared replaced by this music of nature you can feel all\cb3 \ \cb1 the aches and pains in your body dissolve away as you sink a little deeper into the warm grass relaxed and\cb3 \ \cb1 at peace in this beautiful landscape give yourself permission to enjoy it\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe you feel yourself growing lighter more relaxed almost as if the\cb3 \ \cb1 stresses and tensions of the day are being washed away in the cheerful sound\cb3 \ \cb1 of the river\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in welcoming inspiration and peace breathe out\cb3 \ \cb1 exhaling worry and fear this is your\cb3 \ \cb1 time embrace it now in these next few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 and now as the music and sounds around you change one small breathe in and find\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself on the path of a majestic and ancient forest the trail through the\cb3 \ \cb1 forest is verdant lined with the carpet of the grass your feet sink into it's\cb3 \ \cb1 slightly brushing against the soft coolness of its surface birds sing in\cb3 \ \cb1 the trees a symphony of natural beauty\cb3 \ \cb1 some chirp back and forth others trill\cb3 \ \cb1 melodies into the wind a gentle breeze\cb3 \ \cb1 sways in the trees and the soft touch of its passing soothes your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 the sunshine is less bright here dappled and soft instead of its usual brash gold\cb3 \ \cb1 the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to\cb3 \ \cb1 and yet it is a soothing coolness filled\cb3 \ \cb1 with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you walk further and deeper into the forest the trees become larger their\cb3 \ \cb1 trunks wider and spaced further apart in\cb3 \ \cb1 the resulting space hangs a mantle of pearly fog floating a few feet above the\cb3 \ \cb1 ground as you walk your legs stir the\cb3 \ \cb1 fog and it swirls around you gauzy tendrils lazy soft against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 birdsong accompanies you along your journey lifting your spirit and soothing\cb3 \ \cb1 your body with its innocent sounds let\cb3 \ \cb1 your self marvel at the size of these trees as wide around as dining tables\cb3 \ \cb1 and almost taller than your eyes can see\cb3 \ \cb1 smell the dampness of believes and dirt underneath them nourishing and\cb3 \ \cb1 protecting their roots imagine how far\cb3 \ \cb1 these tree's roots must extend into the earth in order to remain sturdy and\cb3 \ \cb1 upright above all allow the nature's\cb3 \ \cb1 music to guide you into further relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe deeply watching the sunlight meander back and forth as the\cb3 \ \cb1 trees sway in the breeze bring your attention to yourself are you holding\cb3 \ \cb1 any tension or is there any pain in your body are you carrying or holding on to\cb3 \ \cb1 something in your back your neck or your\cb3 \ \cb1 shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 is there tension in your hips or perhaps the way you squeeze your eyelid shut how\cb3 \ \cb1 does it feel to be you right now\cb3 \ \cb1 you are still and tranquil United with this peaceful an ageless environment\cb3 \ \cb1 feel your body relaxing as you breathe a little deeper letting go of anything\cb3 \ \cb1 that might distract you let yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 focus completely on the beauty of the forest sense it feel what it's like\cb3 \ \cb1 welcoming the harmony and stillness that accompanies it\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your attention to travel across your body noticing how deeply your\cb3 \ \cb1 muscles and tendons have relaxed since\cb3 \ \cb1 now the space between your thoughts the\cb3 \ \cb1 ease with which your mind moves between thoughts never lingering too long on one\cb3 \ \cb1 subject you feel calm peaceful and\cb3 \ \cb1 daddy's now in this state of quiet peace\cb3 \ \cb1 as this meditation spoken part comes to an end allow your mind to return to that\cb3 \ \cb1 place savoring the beautiful details as you sink further into this state of\cb3 \ \cb1 happy equanimity let your breath guide you and enjoy the final moments of music\cb3 \ \cb1 as you drift off

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation that\cb3 \ \cb1 will help you to find peace and inner tranquility before you naturally fall\cb3 \ \cb1 into a deep and restorative sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 short while you'll be guided to relax the body and ease the mind before being\cb3 \ \cb1 led through a visual journey into a mystical cave of peace it's your time to\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to be carried away gently through this journey knowing that you\cb3 \ \cb1 are entirely supported in this present moment so take a moment now to ensure\cb3 \ \cb1 that all end of day activities have been wrapped up alarms should be set and\cb3 \ \cb1 liens drawn I invite you now to come\cb3 \ \cb1 into a comfortable lying down position ensuring that your body is resting with\cb3 \ \cb1 ease wherever you are you might want to use blankets or cushions to support you\cb3 \ \cb1 as you find comfort in the physical space you occupy [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few releasing breaths here allowing a deep sigh to leave your body\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next outward breath [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 to begin our journey into tranquility take a moment to observe the stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 of your physical body as dei transforms\cb3 \ \cb1 into night and the Sun fades away we are invited to enter a much needed period of\cb3 \ \cb1 rest and rejuvenation as we sink into the stillness of night rest assured\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing we need to consciously engage in or take care of we can trust\cb3 \ \cb1 that the body will work by its way of its innate wisdom so take a moment now\cb3 \ \cb1 to quietly observe the miracle of this body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] feel into its heaviness as you sink\cb3 \ \cb1 further into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 you might want to notice now where there might still be movement despite the\cb3 \ \cb1 sense of stillness notice where breath brings subtle\cb3 \ \cb1 movement to the body how it causes the chest and stomach to expand on each\cb3 \ \cb1 inhalation and to fall away on each\cb3 \ \cb1 exhalation [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 observe how beautifully this gentle movement intertwines with a deeper sense\cb3 \ \cb1 of complete stillness as you take a few deep breaths here in silence\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if thoughts arise in the mind no that is entirely natural for them to do so as\cb3 \ \cb1 you become aware that your attention has shifted into stories about the past or\cb3 \ \cb1 future simply acknowledge these thoughts from a more distant place than his habit\cb3 \ \cb1 or [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 while the mind can be useful at times it can lure us into a unproductive thought\cb3 \ \cb1 cycles when left to run on its own terms\cb3 \ \cb1 as we begin to witness our mental movements from a higher or broader\cb3 \ \cb1 vantage point we practice our power of discernment easing challenging thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 and emotions as we experience greater clarity and a sense of peace\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you journey through this meditation keep this sense of distance in mind as\cb3 \ \cb1 thought arises and returned to your breath as an anchor when needed\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 move now further into breath awareness as you practice holding your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 on this anchor that is always available to you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the breaths wither its pace and\cb3 \ \cb1 its depth as you move alongside it in both directions\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] hold for a brief pause just a second or\cb3 \ \cb1 two and at the end of each inhalation and each exhalation finding brief\cb3 \ \cb1 moments of complete stillness within each breath cycle\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the mind to gently subside as you become more attuned to the present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment attachment to worried anxious or\cb3 \ \cb1 distracting thoughts can be released as you practice being the observer of\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever is moving through you just\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to sink further and further into this very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 entering naturally into a state of full-bodied ease and tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 with your eyes remaining closed tune into this space between the eyebrows\cb3 \ \cb1 just in front of your mind's eye [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 envision in this space of vast emptiness something like a clear night sky\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] sink into this infinite abyss of space\cb3 \ \cb1 and silence for a few moments as you prepare to enter into a cave of complete\cb3 \ \cb1 peace and tranquility [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you gaze with eyes closed into the empty sky in front of you and vision\cb3 \ \cb1 your view dotted with infinite sparkling stars you are in an open outdoor space\cb3 \ \cb1 surrounded by the open air lakes rivers and mountains the moon is high and full\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 tune into your breath for a few moments noticing the freshness of the air that\cb3 \ \cb1 fills you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 just follow my voice for a few breaths here as you inhale deeply breathing in a\cb3 \ \cb1 sense of being completely at ease and exhale slowly releasing any tension or\cb3 \ \cb1 stress in body or mind inhaling again\cb3 \ \cb1 visualizing yourself filling up with peace and ease and exhale fully\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing anything that no longer serves your movement towards complete\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing deeply once more filling yourself with the freedom and freshness\cb3 \ \cb1 of outdoor air and exhale completely\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing all tension to be transformed by the starlit sky\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 returned gently to your natural breath allowing your mind to refocus on the\cb3 \ \cb1 empty space in front of your mind's eye [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 though night has fallen upon this outdoor landscape the land is lit by\cb3 \ \cb1 stars and moonlight granting you with\cb3 \ \cb1 enough light to see the curves of the earth take a moment now to simply\cb3 \ \cb1 observe the way the rocky mountain faced peaks and Falls and the way rivers and\cb3 \ \cb1 lakes gently caressed the hard surface of the earth notice how peaceful it is\cb3 \ \cb1 here beneath the night sky as you feel yourself coming into complete harmony\cb3 \ \cb1 with the natural world\cb3 \ \cb1 from where you stand you see an empty cavern not too far away illuminated by\cb3 \ \cb1 the full moon above its spaciousness its\cb3 \ \cb1 emptiness cause you towards it so you\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to walk slowly and mindfully towards the sheltered space within the\cb3 \ \cb1 mountain [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the way your feet effortlessly move across the earth you feel\cb3 \ \cb1 completely at home in this natural landscape as you move towards the cave\cb3 \ \cb1 that beckons you quietly [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you reach the opening to this wondrous cave your original sense that\cb3 \ \cb1 it rests unoccupied is confirmed there\cb3 \ \cb1 is no one here but you know plant life inside and no animals the only thing\cb3 \ \cb1 that you have yet to sense within this cave is a deep stillness it is\cb3 \ \cb1 completely silent and yet something about it is calling to you in the\cb3 \ \cb1 faintest whisper recognizable only by your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 by the entrance of the cave there is a candle placed here by some universal\cb3 \ \cb1 force for whoever might come to rest here you light the candle with a match\cb3 \ \cb1 that has also been provided and quietly make your way inside the dark cavern\cb3 \ \cb1 fear anxiety and worry are completely absent all that is present within you is\cb3 \ \cb1 a growing calmness [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 he reached the center of this mystical cave that has called you into it setting\cb3 \ \cb1 your candle in the center and bringing yourself to rest comfortably on the\cb3 \ \cb1 floor lying on your back you stare up at\cb3 \ \cb1 the ceiling noticing the incredible edges carved by nature breathing deeply\cb3 \ \cb1 and feel entirely at peace in this open and empty space\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 silence surrounds you as the mind rests in a deep state of peace and tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath continues to flow through you effortlessly and gracefully\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 yet within this vast silence something in this cave is speaking to you the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 cannot decipher it but the heart knows that there is a great wisdom radiating\cb3 \ \cb1 out from these walls you listen more intently to this language still foreign\cb3 \ \cb1 to the mind and find that your heart begins to open up the serenity of this\cb3 \ \cb1

heart remaining open you find that the walls speak back in silent\cb3 \ \cb1 whispers gently wisely and compassionately this is the language of\cb3 \ \cb1 the heart and you open yourself to it completely [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you do not have to search for any answers you trust that they will come in\cb3 \ \cb1 their own time patience and peace arise\cb3 \ \cb1 within you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the cave sends its wisdom in the form of whispers visions and inner sensations\cb3 \ \cb1 though not all at once this mystical cave knows that some\cb3 \ \cb1 answers require extra time to be revealed and that when the time is right\cb3 \ \cb1 the answers will be provided you open\cb3 \ \cb1 your heart even wider sinking further into the peaceful and serene energy of\cb3 \ \cb1 this cave spend a few more silent moments listening to the wisdom of the\cb3 \ \cb1 wars that surround you the mind remains quiet as the heart remains receptive\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 coming now to a deeply settled

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this chakra balancing\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation that it's aim is to help to bring harmony to your chakras cleansing\cb3 \ \cb1 your aura and guiding you into a deep restorative sleep before we begin I'd\cb3 \ \cb1 like to give you a little bit of a background on the nature of the chakras within the body there are seven main\cb3 \ \cb1 chakras that line the spine we can imagine these chakras as spinning\cb3 \ \cb1 vortexes of energy unseen to the eye they underlie whatever our current\cb3 \ \cb1 experience may be each chakra corresponds to specific organs feelings\cb3 \ \cb1 and behaviors this healing meditation will bring awareness to these energy centers and balance them allowing energy\cb3 \ \cb1 to flow freely in all parts of our body we'll explore these in more detail as we\cb3 \ \cb1 dive into our meditation but for now rest in the knowledge that regardless of\cb3 \ \cb1 how you come into this meditation you will soon bring harmony to each one of\cb3 \ \cb1 these spinning centers of energy to each level of yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 as the chakras begin to balance your overall being will come into greater\cb3 \ \cb1 harmony and transcendence a deep and healing cleanse of your overall aura\cb3 \ \cb1 will take place and soon you will enter into a deep and restful sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 so to begin make sure that you are comfortable you might like to use any\cb3 \ \cb1 cushions or blankets that you need to make sure that your body is prepared to relax fully\cb3 \ \cb1 and sure than any potential distractions such as computers are turned off and\cb3 \ \cb1 that you will not be disturbed as you enter into this healing meditation and\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep once your body is prepared for relaxation allow your mind to follow\cb3 \ \cb1 to invite any lingering thoughts of the day to gently loosen their grip and fall\cb3 \ \cb1 away so let us begin now the tune into your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath in order to guide the mind away from thought let it flow deeply in and\cb3 \ \cb1 out of your body allowing it to renew you in each unfolding moment\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few deep breaths here now\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next inhalation bring your attention to the top of your head and\cb3 \ \cb1 just allowing the breath to follow at its natural rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next breath in pause for a moment and then allow that exhale to\cb3 \ \cb1 come all the way back down to the base of the spine just breathing slowly and\cb3 \ \cb1 gently\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to pay attention to your breathing for a few more cycles creating\cb3 \ \cb1 a pathway of light of breath along your spine upwards on each inhale and\cb3 \ \cb1 downwards on each exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 allow this breathwork to guide you into a deep state of relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 now come back to your normal breath allowing it to flow effortlessly through you\cb3 \ \cb1 we'll begin our journey by connecting to the lowest chakra to the root chakra\cb3 \ \cb1 bring your awareness to the base of your spine once more in order to connect with\cb3 \ \cb1 this chakra residing at the pelvic floor this energy center is our base it is\cb3 \ \cb1 from where we harness our sense of support security and safety as we make\cb3 \ \cb1 our way through this journey on earth\cb3 \ \cb1 when the root chakra is balanced we feel grounded and connected to the place we\cb3 \ \cb1 are presently in we feel safe to journey out knowing the deep roots connect us to\cb3 \ \cb1 our inner and outer foundations we can\cb3 \ \cb1 feel the earth steep embrace knowing that the earth provides what we require\cb3 \ \cb1 to live harmoniously the color of this\cb3 \ \cb1 chakra is red take a moment now to breathe deeply into the base of the\cb3 \ \cb1 spine envisioning the warmth of the color red\cb3 \ \cb1 allow it to ground you in the present moment physically emotionally and\cb3 \ \cb1 spiritually know that you are safe here safe to enter into this deep state of\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation and harmony allow the music\cb3 \ \cb1 my voice your physical world and your inner world to support you\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to introduce slowly and gently the affirmation I am safe and supported I am\cb3 \ \cb1 safe and supported I am safe and\cb3 \ \cb1 supported\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue breathing deeply into the pelvic floor allowing yourself to feel\cb3 \ \cb1 intimately connected to the physical space you rest in sinking Deva to your\cb3 \ \cb1 body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now moving upwards gently guide your attention to the sacral chakra located between the pubic\cb3 \ \cb1 bone and the navel within this swirling vortex of energy we find our sense of\cb3 \ \cb1 creativity intimacy sexuality and connection to others emotions arise from\cb3 \ \cb1 this Center and you may find that as we venture into this space you sense this\cb3 \ \cb1 rising of the emotional world if this is\cb3 \ \cb1 true to your experience at this point or any other moment during this meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 know that you are supported and loved exactly as you are\cb3 \ \cb1 rest in the knowledge that you are being balanced and healed in this very moment simply by allowing the music and these\cb3 \ \cb1 words to permeate your being when the\cb3 \ \cb1 sacral chakra is balanced we experience pleasure abundance joy and warmth we\cb3 \ \cb1 feel intimately connected to those around us and feel harmonious within our\cb3 \ \cb1 relationships we experience the joy of the nature of life the joy of creation\cb3 \ \cb1 so take a moment to envision the color orange now with your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 allow it to permeate this space between your hips just above your pubic bone and\cb3 \ \cb1 feel yourself begin to open up to this warmth and to this healing slowly begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to introduce the affirmation I am connected to others I flow freely\cb3 \ \cb1 I am connected to others I flow really\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe deeply into the sacral chakra and return to this affirmation as many times as the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 wanders I am connected to others I flow really\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 we will now continue our ascension to the solar plexus located just above the\cb3 \ \cb1 navel this energy center brings us confidence self-worth and personal power\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment now to envision this radiant vortex just above the navel ear\cb3 \ \cb1 into its innate power and its warmth\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] when the solar plexus is balanced we\cb3 \ \cb1 feel a strong sense of purpose motivation and direction when balanced\cb3 \ \cb1 we hold a calm confidence in our ability to manifest the life we desire we move\cb3 \ \cb1 confidently in the direction of our dreams [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 bring your awareness to the solar plexus now envisioning the radiance and\cb3 \ \cb1 lightness of the color yellow\cb3 \ \cb1 be ovis energy center expanding radiating out from your core and\cb3 \ \cb1 carrying it with a new sensation of aliveness purpose and a sure but subtle\cb3 \ \cb1 strength\cb3 \ \cb1 feel Solar plexis awakening meeting this bright healing yellow light as it grows\cb3 \ \cb1 and expands\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now gently introduce the affirmation I radiate confidence I radiate confidence\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let us move gently now into the heart chakra the home of our innately\cb3 \ \cb1 compassionate and loving nature bring your attention to this space in the\cb3 \ \cb1 center of your chest and envision your heart expanding with each inhale and\cb3 \ \cb1 softening with each exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] this middle chakra where our downward\cb3 \ \cb1 moving and upward flowing energies meet in perfect harmony is where our capacity\cb3 \ \cb1 for love resides when balanced we are able to give love\cb3 \ \cb1 unconditionally and we are able to receive the same gift from others and\cb3 \ \cb1 from ourselves [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 rest now in the simplicity of this beautiful compassionate center envision\cb3 \ \cb1 the color green expanding from the heart with each breath notice the pure energy\cb3 \ \cb1 of the heart radiating outwards healing the heart itself and also the entirety\cb3 \ \cb1 of your being [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the hearts message is quite simple take a moment to introduce the affirmation I\cb3 \ \cb1 love and am loved\cb3 \ \cb1 allow it to permeate all cells of your being as you slowly repeat yourself I\cb3 \ \cb1 love and am loved continue to give the\cb3 \ \cb1 heart permission to expand and to soften knowing that it is safe to do so right\cb3 \ \cb1 here right now [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 gently guide your awareness now up to the throat chakra sitting in the throat\cb3 \ \cb1 area this expansive vortex of energy governs our ability to speak our\cb3 \ \cb1 authentic truth and to listen to that of others allow your attention now to\cb3 \ \cb1 settle here noticing any sensations residing deep in the throat\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 when the throat chakra is balanced we find a lightness and trust in who we are\cb3 \ \cb1 and find freedom to express our highest truths communication is an open space\cb3 \ \cb1 and an exchange so what we are able to give we are able to receive when\cb3 \ \cb1 balanced we are able to listen compassionately to the true expression of another being\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to envision the color blue expanding from the throat imagining it\cb3 \ \cb1 radiating upwards from where you rest painting the entire sky let it surround\cb3 \ \cb1 you allow your being to flow freely within this vast blue atmosphere\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 feel into the lightness of the free air trusting where it gently moves you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 gently introduced the mantra I express my truth really i express my truth\cb3 \ \cb1 freely [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the body becoming lighter as you embrace your expanding authentic being\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 come now softly to the third eye this energy center swells between your\cb3 \ \cb1 eyebrows and is the Gateway to your inner knowledge take a moment to bring\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention to this space sensing the freely spinning energy exists here\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] when the third eye is balanced we are able to access our inner knowing and our\cb3 \ \cb1 higher mind with greater ease our perceptions are clearer and our\cb3 \ \cb1 intuition is strengthened we do not need to speak the wisdom that comes at this\cb3 \ \cb1 level we are simply able to

under the gentle but warm rays of an early Sun there is a\cb3 \ \cb1 subtle breeze that's teasing your hair and soft against your skin the sky is a\cb3 \ \cb1 beautiful blue cloudless and stretches forever sinking only onto a distant\cb3 \ \cb1 horizon where the sea and the sky unite in a matching Azur color you feel\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxed free and look around you take in\cb3 \ \cb1 the most beautiful picture postcard scene you were sitting in a sheltered\cb3 \ \cb1 Cove with glorious cliffs reaching up into the sky providing a secure backdrop\cb3 \ \cb1 to this perfect scene the rocky cliffs\cb3 \ \cb1 glimmer gray and red with the warming intensity of the Sun and you catch\cb3 \ \cb1 glimpses of white feathers as seabird soar and dive circling on rising\cb3 \ \cb1 thermals distant bird songs filter\cb3 \ \cb1 through the air and the piercing cause of seagulls swooping high and low over\cb3 \ \cb1 the gentle waves brings back childhood memories of seaside escapades\cb3 \ \cb1 a light breeze whips across the sandy\cb3 \ \cb1 cove and the Sun burns even brighter in the sky you stand up and walk along the\cb3 \ \cb1 coastline dealing the warm sand on the soles of your feet and through your toes\cb3 \ \cb1 frothy waves wash up onto the beach and in the distance white sailing boats\cb3 \ \cb1 drift by the feeling is one of peace as\cb3 \ \cb1 you walk along the golden sands you see up ahead what seems like a gentle\cb3 \ \cb1 homeless man with a small dog walking on the edge of the lapping waters he's\cb3 \ \cb1 looking up to the sky muttering to himself and calling out to the seagulls\cb3 \ \cb1 clothed in tattered pants and a white baggy shirt with an overgrown beard\cb3 \ \cb1 carrying two bags of what looks like clothes and blankets he approaches you\cb3 \ \cb1 in turns and speaks directly to you your treasure chest is near in a deep cavern\cb3 \ \cb1 his voice trails off as he passes you however a breeze picks up and you hear\cb3 \ \cb1 his final words riches beyond belief you\cb3 \ \cb1 turn to see him once more however as you do this he and his dog are nowhere to be\cb3 \ \cb1 seen\cb3 \ \cb1 you sit for a moment on the sandy beach to collect your thoughts wondering what\cb3 \ \cb1 that was all about his words echo inside your head your treasure chest is near\cb3 \ \cb1 riches beyond belief getting up from the\cb3 \ \cb1 sand you are drawn to a cliff face opposite the beach that appears to have\cb3 \ \cb1 a cave carved within it out of curiosity\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin to move towards it clambering carefully over small rocks strewn out\cb3 \ \cb1 into their ever reaching tides you wander through small rock pools feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 the coolness of the water on your feet the beach cave looks welcoming and as\cb3 \ \cb1 you approach the rocks have been smoothed as if by hand and you reach out\cb3 \ \cb1 and trail your fingers against the entrance to the cavern walls there is a\cb3 \ \cb1 coolness in places and in others the rocks are warm to the touch where the\cb3 \ \cb1 Sun touches them\cb3 \ \cb1 as you take in the scene in front of you and move forward you see dappling light around the walls\cb3 \ \cb1 of the cave mesmerizing welcoming and intriguing the temperature within the\cb3 \ \cb1 entrance dips immediately but it isn't cold it feels nice to be out of the\cb3 \ \cb1 sunlight for a while marvel at the contours of the beach cave in front of\cb3 \ \cb1 you pockets of stone walkways smooth walls\cb3 \ \cb1 with a contrast of light and dark as small gaps in the rock face allow the\cb3 \ \cb1 Sun to penetrate the darkened depths the\cb3 \ \cb1 beach cave has a strange almost spiritual feel to it peaceful and\cb3 \ \cb1 tranquil and yet it feels as if it has had a purpose not simply carved by the\cb3 \ \cb1 elements but by loving hands smoothing the stone into submission the sound of\cb3 \ \cb1 water can be heard echoing from deeper into the cave although the tide is\cb3 \ \cb1 gently lapping along the rocks leading to the cave entrance inside the low\cb3 \ \cb1 rocks are dry so no danger from an encroaching tide the temperature changes\cb3 \ \cb1 as you move deeper into the labyrinth of cavernous rooms a carved archway lies\cb3 \ \cb1 ahead of you and the cave room within flickers and sparkles with flecks of\cb3 \ \cb1 green as you move into the deeper part of the cavern you hear the words once\cb3 \ \cb1 more vibrating throughout the cave your treasure is near in a cavern riches beyond belief\cb3 \ \cb1 you're drawn to move forward and enter a space so soothing and peaceful that you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel any remaining tension dissipate to your right deeper within the cave you\cb3 \ \cb1 see what looks to be a dusty old ornate chest moving to this large old crate\cb3 \ \cb1 curious to see what this is you blow the dust and sand away it reveals to you\cb3 \ \cb1 what looks to be an ancient old treasure chest could this be the treasure chest the\cb3 \ \cb1 homeless man on the beach was referring to treasure nearby you sit in front of\cb3 \ \cb1 it get comfortable and loosen the already unlocked latches the chest opens\cb3 \ \cb1 it glistens with gold you see that is divided into three sections they're\cb3 \ \cb1 marked past present and future and in\cb3 \ \cb1 each section a small tin boxes [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you glanced into the section of the chest marked past and see a little green\cb3 \ \cb1 emerald encrusted tin taking this out\cb3 \ \cb1 easing the lid off slowly you see two folded pieces of paper you unfold the\cb3 \ \cb1 first piece gently and it has printed in beautiful handwritten calligraphy the\cb3 \ \cb1 words let go take a moment to meditate\cb3 \ \cb1 on this what is this telling you is this\cb3 \ \cb1 something from the past that you need to release and let go of perhaps an old\cb3 \ \cb1 relationship a habit that no longer serves you for you or your highest good\cb3 \ \cb1 just take these next few moments to let go and find peace in the release of old\cb3 \ \cb1 and worn-out patterns [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you decide to read the next piece of paper you gently unfold it and it says\cb3 \ \cb1 the word forgive you think about this\cb3 \ \cb1 for a moment have you been harboring some distaste for someone or something that has\cb3 \ \cb1 happened to you in your past possibly someone who has mistreated you or maybe\cb3 \ \cb1 you need to forgive yourself and let go of guilt that you have been beating yourself up over for a long time just\cb3 \ \cb1 spend the next few moments contemplating forgiveness and release any pain you've\cb3 \ \cb1 held on to this long enough set yourself free\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you place both of these papers back into the emerald tin putting it gently back\cb3 \ \cb1 into the chest where you found it as you do this you feel a cool breeze blow\cb3 \ \cb1 gently throughout the cavern as if clearing away any final thoughts on\cb3 \ \cb1 letting go and forgiveness\cb3 \ \cb1 you reach back into the chest and take out a ruby encrusted tin that has been\cb3 \ \cb1 marked with the word present\cb3 \ \cb1 excited to open this you peel back the old tin lid to reveal a piece of paper\cb3 \ \cb1 that says meditate on three things you are grateful for today give thanks for\cb3 \ \cb1 what you currently have in your life take a moment think this through are you\cb3 \ \cb1 living with a roof over your head do you have food to eat maybe you have great\cb3 \ \cb1 friends family or even a loving pet think of three things you are grateful\cb3 \ \cb1 for in this moment and give thanks true thanks to your higher power within when\cb3 \ \cb1 we are grateful for all we have more of what we want will show up in our lives\cb3 \ \cb1 meditate on these words in the next few moments what am i grateful for\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you place the folded paper back into the ruby encrusted tin placing it back in\cb3 \ \cb1 the treasure chest before you you reach in and take up the last small box\cb3 \ \cb1 this one is diamund and crusted it glistens even within the dark cavern\cb3 \ \cb1 itself it has the words future carved in black on the top of the lid you are\cb3 \ \cb1 excited to open this one to see what it holds for you and you open it and notice\cb3 \ \cb1 three pieces of paper within you grab the first one out and slowly unravel it\cb3 \ \cb1 the words my career seemed to appear as if by magic on this paper you give this\cb3 \ \cb1 some thought what is it you truly want to do for your working life what would\cb3 \ \cb1 you want to do if you didn't have to be answerable to anyone envision this take\cb3 \ \cb1 a few moments to see what you are doing what are other people doing or saying\cb3 \ \cb1 that tells you that you have achieved this dream possibly you already have\cb3 \ \cb1 your dream job but want to take a moment to give gratitude be with this for the\cb3 \ \cb1 next few moments see it feel it be it\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you place this little piece of paper back in the diamond tin and reach in to\cb3 \ \cb1 grab the other piece of paper opening it up slowly the words relationships and\cb3 \ \cb1 love are written what does this

let's begin\cb3 \ \cb1 visualize yourself now transported to the steps leading up to an old bridge\cb3 \ \cb1 made from stone weathered from time and from an assault by the elements there\cb3 \ \cb1 are steps curving upwards with cast iron railings swirling alongside affording\cb3 \ \cb1 magnificent views across the deep tranquil waters surrounded by a mass of\cb3 \ \cb1 greenery the breeze is soft against your\cb3 \ \cb1 skin warm but soothing visualize\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself moving up the steps each step is worn and uneven but they\cb3 \ \cb1 are shallow you find them easy to climb\cb3 \ \cb1 trail your fingers across the top of the railings and feel the iron warm beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 your fingertips\cb3 \ \cb1 at the final step turn and look across the expanse of water it is afternoon and\cb3 \ \cb1 the Sun has started its gradual descent across the sky and as the light changes\cb3 \ \cb1 the trees surrounding the water glow and the colors change\cb3 \ \cb1 for perhaps the first time you become in tune with nature you become aware of the\cb3 \ \cb1 depth of color that exists as clouds\cb3 \ \cb1 scurry across the blue expanse of sky notice how the light shifts and the\cb3 \ \cb1 sun's rays muted send rays of gold across the tranquil waters flecks of\cb3 \ \cb1 light dance on the tips of slow-moving water cresting in places this place\cb3 \ \cb1 exudes serenity you feel calm\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel relaxed you feel peaceful\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale deeply drawing fresh pure oxygen\cb3 \ \cb1 deeply into your lungs exhale fully\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling your lungs deflate as you do so\cb3 \ \cb1 and repeat this intake of breath feeling air inflating your lungs once more and\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe out let go of any negative feelings or tension that you\cb3 \ \cb1 may be harboring in your body just let it all go\cb3 \ \cb1 turn your attention back to the scene in front of you and notice the power of\cb3 \ \cb1 blue sky as if dabbed on creatively and mixed with cotton wool white to form the\cb3 \ \cb1 clouds a screen of green adorns the\cb3 \ \cb1 edges of blue the breeze sends leaves whirling up into the air along with the\cb3 \ \cb1 blossom you watch it as it cascades even\cb3 \ \cb1 higher at the mercy of the air current and gradually released dropping towards\cb3 \ \cb1 the surface of the water where once lazy fish rise to the surface to investigate\cb3 \ \cb1 as you stand here and observe you realize that you are an integral part of\cb3 \ \cb1 this scene there is a sense of oneness\cb3 \ \cb1 yet you have not been here before it is\cb3 \ \cb1 as if something has been missing in life previously and now there is a sense of\cb3 \ \cb1 wonder as to what is to come ask yourself who are you deep within\cb3 \ \cb1 what do you need what are you searching for\cb3 \ \cb1 just allow these questions to resonate within you\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel a deeply wonderful connection with nature more than you have thought\cb3 \ \cb1 was possible you feel mesmerised by the\cb3 \ \cb1 sun's rays as they penetrate the foliage casting an almost autumn glow as clouds\cb3 \ \cb1 scurry past the Sun the light changes again and this time the leaves are\cb3 \ \cb1 shimmering gold and yellow these trees\cb3 \ \cb1 are different they Bend and sway teased by the breeze\cb3 \ \cb1 it is as if you are standing on the threshold of two worlds it is as if\cb3 \ \cb1 you're looking back over the past and all that could have been when you turn\cb3 \ \cb1 and look in the other direction your perspective shifts and you are filled\cb3 \ \cb1 with positive energy life is fleeting\cb3 \ \cb1 every second merges with the next and clock hands continue to move never\cb3 \ \cb1 pausing each passing moment striding fords to greet the next and such is life\cb3 \ \cb1 with each season that blends effortlessly the world continues to turn\cb3 \ \cb1 this place feels almost spiritual and it feels as if the missing piece of the\cb3 \ \cb1 puzzle revealing the secrets of the universe as clicked into place this is a\cb3 \ \cb1 place where the past the present and the future merge here life is almost\cb3 \ \cb1 timeless you have time to think to feel and to\cb3 \ \cb1 embrace the positive energy that is here you can contemplate and carve out a\cb3 \ \cb1 route towards happiness in life there\cb3 \ \cb1 are many lessons to be learned as we can learn much through letting go of tension\cb3 \ \cb1 and of deeply relaxing calming the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 only then in your mind perceive all that is possible so relax breathing in and\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing out\cb3 \ \cb1 be at peace with yourself find\cb3 \ \cb1 contentment in this moment as the birds\cb3 \ \cb1 above perform well choreographed flight across the sky effectively using the air\cb3 \ \cb1 currents to lift and twist and turn and\cb3 \ \cb1 butterflies flutter delicately their reflections mirrored in the water below\cb3 \ \cb1 you know that you have never been so at peace with nature you yearn for the\cb3 \ \cb1 freedom to fly and understand that to be free we sometimes have to make changes\cb3 \ \cb1 in life\cb3 \ \cb1 fragrance fills the air as plants lift their faces up to the Sun as you breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 in this delicate fragrance clears any muddled thoughts away and soothes your\cb3 \ \cb1 soul\cb3 \ \cb1 turning now you see a narrow trail leading off into the woodland space and\cb3 \ \cb1 tempted begin to move towards it feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 each step down as you leave the bridge\cb3 \ \cb1 this trail undulates throughout fresh young saplings and shrubs all the eyeing\cb3 \ \cb1 for their place in the sunlight you\cb3 \ \cb1 follow a small Inlet of water that meanders across the narrow trail\cb3 \ \cb1 alongside your chosen pathway it is\cb3 \ \cb1 cooler here with some of the taller trees blocking sunlight with only\cb3 \ \cb1 glimpses of gold penetrating those taller trees and the Rays and you bathe\cb3 \ \cb1 in natural light replenishing your aura\cb3 \ \cb1 you watch as the leaves fall you see\cb3 \ \cb1 each one with a shimmering energy as the leaf spirals around and dances on the\cb3 \ \cb1 breeze this brings an instant sense of\cb3 \ \cb1 reflection into your mind what do you need to let go of in life what changes\cb3 \ \cb1 are necessary to help you grow and develop as a person and to reach your\cb3 \ \cb1 full potential\cb3 \ \cb1 which part of your life needs more focus\cb3 \ \cb1 do you long for love perhaps you need a career satisfaction each one of us needs\cb3 \ \cb1 to find our own pathway through life so that we can reach our true

soar to if you let go of the stresses and\cb3 \ \cb1 strains of life do you feel shackled to\cb3 \ \cb1 the past isn't it time to break free and to\cb3 \ \cb1 explore all there is to offer visualize now the chains of life breaking free and\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in deeply inhaling the purest joy that freedom offers and exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly casting all doubts to one side\cb3 \ \cb1 mentally repeat these words to yourself I allow instinct to guide me\cb3 \ \cb1 I embrace freedom of choice I welcome\cb3 \ \cb1 the opportunity to make life changes\cb3 \ \cb1 I fully embrace my abundant life\cb3 \ \cb1 the sound of water nearby is soothing\cb3 \ \cb1 your eyes feel heavy asleep gently nudges you follow a new pathway taking\cb3 \ \cb1 you to the water's edge where dark and light depths greet you this pathway\cb3 \ \cb1 resonates with you it shows you that life is a series of choices walk the\cb3 \ \cb1 road less traveled and you may be rewarded with experiences and successes\cb3 \ \cb1 you

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation this meditation will help you to harness\cb3 \ \cb1 positive energy achieve deep relaxation and sink into inner peace my name is jason\cb3 \ \cb1 stevenson and during this evening session i will guide you to mindfully ease both\cb3 \ \cb1 mind and body before we journey deep into a healing salt cave\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing you need to know for this practice and nothing you need to actively achieve\cb3 \ \cb1 simply let the words offered here guide you back into your innate\cb3 \ \cb1 sense of balance wholeness and presence\cb3 \ \cb1 to begin tonight's meditation just take a moment to ensure that you are as comfortable as you can be\cb3 \ \cb1 supported by any cushions or pillows that you have available whether on your side or on your back\cb3 \ \cb1 ensure that your spine is long and your neck is aligned with your spine\cb3 \ \cb1 you may close your eyes now if you haven't already done so and then just take a few moments to let\cb3 \ \cb1 your mind catch up to the present moment paying attention to what it feels like\cb3 \ \cb1 to be right here right now\cb3 \ \cb1 you might notice the felt sensation of the mattress beneath you or the blankets that cover you\cb3 \ \cb1 or you might open your awareness to the sounds that filter through your ears\cb3 \ \cb1 alternatively you might arrive mentally in this present moment by noticing what\cb3 \ \cb1 it feels like to breathe observing the subtle expansion and contraction that occurs with each breath\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever sensations help you to arrive in the present moment just spend a few moments noticing them\cb3 \ \cb1 without judgment\cb3 \ \cb1 notice if the mind wants to label your experience as good or bad\cb3 \ \cb1 right or wrong and then simply let those labels go as you breathe out\cb3 \ \cb1 coming back to the very simple practice of just\cb3 \ \cb1 noticing [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and now take a moment to notice your physical body beginning by drawing your attention to\cb3 \ \cb1 the top of your head from here gently start to scan your body\cb3 \ \cb1 downwards noticing if there are any areas of tension that you might be able to soften\cb3 \ \cb1 or release\cb3 \ \cb1 just simply let any physical tension start to dissolve into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 as if it were melting away\cb3 \ \cb1 as we move through this practice you will likely notice that from time to time\cb3 \ \cb1 negative thoughts worries or other unhelpful ideas and images might\cb3 \ \cb1 rise to your awareness these fearful or negative thought patterns are\cb3 \ \cb1 the very things that stand in the way of our experiencing deep peace\cb3 \ \cb1 positivity and relaxation now what typically happens when negative\cb3 \ \cb1 or worried thoughts arise is one of two things first we might find\cb3 \ \cb1 ourselves becoming completely swept up by these mental stories\cb3 \ \cb1 when we are not mindful of these thought patterns they can weigh heavily on our sense of\cb3 \ \cb1 well-being and then a second type of relationship\cb3 \ \cb1 we might have with these thoughts is one of avoidance and suppression\cb3 \ \cb1 avoidance and suppression however are not long-term solutions to troublesome or racing thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 if what we are after is deep peace positivity and contentment we must first\cb3 \ \cb1 cultivate a more nourishing balanced relationship with our thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 and from here we can explore the possibility of welcoming positive energy and ideas into our\cb3 \ \cb1 consciousness so as thoughts arise during this\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation i invite you to witness these occurrences as if you were an\cb3 \ \cb1 outside observer of them rather than being caught up in the stream itself\cb3 \ \cb1 consider that you are standing at the side of the riverbank watching mental objects come\cb3 \ \cb1 and watching them go\cb3 \ \cb1 practice this for a few moments on your own now before we move deeper into our salt cave visualization\cb3 \ \cb1 to cultivate positive energy and a deep sense of peace simply observe\cb3 \ \cb1 any thoughts that arise with care and maintaining a subtle gap between\cb3 \ \cb1 them and yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 if certain thoughts seem to have a heavy pull you might alternatively guide these\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts down to the center of your heart to be released focusing your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 on this loving center in your chest\cb3 \ \cb1 now to cleanse yourself more completely before we step into our visualization\cb3 \ \cb1 i invite you to take three long deep breaths and releasing with a soft sigh through\cb3 \ \cb1 the mouth on each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 after that final exhalation let your breath return to its natural rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 and your attention to turn towards the creative capacity of your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 within your creative mental space you find yourself now on a rural road\cb3 \ \cb1 both sides lined with summer trees in full blossom aromas of jasmine and lavender dance\cb3 \ \cb1 through the air filling your heart and mind with each full breath\cb3 \ \cb1 the dirt road you are on heads north weaving through the fertile land in the\cb3 \ \cb1 direction of a sweet sanctuary a salt cave spa\cb3 \ \cb1 where you will rest deeply for the night to come all you carry with you is a small\cb3 \ \cb1 backpack of belongings an open mind and a vibrant heart\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly and gently you walk down the country road in the direction of the peaceful retreat\cb3 \ \cb1 absorbing the natural landscape that holds you\cb3 \ \cb1 as you journey you admire the vibrancy and vitality of this summer season\cb3 \ \cb1 you note the pastel purple blossoms in the trees the shimmering meadows and the rich\cb3 \ \cb1 healthy farmland that has been well cared for\cb3 \ \cb1 butterflies flitter from wildflower to wildflower filling the open air with beauty and\cb3 \ \cb1 wonder\cb3 \ \cb1 far into the distance way beyond the furthest trees\cb3 \ \cb1 the sun begins its descent warm orange glow is cast upon the land\cb3 \ \cb1 as the earth spins away from the sun for another day you let your entire body be bathed in\cb3 \ \cb1 its warm\cb3 \ \cb1 it doesn't take long before the spa comes into view the salt cave sanctuary is housed in a\cb3 \ \cb1 grand stone mansion built some centuries ago\cb3 \ \cb1 it is covered in whispering vines and rambling roses the gardens surrounding it are wild yet\cb3 \ \cb1 still well tendered the place is soothing inviting a wave of surrender to wash\cb3 \ \cb1 through your body and mind\cb3 \ \cb1 you make your way closer to the entrance soon arriving on the front porch\cb3 \ \cb1 before entering you take a moment to say good night to the setting sun\cb3 \ \cb1 you revel in the orange pink light that appears above the tree line\cb3 \ \cb1 and then gently you make your way inside\cb3 \ \cb1 you have arrived after regular check-in hours and so a key has been left out for you\cb3 \ \cb1 picking it up you notice that the tag reads salt sweet three and then you follow the\cb3 \ \cb1 hallway that leads to your room\cb3 \ \cb1 the dimly lit spa hallway is infused with the sweet smell of orange oil\cb3 \ \cb1 the soft candles fastened to the walls add an air of elegance while guiding you toward the room that\cb3 \ \cb1 will be yours for the coming night\cb3 \ \cb1 as you reach salt suite 3 you let yourself in with the key\cb3 \ \cb1 unveiling a beautiful softly lit bedroom and another door that leads down to your\cb3 \ \cb1 very own salt cave [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 upon the bed is a cotton robe dropping your backpack and taking off\cb3 \ \cb1 your shoes you prepare yourself for restorative evening ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 and change into the cozy robe\cb3 \ \cb1 before you enter the door to the salt cave you notice a jug of lemon water has been\cb3 \ \cb1 placed out before you you pour yourself a small glass and then\cb3 \ \cb1 raise it to your lips feeling the properties of both water and\cb3 \ \cb1 lemon cleansing hydrating and alkalizing your body\cb3 \ \cb1 as you sip you feel yourself coming into a deeper state of balance\cb3 \ \cb1 both mentally and physically\cb3 \ \cb1 now you decide to head into the salt cave and as you open the door to enter\cb3 \ \cb1 you are faced with a set of stairs lit by the soft glow of smoldering candles\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a long deep breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 and letting it go with the sigh\cb3 \ \cb1 and then you begin your descent step by step\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] with each step you take you feel your mind growing more relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 and your heart growing wider\cb3 \ \cb1 your body softens too your forehead jaw and shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 all melting towards the wooden stairs beneath your feet [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 a warm amber glow from the bottom of the staircase entrances you sending a rippling wave of warmth and\cb3 \ \cb1 positivity through your cells\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you reach that lower level your jaw drops at the side of it\cb3 \ \cb1 the cave-like room covered in soft pink salt the walls are made of salt as\cb3 \ \cb1 is the floor beneath you as you step off that final stair it feels as if you\cb3 \ \cb1 are stepping onto a beautiful soothing beach\cb3 \ \cb1 all around you small candles are lit radiating an orange glow through salt\cb3 \ \cb1 candle holders and through the air of the room you\cb3 \ \cb1 notice that sweet smell of orange oil once again\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a long full breath in slowly letting it go as a subtle smile\cb3 \ \cb1 stretches across your face\cb3 \ \cb1 in the center of the room a cushion and blanket rest\cb3 \ \cb1 you make your way towards them and then rest your back on the soothing nourishing salt\cb3 \ \cb1 your head rests on the pillow and you lay the blanket across your body from the neck down\cb3 \ \cb1 arms rest by your sides your feet fall outwards naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 and your entire body surrenders into the salt crystals beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] candlelight flickers against the walls\cb3 \ \cb1 and ceiling of the cave guiding you into a calm and tranquil\cb3 \ \cb1 state of being\cb3 \ \cb1 now you become more acutely aware of the music that flows through the cave\cb3 \ \cb1 sounds that work on an energetic level to cleanse both body and mind and to\cb3 \ \cb1 uplift and nourish your vibration\cb3 \ \cb1 as the sounds permeate your cells all worries all\cb3 \ \cb1 fears all limiting beliefs\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to untangle themselves falling away from your body and into the\cb3 \ \cb1 salt beneath you for transformation you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel the warmth of the coarse salt against your body it unwraps you holding you\cb3 \ \cb1 unconditionally against the earth the air you breathe is enriched with\cb3 \ \cb1 salt too rejuvenating your entire being with each breath\cb3 \ \cb1 you soften your belly and relax your shoulders even further allowing each breath to flow as deep as\cb3 \ \cb1 it comfortably reaches\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you imagine each breath extending out from your lungs\cb3 \ \cb1 traveling deep into any parts of you that are in need of care and nourishment\cb3 \ \cb1 focusing in on any particular area of concern whether of mind or body you direct the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath to that part of you letting each inhalation bring with it fresh regenerative\cb3 \ \cb1 positive energy\cb3 \ \cb1 and each exhalation to free you of limiting or negative thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 the salt cave absorbs everything that no longer serves you working its alchemical magic to restore\cb3 \ \cb1 any heavy energy to its original pure state\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe here to bathe in the soothing sounds of the salt cave\cb3 \ \cb1 and to sink into the crystals beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 the candles continue to burn casting that soft orange light across the cave\cb3 \ \cb1 your own body too absorbs the healing glow as the candles flicker gently they\cb3 \ \cb1 bestow upon you an extra wave of love light and positivity\cb3 \ \cb1 you are growing tired now nearly ready to surrender to the night completely\cb3 \ \cb1 though there is a bed upstairs waiting you you long to rest where you are to sleep amidst the salt\cb3 \ \cb1 crystals and to continue absorbing their positive soothing energy as you slumber\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a moment now to make any final adjustments to your position so that you can drift away effortlessly\cb3 \ \cb1 and then you close your eyes to the salt cave slipping into the empty spaciousness\cb3 \ \cb1 within you\cb3 \ \cb1 the beautiful music continues to flow through your ears carrying you softly into sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 you drift away slowly feeling love and warmth pervading mind body and spirit\cb3 \ \cb1 you know there is nothing left for you to do but to let go to sink further and further into a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 night of peace ease and tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath and the sound vibrations carry you there until soon\cb3 \ \cb1 you find that you have arrived in the world of sweet and restorative dreams\cb3 \ \cb1 good night my friend good night\cb3 \ \cb1 foreign\cb3 \ \cb1

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello there my name is jason stevenson and welcome to tonight's guided meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 to help calm the mind and release anxious thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 in tonight's meditation i'll provide you with guidance to witness anxious thought streams\cb3 \ \cb1 to surrender to them and to return to your inner peace whoever you\cb3 \ \cb1 are no matter what you are experiencing you are welcome here\cb3 \ \cb1 we will move through this process slowly and gently and you'll be given plenty of time to\cb3 \ \cb1 shift and soften any anxiety that is present for you\cb3 \ \cb1 during this practice you are encouraged to drift off to sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 whenever slumber comes naturally for you\cb3 \ \cb1 so we will begin by taking a few moments to settle in through breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and body awareness and then i will guide you to a comfortable place\cb3 \ \cb1 in the middle of a tranquil forest an environment that will further help\cb3 \ \cb1 you to let go\cb3 \ \cb1 and so before we begin take a moment to find a comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 laying down position that will be supportive of deep sleep when the time comes\cb3 \ \cb1 just allow your spine to lengthen and your limbs to soften\cb3 \ \cb1 as you feel into how gravity is holding you here right now\cb3 \ \cb1 closing your eyes whenever you feel ready\cb3 \ \cb1 and take a moment to check in with your physical body\cb3 \ \cb1 just inquire with your body about whether you might need anything else in this moment perhaps a\cb3 \ \cb1 pillow a blanket a pair of socks or any other\cb3 \ \cb1 adjustment\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you're ready find a comfortable position of relative stillness you don't need to aim\cb3 \ \cb1 for complete stillness as your body is always in subtle motion anyways\cb3 \ \cb1 but see if you can surrender as much as you can into non-doing\cb3 \ \cb1 knowing that you are always free to make adjustments as you need to throughout the practice\cb3 \ \cb1 and turn your attention towards the breath for a few moments now just minding its natural rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 as it moves through your body\cb3 \ \cb1 and for the next few breath cycles refrain from changing the breath in any\cb3 \ \cb1 way simply allow it to flow naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 while also considering the fact that each full breath cleanses and nourishes and supports you\cb3 \ \cb1 each breath in restores your blood of the oxygen it requires\cb3 \ \cb1 and each breath out emits what no longer serve you\cb3 \ \cb1 and now i invite you to take three deep breaths at your own pace beginning whenever you are\cb3 \ \cb1 ready and inhaling to the furthest depth that is still\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable for you and then exhale maybe releasing a soft\cb3 \ \cb1 sigh or anything else that yearns to be let go of\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale completely\cb3 \ \cb1 and exhale what you no longer need\cb3 \ \cb1 after your third deep breath just continue to breathe naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 and then take a moment to re-ground into the surface supporting you\cb3 \ \cb1 and just take note of each part of your body that is in contact with your bed\cb3 \ \cb1 and noting the sensation of fabric against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 and before we move into the forest inside your mind just take a moment to offer a word of\cb3 \ \cb1 gratitude for the place that holds you right now\cb3 \ \cb1 make a note of any aspects of your environment that you can be thankful for in this very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you're finished turn towards the creative center within your own mind\cb3 \ \cb1 and through your mind i invite you to travel consciously now finding yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 in a brilliant forest held beneath the warm late summer sun\cb3 \ \cb1 you were standing on a narrow footpath of aromatic amber soil\cb3 \ \cb1 and on either side of you majestic trees stretch up towards the beaming\cb3 \ \cb1 cosmos the wind is warm as it brushes\cb3 \ \cb1 just gently against your cheeks\cb3 \ \cb1 standing here in the wilderness of these woods your shoulders begin to soften and drop\cb3 \ \cb1 this forest sanctuary comes to you as a refuge away from the weight of the world from all that you felt you\cb3 \ \cb1 needed to carry in the days up until now\cb3 \ \cb1 for these precious moments i invite you to grant yourself permission\cb3 \ \cb1 to let go to simply tune into what is right here\cb3 \ \cb1 and to open up to the possibility of deep release and\cb3 \ \cb1 inner peace\cb3 \ \cb1 as you grant yourself this permission you know that you don't need to force\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to feel any different than you do right now\cb3 \ \cb1 and furthermore know that opening up to inner peace\cb3 \ \cb1 does not mean that all of your outer world challenges will disappear\cb3 \ \cb1 however consider that there is a chance of finding respite beneath the\cb3 \ \cb1 waves of the worried mind\cb3 \ \cb1 know only that this peace and tranquility is possible opening your heart to the journey that\cb3 \ \cb1 guide you there\cb3 \ \cb1 now take a moment to feel into your body here in the forest as you witness yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 acclimatizing to your new environment perhaps you might see yourself stretch\cb3 \ \cb1 your arms up towards the sky or reaching down to the earth in\cb3 \ \cb1 reverence witness yourself moving in any way\cb3 \ \cb1 that helps to free up and release stagnant or anxious energy within your body\cb3 \ \cb1 eventually you returned to standing gazing down the trail stretched out\cb3 \ \cb1 before you the path ahead is whimsical weaving\cb3 \ \cb1 in and out of the old growth forest you take a long deep breath\cb3 \ \cb1 inhaling the forest air\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you exhale you begin on your way taking the trail mindful step\cb3 \ \cb1 by step\cb3 \ \cb1 as you go you absorb the beauty of the forest around you\cb3 \ \cb1 hummingbirds flitter through the air and squirrels and chipmunks jump from\cb3 \ \cb1 treetop to treetop\cb3 \ \cb1 ancient ferns rise up from the earth in their cosmic patterns and countless\cb3 \ \cb1 other species of plants and animals make themselves known to you in fact\cb3 \ \cb1 the diversity is beyond anything you've ever seen\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to explore the environment for yourself as you walk through it allow it to come\cb3 \ \cb1 to life with any plants animals or even insects\cb3 \ \cb1 that bring you a sense of peace and\cb3 \ \cb1 well-being\cb3 \ \cb1 consider the fact that your inner forest is completely unique to your own mind and imagination\cb3 \ \cb1 and bring it to life in any way that soothes you\cb3 \ \cb1 in other words plant your inner refuge as you please\cb3 \ \cb1 as you witness the peace that lives in this forest notice how a sense of ease grows inside\cb3 \ \cb1 of you notice your belly softening\cb3 \ \cb1 your limbs relaxing and your worried or controlling mind\cb3 \ \cb1 letting go even further breath\cb3 \ \cb1 by breath by breath\cb3 \ \cb1 simply just being in this forest provides you with something you it helps you to naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 and effortlessly begin the process of letting go\cb3 \ \cb1 now soften your gaze on the plants and animals of this forest\cb3 \ \cb1 as you focus once again on the trail ahead of you\cb3 \ \cb1 as you do you notice that this pathway ends just a few meters up ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 and where it does there is a small clearing in the woods\cb3 \ \cb1 you make your way towards the clearing which enchants your heart and mind\cb3 \ \cb1 completely it's surrounded by tall ancient trees\cb3 \ \cb1 with wild flowers lining the perimeter teal violet and fuchsia petals are in\cb3 \ \cb1 full bloom\cb3 \ \cb1 the soil in the clearing is bare but it's still rich and full of\cb3 \ \cb1 invisible energy and in the center of it a tiny nest of\cb3 \ \cb1 sorts has been laid out for you\cb3 \ \cb1 a persian rug is spread across the solid earth and on top of it plush cushions and\cb3 \ \cb1 blankets are scattered this human-like nest in the middle of\cb3 \ \cb1 the forest has your name on it and so you make yourself cozy within it\cb3 \ \cb1 as you come to rest your back on the soft rug in the middle of the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 wriggling your body to get comfortable you take a few deep breaths to settle in\cb3 \ \cb1 and softening your belly as you breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 with each breath in you embrace the vitality of the forest around you\cb3 \ \cb1 and with each outward breath you feel yourself melting a little bit further into the\cb3 \ \cb1 earth\cb3 \ \cb1 each breath brings you back to what is right here back to the peace that is possible when\cb3 \ \cb1 you connect with what is present\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue to breathe naturally as you gaze out at the world from the surface of the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 those majestic trees stand even taller with canopies that dance through the\cb3 \ \cb1 glistening sun the trees are alive you can feel\cb3 \ \cb1 their energy and you embrace their shelter their\cb3 \ \cb1 stability and their protection\cb3 \ \cb1 now gazing up at the canopy you see that there is enough open space\cb3 \ \cb1 for the sunlight to pour through as it does it blesses your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 not only does it offer you its warmth it offers ease and release as well\cb3 \ \cb1 to further soothe the mind you tune in more closely to the physical\cb3 \ \cb1 body as it rests beneath this glorious sun\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin by drawing your attention towards your crown\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling the golden light of this radiant star penetrating opening and softening the uppermost\cb3 \ \cb1 part of you\cb3 \ \cb1 this light begins to seep downwards relaxing all the muscles around your\cb3 \ \cb1 eyes it disarms the flow of any repetitive\cb3 \ \cb1 and unhelpful thought patterns\cb3 \ \cb1 you exhale to release surrendering your mind to the cleansing\cb3 \ \cb1 power of this light\cb3 \ \cb1 and then you feel the sun's rays inch further down filling and relaxing your jaw\cb3 \ \cb1 your tongue and your throat\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a long deep breath into this golden light\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling it ease any tension you've been carrying in and around this part of you\cb3 \ \cb1 still resting on the forest floor you feel into the sun's light as it\cb3 \ \cb1 enters your shoulders and then as it slowly seeps into your\cb3 \ \cb1 upper arms your elbows and lower arms\cb3 \ \cb1 and into your hands\cb3 \ \cb1 as this metallic yellow light fills you from shoulders to fingertips\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel your arms let go you feel them surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 you know that there is nothing you need to latch onto nothing you need to fix to grasp\cb3 \ \cb1 or to sort out you just grant your arms permission to\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 the light from your shoulders now enters into your upper torso\cb3 \ \cb1 your lower back melts it surrenders\cb3 \ \cb1 and your heart space opens up to the universal light that touches it\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe life force moves into and out of your heart with complete ease\cb3 \ \cb1 and then the golden light seeps even further downwards tracing the length of your spine\cb3 \ \cb1 until it lands in the center of your belly\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe here feel your belly filling with radiant\cb3 \ \cb1 sunlight it dissolves all tension\cb3 \ \cb1 all contraction and all worry\cb3 \ \cb1 helping you to breathe a little deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 at the same time your lower back begins to soften as well\cb3 \ \cb1 coming into deeper and deeper peace here in the forest where you rest\cb3 \ \cb1 you witness as the sun's glow enters your pelvic region now\cb3 \ \cb1 and as it does your hips begin to unknot\cb3 \ \cb1 tension begins to melt seeping into the earth beneath you for\cb3 \ \cb1 renewal\cb3 \ \cb1 and finally the golden light of the sun begins to inch its way down your legs\cb3 \ \cb1 first it fills your upper legs relaxing all of these muscles completely\cb3 \ \cb1 then it flows down to your knees into your calves and shins\cb3 \ \cb1 and eventually into your feet into each and every toe\cb3 \ \cb1 feel both of your legs surrendering with the support of the light shining down from above you\cb3 \ \cb1 waves of calm pulse through your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 follow them for a moment now witnessing them as currents of golden\cb3 \ \cb1 light ebbing and flowing from the top of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 to your toes and then from your toes to the top of\cb3 \ \cb1 your head and back again\cb3 \ \cb1 as this golden wave of calm rises up to your crown it eases your\cb3 \ \cb1 mind and connects you to everything around you\cb3 \ \cb1 and as it ebbs back towards your feet it grounds you deep into the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 providing you with a sense of strength and resilience\cb3 \ \cb1 the sun's rays continue to hold you as you tune into other elements of the forest now\cb3 \ \cb1 first you notice the sweet aroma that fills your nostrils as you breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 you absorb the aliveness of the forest with each full breath\cb3 \ \cb1 then your eyes trace the lengths of those remarkable trees\cb3 \ \cb1 which are firmly rooted calm and stable\cb3 \ \cb1 you admire the base of the trees and the intricate pattern of their bark\cb3 \ \cb1 and then your gaze rises up them noticing the complexity of branches that\cb3 \ \cb1 extend out from the solid stable core\cb3 \ \cb1 the leaves on those upper branches are diverse and varied even from down below you can\cb3 \ \cb1 see that some are round some are triangular and some\cb3 \ \cb1 are irregular like the leaves of the chestnut trees and the maples\cb3 \ \cb1 just together they dance seamlessly in the soft breeze\cb3 \ \cb1 occasionally you witness a leaf splitting from its branch\cb3 \ \cb1 and dancing down towards the earth you admire how effortlessly it lets go\cb3 \ \cb1 how naturally it surrenders\cb3 \ \cb1 as you gaze up at the leaves you realize how transient they are seasons come and seasons go\cb3 \ \cb1 and throughout the seasons the trees shed their leaves in order to be renewed\cb3 \ \cb1 and so you liken the leaves above you to the thoughts that come and go for seasons in your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 anxious or worried thoughts are just as transient as those delicate leaves that shimmer in\cb3 \ \cb1 the wind\cb3 \ \cb1 and so as you rest here beneath the canopy pair\cb3 \ \cb1 each falling leaf with an anxious ruminating or worried thought that you would like to release\cb3 \ \cb1 or soften\cb3 \ \cb1 as one of these thoughts come to mind see it falling towards the rich and\cb3 \ \cb1 fertile earth as a delicate leaf does at the end of its season\cb3 \ \cb1 as each leaf of anxiety or worry falls towards the earth something\cb3 \ \cb1 remarkable happens time appears to speed up in your mind's\cb3 \ \cb1 eye as you watch each fallen leaf transmute from vibrant green\cb3 \ \cb1 to deep red to dark rust and quickly as if you were watching\cb3 \ \cb1 time-lapsed film you observe each leaf decay becoming one with the\cb3 \ \cb1 bed of soil it rests on\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to watch this miraculous process of transformation on your own\cb3 \ \cb1 link each anxious thought with a falling leaf and as it arrives on the earth watch as\cb3 \ \cb1 alchemy takes over what begins as a worried delicate leaf\cb3 \ \cb1 fluttering in the wind of life is capable of transforming\cb3 \ \cb1 of becoming rich dense soil through the ever-present possibility of\cb3 \ \cb1 transformation\cb3 \ \cb1 remember that your body is a tool to facilitate release\cb3 \ \cb1 with each thought that surrenders to the earth allow the body to surrender as well\cb3 \ \cb1 by relaxing your body you encourage the mind to do the same\cb3 \ \cb1 any and all sorts of anxious thoughts can be processed in this way\cb3 \ \cb1 so long as the cause of your concern does not require urgent action in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 it's possible to tap into a sense of surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 and to let go of anxious thoughts does not mean we don't care about\cb3 \ \cb1 certain outcomes or that we are in denial of how we feel\cb3 \ \cb1 rather it's a simple recognition that the past cannot be returned to\cb3 \ \cb1 that the future is undetermined and that all we have is the present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment and in this present moment we can choose to open ourselves up\cb3 \ \cb1 to deeper peace\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue to rest on the forest floor bundled up as the sun moves behind the\cb3 \ \cb1 canopy now the air is still warm and so\cb3 \ \cb1 you are completely comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few more moments of silence to watch leaves of anxious thoughts fall\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the earth watch them quickly and effortlessly\cb3 \ \cb1 turn into dried leaves and then into soil itself\cb3 \ \cb1 your eyes are growing tired but you continue to absorb the tranquility of\cb3 \ \cb1 the world around you here amongst the plants\cb3 \ \cb1 insects and trees you realize that anxiety is not a concern\cb3 \ \cb1 the various beings that call this forest home simply go about their lives\cb3 \ \cb1 they know what needs to be done and they do it\cb3 \ \cb1 and the rest they leave\cb3 \ \cb1 an awareness grows within you that nature doesn't need to worry\cb3 \ \cb1 yes there are times when it must leap into action to protect itself\cb3 \ \cb1 but it doesn't over ruminate it doesn't\cb3 \ \cb1 overthink this recognition alone helps you to breathe deeper helps you to further surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 you come back to your breathing feeling the natural rhythm of this cycle\cb3 \ \cb1 moving through you just like the seasons the breath comes\cb3 \ \cb1 and it goes it comes\cb3 \ \cb1 and it goes\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel yourself surrendering deeper to this universal wisdom of the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 you realize that there is indeed an innate universal force that is holding you\cb3 \ \cb1 and supporting you you realize now that you do not need to\cb3 \ \cb1 do nor do you accomplish everything on your own\cb3 \ \cb1 and so if you'd like to i invite you now\cb3 \ \cb1 to ask the universal energy all around you for any support that you need for a\cb3 \ \cb1 final release\cb3 \ \cb1 in other words is there something that you are still struggling to let go of\cb3 \ \cb1 something that you need support with\cb3 \ \cb1 and if so turn towards the sky that seeps through the canopy overhead\cb3 \ \cb1 and ask for its wisdom for its support\cb3 \ \cb1 if you hear a wise voice offer its support to you\cb3 \ \cb1 know that not only does it come from the universe around you\cb3 \ \cb1 it comes simultaneously from inside your very own being\cb3 \ \cb1 you are the holder of the wisdom that you seek\cb3 \ \cb1 for a few more silent moments come back to the falling leaves\cb3 \ \cb1 let any thoughts that do not serve you be surrendered now\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the universe and your inherent wisdom to support you with this\cb3 \ \cb1 if it feels natural for you you might even tap into a sense of joy as you observe\cb3 \ \cb1 the falling leaves letting go doesn't always have to be\cb3 \ \cb1 difficult often there is joy in release\cb3 \ \cb1 now you can tell by the movement of shadows that the sun is beginning its final\cb3 \ \cb1 departure the forest appears to be preparing for a\cb3 \ \cb1 good night's rest animals have slowed their stirring\cb3 \ \cb1 butterflies have retreated for the night and all that remains in their place is\cb3 \ \cb1 near stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 as the earth slows down so do you\cb3 \ \cb1 the mind which had already experienced a sense of quiet tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 slows even further you are beginning to pass into the state\cb3 \ \cb1 between wakefulness and sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 but before you drift off completely you continue to take in the radiance of\cb3 \ \cb1 the world around you namely the colors in this evening sky\cb3 \ \cb1 first the sky illuminates with a soft clementine orange glow\cb3 \ \cb1 it doesn't quite reach the uppermost cosmos but the horizon casts its light\cb3 \ \cb1 through the surrounding trees this radiant orange light floats across\cb3 \ \cb1 your body granting you warmth and balance and vitality\cb3 \ \cb1 from head to toe you open yourself up to it completely\cb3 \ \cb1 soon the orange light in the sky begins to transmute\cb3 \ \cb1 electric magenta begins to shine through in its place\cb3 \ \cb1 as it covers your body it grants you a sense of childlike wonder\cb3 \ \cb1 magic and trust\cb3 \ \cb1 open your heart to this enchanting pink glow\cb3 \ \cb1 the light in the sky continues to shift soon the once pink glow\cb3 \ \cb1 becomes a deep mesmerizing violet\cb3 \ \cb1 a color associated with wisdom spiritual connection and the soothing of\cb3 \ \cb1 emotions you feel yourself coming into complete\cb3 \ \cb1 alignment as this violet light passes over you\cb3 \ \cb1 all of your cells all of your muscles your nerve endings\cb3 \ \cb1 and all of your organs are touched by this cleansing radiant light\cb3 \ \cb1 it fills your entire body from the tips of your toes to the crown\cb3 \ \cb1 of your head and as it fills your mind space\cb3 \ \cb1 it dispels any last ruminating thought patterns that may have been\cb3 \ \cb1 stubbornly holding on you don't need to bring them\cb3 \ \cb1 with you into the slumber ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 the dark violet color grows deeper soon becoming a midnight blue\cb3 \ \cb1 you can still make out the night sky against the black silhouette of trees overhead\cb3 \ \cb1 and through that empty space that exposes you to the cosmos\cb3 \ \cb1 the milky way begins to appear the thick blanket of stars is\cb3 \ \cb1 mesmerizing\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel completely safe and supported here in the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 somehow as the day has departed and the midnight hour creeps closer\cb3 \ \cb1 you have gained an embodied sense of belonging you feel a part of this forest\cb3 \ \cb1 a part of this entire earth and universe in fact\cb3 \ \cb1 and it is this deep sense of belonging that awakens your inner peace\cb3 \ \cb1 worried thoughts may still rise from time to time\cb3 \ \cb1 but you've gained a new perspective of them ear gazing out at the milky way\cb3 \ \cb1 you realize that in fact you are not looking out at the stars\cb3 \ \cb1 you are a part of them and being a part of the universe like\cb3 \ \cb1 this you are unconditionally supported through everything\cb3 \ \cb1 you are unconditionally loved\cb3 \ \cb1 sink into this deeper understanding of your belonging for a few long deep breaths\cb3 \ \cb1 if you'd like to you might want to release a soft sigh with each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 if any worries or anxious thoughts creep back know that you hold the power to release\cb3 \ \cb1 and to soften them just refrain from judging these thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 or pushing them away simply acknowledge them as a part of yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 that simply needs your love and compassion\cb3 \ \cb1 grant them your love let them know how strong you are\cb3 \ \cb1 and then allow these unhelpful thoughts just to fade away\cb3 \ \cb1 through the canopy above you catch side of the moon making itself known\cb3 \ \cb1 to the dark sky tonight it is a waning crescent moon\cb3 \ \cb1 fading into darkness day by day by day\cb3 \ \cb1 this waning moon offers a final reminder to surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 it invites you to make space by cleansing the old\cb3 \ \cb1 so that you may set new intentions and new belief systems to empower you in the days to come\cb3 \ \cb1 so as you gaze up at the radiant silver of the moon take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 consider what intention you'd like to set for the day that awaits you\cb3 \ \cb1 what qualities or ways of being would you like to harness while you\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep and carry into tomorrow\cb3 \ \cb1 once you have your intention silently repeat it to the moon\cb3 \ \cb1 three times\cb3 \ \cb1 release your words of intention when you've finished your third repetition and sinking back\cb3 \ \cb1 into the silent stillness of the evening forest\cb3 \ \cb1 feel back into your breath observing once again it's continual\cb3 \ \cb1 coming and going and as you breathe listen closely\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can hear the sound that it makes\cb3 \ \cb1 if you can hear it liken this sound to the soft flow of wind through a tranquil forest\cb3 \ \cb1 canopy like the one overhead of you now\cb3 \ \cb1 you close your eyes and once again you can feel your body being penetrated with soothing\cb3 \ \cb1 light energy this time it's not the sun it is the subtlety of\cb3 \ \cb1 the moon and so eyes closed to the forest around\cb3 \ \cb1 you you feel into the silver light of this moon\cb3 \ \cb1 first it weaves its way into the crown and headspace\cb3 \ \cb1 reminding you to let go again and again\cb3 \ \cb1 and again as many times as is needed\cb3 \ \cb1 it then ebbs its way into your cheeks your mouth and your throat\cb3 \ \cb1 helping to release your jaw and anything you've been clenching onto there\cb3 \ \cb1 you then feel the moon's glow moving into your shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 and as it does you release your shoulders into the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 words of the indian scholar and environmental activist vandana shiva come to mind\cb3 \ \cb1 you hear her whisper you are not atlas carrying the world on\cb3 \ \cb1 your shoulders it is good to remember that the planet is carrying you\cb3 \ \cb1 now the silver light seeps into the full lengths of your arms\cb3 \ \cb1 just as the sun did all those moments ago\cb3 \ \cb1 the silver light brings deep release to each of your muscles\cb3 \ \cb1 from those in your shoulders all the way down to your fingers\cb3 \ \cb1 let them go let each of those muscles surrender for\cb3 \ \cb1 the night\cb3 \ \cb1 you trace the silver light back up and into your chest now\cb3 \ \cb1 where it creates a sense of spaciousness\cb3 \ \cb1 your heart area illuminates with bright silver light and it grows with each\cb3 \ \cb1 inhalation if any thoughts arise from now on\cb3 \ \cb1 you can guide them into this luminescent heart for transformation\cb3 \ \cb1 now the silver thread of light weaves its way along your spine\cb3 \ \cb1 each vertebrae that it passes surrenders to the evening\cb3 \ \cb1 and eventually your stomach fills with this subtle silver glow\cb3 \ \cb1 and feel your breath as it moves into this space\cb3 \ \cb1 the silver glow expanding in your belly with each full breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and it softens all areas around your core\cb3 \ \cb1 front and back side to side\cb3 \ \cb1 this calming silver energy enters into your hips and pelvis\cb3 \ \cb1 bringing softness to this part of you one last time before sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 and then it weaves its way through your upper legs\cb3 \ \cb1 past your knees into your lower legs\cb3 \ \cb1 ending its journey at the tips of your toes\cb3 \ \cb1 just allow both legs to relax in their\cb3 \ \cb1 entirety take a few full breaths as you bathe in this silver light of the moon\cb3 \ \cb1 and if you find that there's any specific part of you that longs for a little more silver light energy\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your attention there let it fill to the brim with the light\cb3 \ \cb1 of the moon\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you are ready let the imagery of this silver light soften now\cb3 \ \cb1 the moon is still there high up in the night sky\cb3 \ \cb1 but you can shift your attention to any other anchor that feels soothing for you\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps you focus on the breath inhaling and exhaling the fresh\cb3 \ \cb1 nourishing air perhaps you focus on what it feels like\cb3 \ \cb1 to be held against the earth by gravity\cb3 \ \cb1 what it feels like for each part of your body to fully surrender each muscle to fully\cb3 \ \cb1 relax into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps you gaze up at the milky way at the tops of the trees\cb3 \ \cb1 or at some other point in nature that soothes and settles you\cb3 \ \cb1 just whatever brings you a sense of peace presence and well-being let that be your\cb3 \ \cb1 anchor for a short while longer\cb3 \ \cb1 and slowly now i invite you to release the imagery of the\cb3 \ \cb1 forest from your mind as you gently shift your awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 back to this physical reality\cb3 \ \cb1 keep your mind soft you've not physically gone anywhere and\cb3 \ \cb1 so you don't need to return you've always been here\cb3 \ \cb1 you've always been held by this space the entire time\cb3 \ \cb1 if you are still with me i trust that sleep will be coming soon for you\cb3 \ \cb1 between now and then use whatever anchor you please to keep your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 focused and your mind calm\cb3 \ \cb1 the peace and tranquility you experienced here tonight was not a product of anything outside of\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself it came from within\cb3 \ \cb1 remember this deeper truth anytime the mind seems to wander off on

of your fears at a\cb3 \ \cb1 deep level of understanding and\cb3 \ \cb1 forgiveness\cb3 \ \cb1 so take a moment to watch your\cb3 \ \cb1 reflection begin to shift forming itself\cb3 \ \cb1 into

begins to\cb3 \ \cb1 evaporate turning into a silver shimmery\cb3 \ \cb1 mist at the base of the cliff you hear\cb3 \ \cb1 faint strains of song out of the Mist\cb3 \ \cb1 emerge thousands of birds their feathers\cb3 \ \cb1 all the cars of the rainbow\cb3 \ \cb1 they fly up and into the sky above you\cb3 \ \cb1 swirling and dipping in an aerial dance\cb3 \ \cb1 of pure delight watch their patterns as\cb3 \ \cb1 they move across the sky and allow\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to realize that you yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 have transformed your fear and anxiety\cb3 \ \cb1 into this beautiful spectacle before\cb3 \ \cb1 your eyes listen to the birds jubilant\cb3 \ \cb1 song and watch the way they colored\cb3 \ \cb1 bodies flutter across the electric blue\cb3 \ \cb1 sky you have created this\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the birds make a huge lap through the\cb3 \ \cb1 valley a farewell signal to you

you\cb3 \ \cb1 turn around you realize it is the book\cb3 \ \cb1 from the library before your eyes it\cb3 \ \cb1 opens and the familiar sight of printed\cb3 \ \cb1 letters floods your vision lifting you\cb3 \ \cb1 from the warmth of the stone cliff the\cb3 \ \cb1 letters rush faster and faster then\cb3 \ \cb1 dissolve leaving you sitting back in the\cb3 \ \cb1 library the book resting on your

from meditation so let's drop everything associated with\cb3 \ \cb1 achieving anything and let's just simply call this a before sleep journey so\cb3 \ \cb1 right now we want to let go of all expectations and set out to achieve\cb3 \ \cb1 nothing just to simply be\cb3 \ \cb1 if we can just be we are on the path to peace of mind accepting all that is in\cb3 \ \cb1 this given moment so getting comfortable now wriggling around if necessary arms\cb3 \ \cb1 by your side feet relaxed and just let your feet part naturally as they choose\cb3 \ \cb1 to begin by closing your eyes and gently taking three deep breaths in through\cb3 \ \cb1 your nose and out through your mouth and on the breath in sending that breath all\cb3 \ \cb1 the way down to your lower belly area and feeling this area expand and as you\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe out feeling it deflate like a balloon that's releasing air\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and once you've done this returning your breath to a natural and comfortable rhythm breathing in and out through your\cb3 \ \cb1 nose [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now during this journey we're about to embark on together thoughts are going to\cb3 \ \cb1 come and go in fact

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello and welcome to this guided meditation this is the positive miracles\cb3 \ \cb1 guided sleep meditation I'm Jason Stephenson we're often told\cb3 \ \cb1 about the importance and power of being positive but knowing that we should be\cb3 \ \cb1 positive is one thing but actually being positive is another and when the day's\cb3 \ \cb1 stresses pile up and things don't work our way it's too easy to give in to our\cb3 \ \cb1 emotions and feel anything but positive and it makes it harder for us to go to\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep when this continues we sometimes give in to feelings of inadequacy believing that\cb3 \ \cb1 we're not good enough or worthy enough and never will be at the very worst we\cb3 \ \cb1 may begin to suspect that there's a vast conspiracy determined to foil us at every turn and thus cynics are born\cb3 \ \cb1 these perpetuate a terrible cycle they believe they're not good enough or that\cb3 \ \cb1 things will never work their way they therefore become blind to wonderful\cb3 \ \cb1 opportunities awaiting them at every corner thus reinforcing their own beliefs and this is the prison of\cb3 \ \cb1 negative thinking now this meditation is the antidote to such a prison the aim of\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation is to get you to sleep with miracles of positive and kind\cb3 \ \cb1 intentions so let's begin\cb3 \ \cb1 now for this one you can prepare as you would go into sleep lying down on your back or you can sit upright with your\cb3 \ \cb1 spine straight and this allows you to maintain an upright but comfortable position without strain to help you\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe more easily and maintain a good balance let your shoulders relax and\cb3 \ \cb1 rest your hands palms up on your lap or by your side if you are lying down this\cb3 \ \cb1 stabilizes you rolls your shoulders back and opens up your rib cage\cb3 \ \cb1 now facing straight ahead and pretend that you're the CEO of a major company\cb3 \ \cb1 or the ruler of a powerful country in your hands lies the fate of millions you\cb3 \ \cb1 are a very important person so project your power through your upright and\cb3 \ \cb1 confident but relaxed posture\cb3 \ \cb1 and because of who and what you are you have earned the right to just be for now\cb3 \ \cb1 all appointments meetings schedules and deadlines they can all wait but now they\cb3 \ \cb1 must take a back seat to what you are about to do so keeping your lips closed\cb3 \ \cb1 relax your jaw so that there's a gap between your teeth and rest the tip of\cb3 \ \cb1 your tongue against the back of your upper teeth gently close your eyes so\cb3 \ \cb1 your work can begin now please pay\cb3 \ \cb1 attention to your breathing and notice how it moves in and out of your body and\cb3 \ \cb1 how your body responds to it and that's breathing now in and out through your\cb3 \ \cb1 nose\cb3 \ \cb1 notice how your body feels a sense of expansion as you breathe in and how your\cb3 \ \cb1 body contracts as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 bring your focus now to your stomach and as you breathe in bring the breath here\cb3 \ \cb1 so that it bloats with each inhalation and as you exhale feel your stomach\cb3 \ \cb1 contract\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 so in a few more moments I'm going to direct your breath by asking you to inhale and to exhale to a slow count of\cb3 \ \cb1 three ready inhale one one-thousand two\cb3 \ \cb1 one-thousand three one-thousand exhale one one-thousand two one-thousand three\cb3 \ \cb1 one-thousand inhale 1 2 3 exhale 1 2 3\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale now trying to keep this pattern of\cb3 \ \cb1 slower breathing for the remainder of this meditation just slowing it down\cb3 \ \cb1 naturally you don't have to mentally count each breath but just seeing if you can keep it nice and slow and steady\cb3 \ \cb1 maintain your focus on breathing into your stomach so it expands with each\cb3 \ \cb1 in-breath and contracts with each out breath you can visualize that your\cb3 \ \cb1 stomach is a balloon that grows and shrinks with each inhalation and\cb3 \ \cb1 exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 you still maintaining the pace of your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath think back to an incident where you put a smile on someone's face now\cb3 \ \cb1 you don't have to remember their names all that matters is that you made someone happy and that you did it with\cb3 \ \cb1 no thought of getting something back it\cb3 \ \cb1 doesn't have to be something major it could be something as simple as holding the door open for someone or giving a\cb3 \ \cb1 child a piece of candy or offering someone a sincere compliment that made\cb3 \ \cb1 their day\cb3 \ \cb1 now if several incidents come to mind pick the one where the recipient of your\cb3 \ \cb1 kindness expressed a genuine gratitude can you remember what they said or what\cb3 \ \cb1 they did just dwell in that memory for a\cb3 \ \cb1 few moments and try to recall as much detail as you can\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] do you remember how you felt in that\cb3 \ \cb1 moment did the other person's reaction\cb3 \ \cb1 surprised you maybe it made you feel good\cb3 \ \cb1 maintain your even breathing but just keep that memory and enjoy the feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 I'd like you now to remember a time when someone did you a kind Act\cb3 \ \cb1 preferably one that you so badly needed but never expected\cb3 \ \cb1 now again you don't have to know the person's name or even remember the details of their face just try to recall\cb3 \ \cb1 as much of the incident as you can did\cb3 \ \cb1 it happen at night or during the day what happened just before the person or\cb3 \ \cb1 persons came along did you ask for help or did they just volunteer to help what\cb3 \ \cb1 did they do to help you\cb3 \ \cb1 do you remember how you felt in that moment did you feel surprised grateful\cb3 \ \cb1 did you express your gratitude if so how\cb3 \ \cb1 did it make you feel valued noticed no longer invisible that there are indeed\cb3 \ \cb1 good people in the world just take a moment to explore that memory and to\cb3 \ \cb1 relive what you felt\cb3 \ \cb1 still maintaining the slow even pace of your breath I'd like you to consider the\cb3 \ \cb1 following thought the gratitude you've felt toward another was the same\cb3 \ \cb1 gratitude that another felt toward you it might be a feeling of lightness and\cb3 \ \cb1 peace one where the world seemed right even if only for a moment but the person\cb3 \ \cb1 to whom you were kind they too felt what you are now feeling that the world\cb3 \ \cb1 seemed right because they were good and kind people in it people like you no\cb3 \ \cb1 matter what your situation is like no matter the state of your finances or\cb3 \ \cb1 relationships no matter the state of your health or the demands on your time\cb3 \ \cb1 and attention this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you if you\cb3 \ \cb1 but hold on to it no matter how much or\cb3 \ \cb1 how little you have no matter your state of mind or how you feel this power to be\cb3 \ \cb1 good and kind can never be taken from you if you hold on to it no matter what\cb3 \ \cb1 your country's social political or economic situation is like and how it\cb3 \ \cb1 affects you this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you you\cb3 \ \cb1 hold on to it by understanding that this is your innate nature that's why it\cb3 \ \cb1 feels so good because it's your default State this is how you came into the\cb3 \ \cb1 world and how you may have spent the first years of your life until you grew older and forgot your true nature\cb3 \ \cb1 you are not your gender nor your sexuality nor your job nor your economic status nor your nationality or political\cb3 \ \cb1 affiliation you are yourself a being filled with love with light with peace\cb3 \ \cb1 and joy you are a person who seeks\cb3 \ \cb1 happiness and miracles and wants it for others as well because you know that\cb3 \ \cb1 this is the default State for everyone your pain is the result of knowing this\cb3 \ \cb1 truth but seeing another that's why you\cb3 \ \cb1 come alive when someone shows you kindness because it reminds you of their\cb3 \ \cb1 innate nature and that's why you feel powerful and validated when you show\cb3 \ \cb1 kindness to another because it is a reminder of your own innate nature you\cb3 \ \cb1 may not be the CEO of a major company or the ruler of a powerful country but you\cb3 \ \cb1 have a power similar to theirs the power to change the lives of others and it\cb3 \ \cb1 begins with one thought that I am good and therefore have the power to\cb3 \ \cb1 demonstrate the goodness or to withhold it it begins with one act the power to\cb3 \ \cb1 sit or stand up straight and undefeated confident in understanding of your own\cb3 \ \cb1 innate goodness finally it projects itself with one\cb3 \ \cb1 simple but sincere smile one that makes you feel good and because you feel good\cb3 \ \cb1 you pass that feeling on to another changing another's day for the better by\cb3 \ \cb1 making them feel the same and when another person feels good they\cb3 \ \cb1 pass on that feeling on to another who passes it on to another and so on\cb3 \ \cb1 continuing a chain reaction that began with you so you do have a tremendous\cb3 \ \cb1 power one that could potentially affect millions and indeed change the world for\cb3 \ \cb1 the better knowing this you cannot possibly be as\cb3 \ \cb1 helpless or as powerless as you have let yourself believe understanding this you\cb3 \ \cb1 can live each day with an upright posture a kind smile upon your face and\cb3 \ \cb1 creating miracles there are millions out there whose dahi depends on you and\cb3 \ \cb1 because their day depends on you so do their lives and the lives of others let\cb3 \ \cb1 go of your limitations and accept your own power and responsibility to shape\cb3 \ \cb1 the world into a better and more positive place it first begins with you\cb3 \ \cb1 rest well my friend rest well and go out\cb3 \ \cb1 create miracles change your life and at the same time changing the lives of\cb3 \ \cb1 others [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 that will help you to fall asleep quickly and effortlessly\cb3 \ \cb1 after a brief journey through the body we will take a trip into the cosmos\cb3 \ \cb1 during which you will fall asleep swiftly held beneath the soft glow of the moon\cb3 \ \cb1 and the stars allow the words of this meditation to\cb3 \ \cb1 flow effortlessly through you there is nothing you need to hold on to\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to surrender into slumber at any point during this practice\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] now to begin ensure that all end-of-day\cb3 \ \cb1 activities are taken care of your blind should be drawn any required\cb3 \ \cb1 alarms should be set\cb3 \ \cb1 and all lights turned off or shut out so that your body knows it's time to\cb3 \ \cb1 rest deeply\cb3 \ \cb1 eyes closed take a moment to land in the space that holds you\cb3 \ \cb1 making any necessary adjustments to your posture for extra comfort\cb3 \ \cb1 let your neck form one straight line with your spine as all muscles soften into the bed\cb3 \ \cb1 or other surface beneath you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 turn your attention towards the breath as you spend a few moments grounding through this force of life\cb3 \ \cb1 that gently ebbs and flows through your body\cb3 \ \cb1 as you watch your breath know that there is nothing it needs to do in no\cb3 \ \cb1 particular way it needs to flow our breath contains a wisdom that knows\cb3 \ \cb1 just how to support and nourish us all that is required is that we\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly step out of its way by easing the mind and relaxing the body\cb3 \ \cb1 as we move through this practice know that you can come back to the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 any time you need to anchor yourself back into the present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath your physical body and these words all serve that purpose\cb3 \ \cb1 each invite you to come back down into the sweet simplicity of this night\cb3 \ \cb1 now let's take a moment to travel through the body softening each part that our awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 moves through begin now by drawing your attention to\cb3 \ \cb1 the crown of your head holding your awareness there for a few\cb3 \ \cb1 moments [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 imagine this uppermost part of your body softening and a process that trickles down slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 to ease your forehead\cb3 \ \cb1 your eyebrows\cb3 \ \cb1 and your temples\cb3 \ \cb1 let your entire top half of your head relax releasing all physical and mental\cb3 \ \cb1 tension it might be holding\cb3 \ \cb1 and then slowly let this softening seep into your cheekbones and your jaw\cb3 \ \cb1 your mouth and your tongue\cb3 \ \cb1 as your awareness gently descends further it brings softness to your neck and your\cb3 \ \cb1 shoulders helping them to release any weight they may have carried throughout the day\cb3 \ \cb1 and then envision that softening trickling down your arms relaxing each and every cell\cb3 \ \cb1 all the way to your fingertips\cb3 \ \cb1 returning your attention to your heart space now allow your chest to relax and your upper\cb3 \ \cb1 back as well\cb3 \ \cb1 and then slowly scan the length of your spine downwards inviting all tissues and muscles that\cb3 \ \cb1 surround it to surrender deeper into this night\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention centers itself in the belly now and let all muscles around your core\cb3 \ \cb1 relax as the belly rises and falls with each\cb3 \ \cb1 breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and then allow your awareness to soften the hips the pelvis and the buttocks\cb3 \ \cb1 before gently trickling down the legs softening each muscle completely until arriving at\cb3 \ \cb1 the tips of your toes\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hold your entire body in your awareness letting it surrender completely into the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 you might notice a heaviness within your body as well as a lightness the sense that\cb3 \ \cb1 your body has given up completely to the weight of gravity while at the\cb3 \ \cb1 same time feeling entirely free and weightless\cb3 \ \cb1 let yourself revel in that sensation for a few breaths now\cb3 \ \cb1 the feeling of being held by gravity while also freely floating within the\cb3 \ \cb1 airy cosmic universe\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 in just a moment we will begin a journey into the stars\cb3 \ \cb1 floating gracefully away from the earth yet before we do so\cb3 \ \cb1 let's take a moment to realize where we are truly headed and that is into a deep and restorative\cb3 \ \cb1 slumber so before we begin our ascension into the cosmos\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to silently repeat i let go\cb3 \ \cb1 let go\cb3 \ \cb1 i let go\cb3 \ \cb1 surrendering completely to the weightlessness of [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 in your mind's eye as your body and mind become lighter i invite you to envision\cb3 \ \cb1 that you are resting in an open meadow beneath the starry sky\cb3 \ \cb1 a soft blanket of grass rests beneath you your body is kept warm amidst the summer\cb3 \ \cb1 air\cb3 \ \cb1 the breeze whistles in the leaves of nearby trees rustling through tall grasses as well\cb3 \ \cb1 the night sky is onyx black reflecting darkness into your eyes but\cb3 \ \cb1 for the dazzling stars and crescent moon above you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the world is quiet around and within you\cb3 \ \cb1 you inhale the evening air filling yourself up with the airy cosmos\cb3 \ \cb1 you are a part of\cb3 \ \cb1 each breath in brings a lightness to your body [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and each breath out helps you to let go to surrender to the sky above\cb3 \ \cb1 and around you\cb3 \ \cb1 as your body gets lighter you notice the earth beneath you drifting away\cb3 \ \cb1 suddenly you are light enough to be untouched by the weight of gravity your\cb3 \ \cb1 body rising above the ground and into the night sky\cb3 \ \cb1 you are not afraid you know you are protected here so\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender to the process you are in allowing yourself to be carried away\cb3 \ \cb1 from the earth and into the stars\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 your body floats higher and higher passing through thin veils of cloud\cb3 \ \cb1 that grace the atmosphere\cb3 \ \cb1 the air around you is quiet as is your mind space\cb3 \ \cb1 up here amidst the clouds and beneath the light of the moon\cb3 \ \cb1 nothing of your life on earth seems to matter\cb3 \ \cb1 all that matters is this miraculous open space you drift through\cb3 \ \cb1 drifting further away from the earth you take a moment to look down upon it\cb3 \ \cb1 the entire globe is in full view the atmosphere around it dark and\cb3 \ \cb1 peaceful and twinkling lights shine back at you\cb3 \ \cb1 as if mimicking the stars\cb3 \ \cb1 no sounds of the earth can be heard from where you are no traffic\cb3 \ \cb1 no wind no moving water\cb3 \ \cb1 you are miles away now [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 your entire body floats higher still and as it does the stars become\cb3 \ \cb1 larger and brighter [Music] your eyes land on one star in particular\cb3 \ \cb1 and everything else seems to melt away\cb3 \ \cb1 you spend some time with this star whispering your intentions for the\cb3 \ \cb1 coming day and inviting it to support you in surrendering to the night\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath is still soft nourishing you as you float high above the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 you take one last moment to commune with your favorite star before letting your attention widen to\cb3 \ \cb1 all the other celestial bodies that find their home within the sky\cb3 \ \cb1 planets comets and shooting stars all come into view as you gaze into the\cb3 \ \cb1 abyss of the cosmos still you know you are held\cb3 \ \cb1 safe by the universe here you are calm peaceful\cb3 \ \cb1 and entirely at ease [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you consider all the constellations that are spread out before you\cb3 \ \cb1 indeed they look different from this higher vantage point their patterns not so easily\cb3 \ \cb1 observed this close up and yet you reflect upon some of your\cb3 \ \cb1 favorites orion libra\cb3 \ \cb1 capricorn and aquarius\cb3 \ \cb1 now that you are here in the realm of all the constellations [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you understand why ancient traditions and cultures have long held up these celestial\cb3 \ \cb1 formations the closer you get to them the more\cb3 \ \cb1 remarkable they come the more they enchant your mind heart\cb3 \ \cb1 and soul\cb3 \ \cb1 come back to your breath with full awareness now inhaling and exhaling deeply\cb3 \ \cb1 your body remains light and free as you drift through the cosmos\cb3 \ \cb1 reveling at the stars\cb3 \ \cb1 now like a feather gliding through the air slowly and steadily\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel your body slowly coming back down\cb3 \ \cb1 some magic mysterious force holds you supporting you as you move\cb3 \ \cb1 gracefully away from the realm of planets stars and the moon\cb3 \ \cb1 you do not return to the earth just yet though with grace you land gently\cb3 \ \cb1 upon a plush supportive cloud\cb3 \ \cb1 you release a deep sigh as you sink into this cosmic cushion letting it support you\cb3 \ \cb1 from head to toe\cb3 \ \cb1 as you rest here you find stillness [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you gaze up at the mystery of the atmosphere above you eyes landing on the silver of the moon\cb3 \ \cb1 that is transitioning through its waning face\cb3 \ \cb1 in a few nights from now it will become a dark and dazzling new moon\cb3 \ \cb1 and yet for now it is waning\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly growing smaller at a rate too slow for the human eye to catch in a\cb3 \ \cb1 single moment you consider the energy of the waning\cb3 \ \cb1 moon remembering that this particular lunar transition\cb3 \ \cb1 is a time for releasing slowing down surrendering and\cb3 \ \cb1 restoring now is the time to sink into non-doing\cb3 \ \cb1 to let yourself be exactly as you are\cb3 \ \cb1 perched on a cloud you take three full breaths each inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 lasting to a count of four and each exhale being a little bit longer\cb3 \ \cb1 lasting to a count of six inhaling for\cb3 \ \cb1 four and exhaling for six\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you finish one more breath this way\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing your exhale to cleanse you of any residual tension or weight you may be\cb3 \ \cb1 unconsciously holding\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 your body is relaxed your mind is relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 and you are ready to completely surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 you take one more moment to gaze up at the night sky from this height\cb3 \ \cb1 you thank it for all that it has illuminated within you\cb3 \ \cb1 and then slowly you drift like a feather once again\cb3 \ \cb1 inching your way closer towards the solid earth\cb3 \ \cb1 as you make your final approach held through this transition by a gentle and mysterious\cb3 \ \cb1 force you count down from ten to let go more completely\cb3 \ \cb1 ten your mind is quiet held in the silence of the night\cb3 \ \cb1 nine your body is relaxed fully trusting of the universe that\cb3 \ \cb1 supports it\cb3 \ \cb1 eight your heart is open awake to the mystery and beauty\cb3 \ \cb1 of the world\cb3 \ \cb1 seven your shoulders surrender the weight of the world having been\cb3 \ \cb1 freed from them\cb3 \ \cb1 six your jaw is relaxed knowing there is nothing that needs to\cb3 \ \cb1 be expressed\cb3 \ \cb1 five your hands are free free of any desire to grasp attain\cb3 \ \cb1 or achieve\cb3 \ \cb1 4. your legs are relaxed knowing there is nowhere they need to\cb3 \ \cb1 carry you\cb3 \ \cb1 three your soul is at peace pleased with the journey it has just embarked on\cb3 \ \cb1 two your eyes and eyebrows are softened knowing there is nothing\cb3 \ \cb1 left to be seen\cb3 \ \cb1 one your entire body is aligned feeling fully prepared to take the next\cb3 \ \cb1 journey into slumber\cb3 \ \cb1 zero your body grounds back down gently slowly coming into contact\cb3 \ \cb1 with the earth once again\cb3 \ \cb1 as the journey through the stars is now but a memory\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to let all visuals disappear from your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 as you come back to the felt experience of being held by the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 from head to toe every part of your miraculous body surrenders your mental\cb3 \ \cb1 and emotional body to sink into a soft and tranquil stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 connected once again to the physical earth that supports you you revel in the sensation of being both\cb3 \ \cb1 heavy and light simultaneously\cb3 \ \cb1 feel gratitude for the force of gravity re-tethering you to the beautiful and\cb3 \ \cb1 solid earth beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 and deep appreciation for the mysterious enchanted realm of the cosmos\cb3 \ \cb1 for the lightness illumination and the magic it offers\cb3 \ \cb1 just allow your breath to flow through you with ease once again\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly allowing it to guide you into the final stage of surrender for the night\cb3 \ \cb1 with each exhale you let go you let go\cb3 \ \cb1 you let go\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep well my friend sleep well\cb3 \ \cb1 so\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3

settle\cb3 \ \cb1 in\cb3 \ \cb1 to let go of its attachment to the past\cb3 \ \cb1 or\cb3 \ \cb1 its ideas about the future\cb3 \ \cb1 you can help it to arrive by simply\cb3 \ \cb1 tuning into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 noting what it feels like to be held by\cb3 \ \cb1 gravity\cb3 \ \cb1 against the floor or the chair below you\cb3 \ \cb1 once you feel firmly grounded and\cb3 \ \cb1 connected to the earth beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 just let your attention shift gently\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 without looking for anything in\cb3 \ \cb1 particular in the breath's flow\cb3 \ \cb1 simply observe its movement\cb3 \ \cb1 into and out of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 you might notice the temperature of the\cb3 \ \cb1 surrounding air\cb3 \ \cb1 as it enters your nostrils\cb3 \ \cb1 or the feeling of the body expanding\cb3 \ \cb1 and contracting with each breath cycle\cb3 \ \cb1 if you notice the mind wandering at any\cb3 \ \cb1 point\cb3 \ \cb1 simply notice this movement with\cb3 \ \cb1 patience\cb3 \ \cb1 curiosity and compassion\cb3 \ \cb1 and note that it's entirely natural for\cb3 \ \cb1 the mind to wander so practice\cb3 \ \cb1 non-judgment when you notice that this\cb3 \ \cb1 is occurring\cb3 \ \cb1 just silently invite your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 back to the breath when you notice that\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts have pulled\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention away\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now i invite you to let your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 and your awareness broaden to hold your\cb3 \ \cb1 entire physical body\cb3 \ \cb1 within the scope of its lens\cb3 \ \cb1 notice what it feels like to be here\cb3 \ \cb1 to fully occupy your physical being in\cb3 \ \cb1 this\cb3 \ \cb1 moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 just as was the case when you observe\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing unusual or particular\cb3 \ \cb1 you need to look for\cb3 \ \cb1 tuning into the body is a process of\cb3 \ \cb1 simply\cb3 \ \cb1 connecting with the subtle sensations of\cb3 \ \cb1 being alive\cb3 \ \cb1 you might notice tingling tension\cb3 \ \cb1 contraction or expansion\cb3 \ \cb1 or even numbness or any other barely\cb3 \ \cb1 traceable sensations just\cb3 \ \cb1 simply notice what is here inside of you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now let your attention focus in on a\cb3 \ \cb1 single sensation\cb3 \ \cb1 you may have come to observe\cb3 \ \cb1 if nothing has stood out to you simply\cb3 \ \cb1 let your awareness land on either\cb3 \ \cb1 the heart space or your third eye area\cb3 \ \cb1 just in the middle of your brows\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever point of the body your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention has landed on\cb3 \ \cb1 i invite you just to stay with that\cb3 \ \cb1 notice what is there and\cb3 \ \cb1 even if that feels like numbness or\cb3 \ \cb1 emptiness\cb3 \ \cb1 just notice be with it\cb3 \ \cb1 and refrain from judging any sensations\cb3 \ \cb1 as\cb3 \ \cb1 good or bad just watch with openness\cb3 \ \cb1 and just see what happens\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if or when the sensation dissolves just\cb3 \ \cb1 gently\cb3 \ \cb1 shift your focus to another single point\cb3 \ \cb1 in the body\cb3 \ \cb1 alternatively you can stay exactly where\cb3 \ \cb1 you are\cb3 \ \cb1 continuing to be present with that\cb3 \ \cb1 original\cb3 \ \cb1 point of interest\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now i invite you to consider\cb3 \ \cb1 is there any part of your body that\cb3 \ \cb1 might be yearning for\cb3 \ \cb1 some love or attention\cb3 \ \cb1 and let your attention on that place\cb3 \ \cb1 or stay where it is at the present\cb3 \ \cb1 and then imagine as if you are breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 nourishing energy into that part of your\cb3 \ \cb1 body with each breath\cb3 \ \cb1 so with each inhalation you might\cb3 \ \cb1 envision a gold\cb3 \ \cb1 healing light being sent to that\cb3 \ \cb1 area of your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 and with each breath out you might\cb3 \ \cb1 envision that same light\cb3 \ \cb1 carrying away any tension or stagnant\cb3 \ \cb1 energy\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale loving energy to nurture this\cb3 \ \cb1 single point in your physical body\cb3 \ \cb1 and exhale all tension away\cb3 \ \cb1 now i invite you to broaden your\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness once again\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly expanding your attention to hold\cb3 \ \cb1 your entire physical body\cb3 \ \cb1 and then continue to inhale those loving\cb3 \ \cb1 breaths or that golden light\cb3 \ \cb1 letting each breath nurture every cell\cb3 \ \cb1 of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 just imagine that your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 each cell each muscle and each organ\cb3 \ \cb1 is breathing in and out\cb3 \ \cb1 now soften your forehead\cb3 \ \cb1 relax your belly\cb3 \ \cb1 and then slowly let all visuals fade as\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 come back to the natural flow\cb3 \ \cb1 of your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and ground yourself once again in the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you were ready to close this\cb3 \ \cb1 practice slowly open your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you move through your day\cb3 \ \cb1 remember that you can always come back\cb3 \ \cb1 to the immediate sensations of your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath and\cb3 \ \cb1 body to find peace presence\cb3 \ \cb1 and grounding thanks for joining me\cb3 \ \cb1 today\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \ \cb1 English

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome to the deserving and manifesting\cb3 \ \cb1 abundance guided meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 it is the innate tendency of nature to\cb3 \ \cb1 grow and become more to produce more and\cb3 \ \cb1 create more of everything there are\cb3 \ \cb1 always babies being born new trees\cb3 \ \cb1 sprouting new plants growing new things\cb3 \ \cb1 are constantly being invented cars\cb3 \ \cb1 produced houses being built jobs created\cb3 \ \cb1 and new technologies being developed on\cb3 \ \cb1 a daily basis all around us the universe\cb3 \ \cb1 is always expanding and growing just as\cb3 \ \cb1 abundance is everywhere in the universe\cb3 \ \cb1 it can also appear in your personal life\cb3 \ \cb1 if you intend it and allow it to be\cb3 \ \cb1 you may not feel you have access to this\cb3 \ \cb1 abundance you may think you a li innate\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself from it and prevent it from\cb3 \ \cb1 manifesting in your life well it's time\cb3 \ \cb1 to change that\cb3 \ \cb1 tract abundance into your life you need\cb3 \ \cb1 to feel abundant you must believe you\cb3 \ \cb1 are worthy and deserving of great\cb3 \ \cb1 abundance you have to develop an\cb3 \ \cb1 abundance consciousness abundance\cb3 \ \cb1 consciousness means becoming aware of\cb3 \ \cb1 the existence of abundance of feeling it\cb3 \ \cb1 in your life and of connecting with it\cb3 \ \cb1 even if it doesn't seem to be a part of\cb3 \ \cb1 your life at this moment this kind of\cb3 \ \cb1 consciousness means feeling and\cb3 \ \cb1 believing that you are a part of it you\cb3 \ \cb1 are surrounded by it\cb3 \ \cb1 abundance lives within you intending it\cb3 \ \cb1 and releasing it out into the universe\cb3 \ \cb1 is all we need to begin with abundance\cb3 \ \cb1 consciousness breaks through the\cb3 \ \cb1 limiting beliefs of your mind and opens\cb3 \ \cb1 you to wider opportunities and a wider\cb3 \ \cb1 point of view\cb3 \ \cb1 so now let's get comfortable and allow\cb3 \ \cb1 ourselves the time and space to relax\cb3 \ \cb1 and manifest abundance in our lives\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 so finding a comfortable place either\cb3 \ \cb1 sitting or lying down\cb3 \ \cb1 that you won't be disturbed for the next\cb3 \ \cb1 20 minutes or so and closing your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 your arms can be placed beside you\cb3 \ \cb1 and begin this meditation by taking in\cb3 \ \cb1 three deep breaths in through the nose\cb3 \ \cb1 sending that breath all the way down\cb3 \ \cb1 and releasing it letting it go feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 that breath rise all the way up and out\cb3 \ \cb1 and return your breathing back to normal\cb3 \ \cb1 change it\cb3 \ \cb1 just being aware of it\cb3 \ \cb1 in feeling that stomach expand as you\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in\cb3 \ \cb1 breath out feel your stomach contract\cb3 \ \cb1 just be in this moment and be aware of\cb3 \ \cb1 this breathing for a few moments and I\cb3 \ \cb1 will return if a thought arises during\cb3 \ \cb1 this time simply go back to focusing on\cb3 \ \cb1 your breathing it's all okay it's a part\cb3 \ \cb1 of the process of meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you begin to relax now I'd like you\cb3 \ \cb1 to visualize laying beside you an\cb3 \ \cb1 envelope with a golden wax seal stamped\cb3 \ \cb1 with an ornate letter a written upon it\cb3 \ \cb1 you lift this up and gently break the\cb3 \ \cb1 seal and open the flap\cb3 \ \cb1 inside is an invitation addressed to you\cb3 \

go\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to move out of the thinking patterns and bring your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention to your felt experience\cb3 \ \cb1 no need to attach words or labels to your feelings simply explore what those\cb3 \ \cb1 feelings are pause and allow these feelings\cb3 \ \cb1 give yourself permission to be with this experience let your thoughts come and go\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if you find your mind drifting going back to old patterns of thinking or\cb3 \ \cb1 overthinking lovingly come back gesture\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention to come back to the present moment sensations once more\cb3 \ \cb1 being present is the way\cb3 \ \cb1 stay in the moment stay with the feelings and be okay with it\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to make space in your heart for these feelings to come up and simply be\cb3 \ \cb1 stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 longer\cb3 \ \cb1 as you continue this relaxed inward awareness become aware of any thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 arising witness them as if you are\cb3 \ \cb1 witnessing a flowing river of thoughts see them surface flow by and disappear\cb3 \ \cb1 each breath cycle Rises and is released\cb3 \ \cb1 similarly our thoughts rise and are then\cb3 \ \cb1 released let this idea this knowledge be\cb3 \ \cb1 a comfort to you to allow your thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 to drift down the flowing river of thoughts as you observe them as you let\cb3 \ \cb1 your thoughts come and go\cb3 \ \cb1 you may find it helpful to name these thoughts as they arise identify them as\cb3 \ \cb1 a way to simply be aware of thinking\cb3 \ \cb1 after they have been named witness them as one drop of water in the flowing\cb3 \ \cb1 river of thoughts moving with each of the other thoughts rising and falling\cb3 \ \cb1 and

\cb1 your felt experience\cb3 \ \cb1 let your thoughts come and go\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] if we resist the current of the flowing\cb3 \ \cb1 river of thoughts it will continue to rush against us pushing in opposition\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps giving you the feeling of being stuck\cb3 \ \cb1 if we accept it allow it we drift\cb3 \ \cb1 effortlessly along with the current\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the awareness of your thoughts allows\cb3 \ \cb1 you to let go of the hold they may have on you continue noticing your thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 as they arise and allow them to drift away\cb3 \ \cb1 you may even notice your thoughts coming with more space between them when you practice allowing them to rise\cb3 \ \cb1 and fall as with the cycle of the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 if you find you get swept up with a thought with compassion and patience\cb3 \ \cb1 bring your awareness back to the sensations of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 now allow yourself to go deeper still\cb3 \ \cb1 allow all of the thoughts to go\cb3 \ \cb1 let your scanning awareness drift off simply be present with your truest self\cb3 \ \cb1 letting all the layers of yourself dissolve let what seemed like boundaries\cb3 \ \cb1 blur\cb3 \ \cb1 since a place inside of you that is the place of your inner wisdom your\cb3 \ \cb1 intuition here inside you is where your\cb3 \ \cb1 present awareness and insights reside\cb3 \ \cb1 when you pause and simply be your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 stops and you open into expansiveness\cb3 \ \cb1 open into spaciousness [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment now to open yourself up and be receptive to whatever you find\cb3 \

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello and welcome to this loving-kindness meditation prior to sleep my name is Jason Stevenson and I\cb3 \ \cb1 will be taking you on this journey though this meditation was originally\cb3 \ \cb1 used in Buddhism you don't have to be a Buddhist to make it work for you nor do\cb3 \ \cb1 you have to subscribe to any religion or belief in Supernatural love and kindness\cb3 \ \cb1 are wonderful things but often we feel anything but sometimes it's easier to\cb3 \ \cb1 feel anger and hate but author Jonathan Lockwood who he also\cb3 \ \cb1 known as the philosopher of happiness put it best when he said forgive others\cb3 \ \cb1 not because they deserve your forgiveness but because you deserve peace now unfortunately that's often\cb3 \ \cb1 easier said than done but fortunately this meditation can help you so let's\cb3 \ \cb1 begin so please sitting upright but comfortably so if you'd like to rest\cb3 \ \cb1 your back against something that's fine just don't slouch or lean back because doing so will affect your breathing and\cb3 \ \cb1 if you want to lie down and do this before you drift off to sleep that's okay to just rest your hands palms face\cb3 \ \cb1 up on your lap or or by your side if you're lying down now close your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 and focus on your breathing it's alright if thoughts and images come in so long\cb3 \ \cb1 as you keep most of your attention on your breath you're doing fine when you see a thought\cb3 \ \cb1 allow it to be don't try and push it down but you simply shift your focus\cb3 \ \cb1 back to your breathing I want you to remember a time when you\cb3 \ \cb1 did a kind thing for someone it doesn't have to be dramatic but I have two\cb3 \ \cb1 conditions the first is that you did it without a thought of a reward or an\cb3 \ \cb1 influence to that person and the second is that you didn't later regret what you\cb3 \ \cb1 did just reflecting on that do you remember how it felt did it feel good\cb3 \ \cb1 did you feel proud of yourself did it bring a smile to your face\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if you're smiling now that's all good that feeling stems from a core goodness\cb3 \ \cb1 within yourself now I want you to try to remember what you looked like as a child\cb3 \ \cb1 the younger the better that child you\cb3 \ \cb1 were for all their faults and mischievousness deserved patience and\cb3 \ \cb1 understanding that child you were also deserved loved could you see yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 wanting to protect and provide for that child\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 could you see yourself wanting to hold and comfort that child just explore this\cb3 \ \cb1 thought for a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you you\cb3 \ \cb1 now if you can just mentally repeat after me for all the ways that I harm\cb3 \ \cb1 myself negate doubt belittle myself\cb3 \ \cb1 judge or be unkind to myself through my\cb3 \ \cb1 own confusions I forgive myself and if\cb3 \ \cb1 there is a situation I am not yet ready to forgive I forgive myself for that too\cb3 \ \cb1 may I feel loving-kindness may I be\cb3 \ \cb1 filled with loving-kindness may I be\cb3 \ \cb1 held in loving kindness may I be happy\cb3 \ \cb1 and peaceful may I appreciate the gift\cb3 \ \cb1 of just being alive\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] I'd like you now to bring to mind someone you love dearly it could be a\cb3 \ \cb1 parent a child a friend or even someone who's passed away\cb3 \ \cb1 can you remember their faces how they\cb3 \ \cb1 move [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 do you know why you love that person can you remember the things they did to earn\cb3 \ \cb1 your love\cb3 \ \cb1 how do you feel or how did you feel when they were around you what does your love\cb3 \ \cb1 feel like to spend a few moments exploring this\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] imagine there in front of you now and\cb3 \ \cb1 mentally repeat after me if I have harmed you in any way either knowingly\cb3 \ \cb1 or unknowingly through my own confusions\cb3 \ \cb1 I ask your forgiveness if there is a\cb3 \ \cb1 situation you are not yet ready to forgive me for I will be patient you\cb3 \ \cb1 have harmed me too perhaps knowingly or unknowingly through your own confusions\cb3 \ \cb1 but I forgive you and if there is a situation I am not yet\cb3 \ \cb1 ready to forgive you for please be patient\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] may you feel loving-kindness may you be\cb3 \ \cb1 filled with loving-kindness [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 may you be held in loving-kindness may\cb3 \ \cb1 you be happy and peaceful may you\cb3 \ \cb1 appreciate the gift of just being alive\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] now please try to hold on to that love\cb3 \ \cb1 and think of someone you neither like nor dislike it could be your mailman a\cb3 \ \cb1 co-worker or simply you see someone every day but have never spoken to\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 can you remember their faces how they\cb3 \ \cb1 move what they sound like if you've spoken to them now your love might be\cb3 \ \cb1 weakening a little at the moment try to hold on to that love you felt for the other person as you picture this new one\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] what if you knew that this person has\cb3 \ \cb1 children they love very much children they'd be willing to suffer for would\cb3 \ \cb1 that change your feelings about them\cb3 \ \cb1 consider that they may have pain and suffering but they might also want\cb3 \ \cb1 happiness for themselves and those they love might that warm you toward them a\cb3 \ \cb1 little imagine that they could be kind\cb3 \ \cb1 to you if you gave them a chance does the thought of loving them with the same\cb3 \ \cb1 intensity still seem strange can you imagine the possibility of it could you\cb3 \ \cb1 fake it a little could you try to feel the love you felt for the other person\cb3 \ \cb1 and keep this new person's face in mind just try to explore this thought over\cb3 \ \cb1 the next few moments [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 mentally repeat after me may you feel loving-kindness may you be filled with\cb3 \ \cb1 loving-kindness may be held in\cb3 \ \cb1 loving-kindness may you be happy and\cb3 \ \cb1 peaceful may you appreciate the gift of\cb3 \ \cb1 just being alive whatever living beings\cb3 \ \cb1 there may be may they all have happy minds may I not deceive another nor\cb3 \ \cb1 despise anyone anywhere even when angry or upset\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] may I not wish ill upon another just as\cb3 \ \cb1 the mother would protect her only child with her life even so mayor cultivate a\cb3 \ \cb1 boundless love towards all beings may I\cb3 \ \cb1 radiate boundless love towards the entire world unhindered without ill-will\cb3 \ \cb1 without enmity I'd like you to go back\cb3 \ \cb1 now and remember the person you love so much picture their faces and imagine that\cb3 \ \cb1 they're with you remember what it feels\cb3 \ \cb1 like when they're present and rest in that thought for the next few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and now the hard part bring to mind\cb3 \ \cb1 someone you dislike it doesn't matter\cb3 \ \cb1 why you dislike or hate them but could even be someone you've never met\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps some public figure whose blood makes you boil for some other reason if\cb3 \ \cb1 there's no such person in your life think of someone you've recently had a\cb3 \ \cb1 spat with and are still upset with I'm\cb3 \ \cb1 going to assume you've brought up someone you dislike let your emotions\cb3 \ \cb1 come but don't try to justify them simply let the experience of dislike\cb3 \ \cb1 come as your heart beat faster is a\cb3 \ \cb1 dialogue now coming into your header along the lines of I should have said this or I should have done that focus on\cb3 \ \cb1 your breathing but don't let the feelings go [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you I want you to imagine what this person\cb3 \ \cb1 you dislike might look like as a child long before they created whatever drama\cb3 \ \cb1 it is that upsets you so much try to\cb3 \ \cb1 create some emotional distance and imagine how they might act as a child\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps when they were three or four\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] visualize a small of them with a higher pitched voice and a face without\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever expression that annoys you so much\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] could you see yourself hating this imaginary child if this child were hurt\cb3 \ \cb1 or upset could you see yourself wanting to pick them up\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps hugging them to give them some comfort if you saw this child alone and\cb3 \ \cb1 scared could you see yourself walking away [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 what could you see yourself putting aside your own feelings to comfort someone in the midst of their own pain\cb3 \ \cb1 and suffering [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now imagine this person as they are now if you saw them alone and scared\cb3 \ \cb1 far away from wherever it is you have to interact with them if you saw them\cb3 \ \cb1 vulnerable suffering and in pain and know that this is that same child you\cb3 \ \cb1 would have comforted could you still dislike or hate them with the same\cb3 \ \cb1 intensity or could you see yourself softening a little\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if you could see this person holding a little child tenderly perhaps comforting\cb3 \ \cb1 that child could you see yourself softening a little more\cb3 \ \cb1 could you be a little less angry or upset with such a person if you could\cb3 \ \cb1 talk to the child this person was what would you say\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] mentally repeat after me if I have\cb3 \ \cb1 harmed you in any way either knowingly or unknowingly through my own confusions\cb3 \ \cb1 I ask your forgiveness if there is a\cb3 \ \cb1 situation you are not yet ready to forgive me for I will be patient you\cb3 \ \cb1 have harmed me too perhaps knowingly or unknowingly through your own confusions\cb3 \ \cb1 but I forgive you\cb3 \ \cb1 and if there is a situation I am not yet ready to forgive you for please be\cb3 \ \cb1 patient

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this deep relaxation sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation the following meditation is designed to help you relax deeply and\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep well it's called the 61 points of yoga nidra Yoga Nidra means yoga sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 and is an effective way of helping even the most die-hard insomniac get their 40\cb3 \ \cb1 winks for the night Yoga Nidra will take you into that intermediate state between\cb3 \ \cb1 waking and sleep so you could also perform it while sitting upright on your\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation mat or chair today's meditation however is designed for those\cb3 \ \cb1 of you who want to nod off so it's best done lying on your back not your side or\cb3 \ \cb1 on your stomach as doing so can affect your breathing so keep your spine\cb3 \ \cb1 straight and make sure that your head faces straight up not turn to one side\cb3 \ \cb1 lay your arms at a comfortable distance away from your body with your palms facing up and just spread your legs\cb3 \ \cb1 enough apart so they don't touch each other both your arms and legs should be\cb3 \ \cb1 kept straight not bent or elevated now\cb3 \ \cb1 closing your lips and relax your jaw so there's a gap between your teeth and\cb3 \ \cb1 gently rest the tip of your tongue against the back of your upper teeth and you can close your eyes go ahead and\cb3 \ \cb1 figured as much as you need in order to get comfortable so in a few more moments\cb3 \ \cb1 I'm going to ask you to synchronize your breathing to what I say\cb3 \ \cb1 the idea of this is to begin to slow down your breathing so inhale for two\cb3 \ \cb1 seconds exhale inhale again exhale and\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale again exile\cb3 \ \cb1 and now just extending that breath a little bit more now inhale for three seconds exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale so for this meditation or say a number\cb3 \ \cb1 followed by a body part for instance it'll be one right index\cb3 \ \cb1 finger now when you hear that number I want you to inhale and when you hear the\cb3 \ \cb1 body part I want you to focus on that body part\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you exhale I want you to pin your focus on that body part by thinking only\cb3 \ \cb1 of that body part and no other and when you hear the next number followed by the\cb3 \ \cb1 next body part inhale shift your focus to that new area then exhale as you pin\cb3 \ \cb1 your focus to that new spot\cb3 \ \cb1 so let's begin by lengthening your breath to a slow count of three so\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale 1 2 3 exhale 1 2 3\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale 1 2 3 exhale 1 2 3\cb3 \ \cb1

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello and welcome to this guided\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation on letting go and sleep my\cb3 \ \cb1 name is Jason Stevenson and I will be\cb3 \ \cb1 taking you through a relaxation before\cb3 \ \cb1 hopefully you'll be having an immensely\cb3 \ \cb1 satisfying sleep today my aim is to\cb3 \ \cb1 assist you in completely letting go and\cb3 \ \cb1 surrendering before sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 before we begin set your personal space\cb3 \ \cb1 up for this wine down to a good night's\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep put away all distracting items and\cb3 \ \cb1 power down all your devices apart from\cb3 \ \cb1 the one on which you are playing this\cb3 \ \cb1 recording you may wish to take a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 to jot down any pending tasks which can\cb3 \ \cb1 wait until tomorrow it's vital to\cb3 \ \cb1 incorporate rest into your busy schedule\cb3 \ \cb1 and with a good night's sleep you\cb3 \ \cb1 recharge your batteries and rejuvenate\cb3 \ \cb1 your spirit for a great day ahead so\cb3 \ \cb1 without further adieu lie back into a\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable position allowing your body\cb3 \ \cb1 to adjust your mattress\cb3 \ \cb1 feel your spine settling back and\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxing\cb3 \ \cb1 rest your head back against a pillow if\cb3 \ \cb1 that is your preference and just savor\cb3 \ \cb1 the relief of simply lying back after an\cb3 \ \cb1 active day\cb3 \ \cb1 if you haven't already done so let your\cb3 \ \cb1 eyes close naturally just allow the\cb3 \ \cb1 eyelids to gently come together no need\cb3 \ \cb1 to squeeze them shut and forget for the\cb3 \ \cb1 moment about trying to sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 just inhale deeply thinking to yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in\cb3 \ \cb1 hold your breath a little and then\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe out being conscious of your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath\cb3 \ \cb1 as our breathing comes under control so\cb3 \ \cb1 too does our mind it's not about trying\cb3 \ \cb1 too hard to control your breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 instead it's letting it occur naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 and just being aware of it\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next breath in focus on the\cb3 \ \cb1 center of your forward\cb3 \ \cb1 hold your breath permitting it to gently\cb3 \ \cb1 soothe your forehead like a bomb\cb3 \ \cb1 and relax let go\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next breath in feel your eyelids\cb3 \ \cb1 become soft and relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you exhale notice how your\cb3 \ \cb1 eyelids get heavier and heavier as they\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next breath in breathing in and\cb3 \ \cb1 feel cool energy to your cheeks and hold\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 exhaling feel your cheeks lower\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortably like they just drop deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 and deeper relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next breath in focusing on your\cb3 \ \cb1 jaw muscles\cb3 \ \cb1 feel your teeth come apart and your\cb3 \ \cb1 lower jaw drop slightly\cb3 \ \cb1 if the tip of your tongue is stuck to\cb3 \ \cb1 the roof of your mouth let it fall and\cb3 \ \cb1 relax\cb3 \ \cb1 next bring your attention to your neck\cb3 \ \cb1 muscles\cb3 \ \cb1 and on your breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 energy of that breath to need away at\cb3 \ \cb1 your neck taking the strain away\cb3 \ \cb1 senior Nick further\cb3 \ \cb1 on your next breath in bringing a dose\cb3 \ \cb1 of relief to your back\cb3 \ \cb1 the energy run along your spine\cb3 \ \cb1 unwinding all the knots in your upper\cb3 \ \cb1 and lower back\cb3 \ \cb1 and on your next breath out allow any\cb3 \ \cb1 tension or aches to be carried away with\cb3 \ \cb1 this strand of exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 feel your body relaxing deeper and\cb3 \ \cb1 deeper now\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in again and bring your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention to\cb3 \ \cb1 chest pulling apart all the knots that\cb3 \ \cb1 wind your chest up tired\cb3 \ \cb1 and breathe out and savor this\cb3 \ \cb1 liberating relief of deep and satisfying\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing in again and this time feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 your shoulders let go they drop a little\cb3 \ \cb1 and the muscles in your arms your biceps\cb3 \ \cb1 and triceps and into the forearms feel\cb3 \ \cb1 any stress in this area melt away\cb3 \ \cb1 right down to the tips of your fingers\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing in again and sending the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath right down to your abdomen and\cb3 \ \cb1 feel it expand\cb3 \ \cb1 and contract as you breathe out\cb3 \ \cb1 just letting it sink back in naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 and sending you into a deeper state of\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 introduce some of that relaxing energy\cb3 \ \cb1 to your legs as you take the next breath\cb3 \ \cb1 in\cb3 \ \cb1 upon breathing out let any remaining\cb3 \ \cb1 pressure escape through the tips of your\cb3 \ \cb1 toes and your outward breath\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 through the breath you bring balance to\cb3 \ \cb1 your system with each conscious breath\cb3 \ \cb1 you become more and more aware of the\cb3 \ \cb1 present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 very moment you simply are you are\cb3 \ \cb1 perfect you are whole just take a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 now to observe the natural flow of your\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 notice how with each breath in your\cb3 \ \cb1 chest\cb3 \ \cb1 izes and with each breath out it falls\cb3 \ \cb1 up and down\cb3 \ \cb1 just like the steadily swinging pendulum\cb3 \ \cb1 of life\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 bring your attention to this precise\cb3 \ \cb1 moment\cb3 \ \cb1 to struggle or to force yourself to do\cb3 \ \cb1 this by simply coming back to your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath you will return to the moment and\cb3 \ \cb1 become aware of it just breathe in and\cb3 \ \cb1 then breathe out\cb3 \ \cb1 from the start of a new day right up to\cb3 \ \cb1 the end we are exposed to thousands of\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts don't try to fight your\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts simply observe them witness\cb3 \ \cb1 them and then coming back to your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly let those thoughts go\cb3 \ \cb1 remember breathe in and breathe out\cb3 \ \cb1 you may find yourself thinking about a\cb3 \ \cb1 particular event or events that have\cb3 \ \cb1 passed\cb3 \ \cb1 slowing down the thought process\cb3 \ \cb1 drift among those memories witness them\cb3 \ \cb1 from above and recognize them\cb3 \ \cb1 tell yourself I'm thinking about this\cb3 \ \cb1 event I acknowledge it\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you breathe out move along with\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath detaching yourself a little\cb3 \ \cb1 more from that particular thought\cb3 \ \cb1 we must understand that we cannot change\cb3 \ \cb1 the past that we can learn something\cb3 \ \cb1 from it\cb3 \ \cb1 upon a lesson you might have learned\cb3 \ \cb1 from that event or those events\cb3 \ \cb1 again to not strain yourself to think of\cb3 \ \cb1 the lesson simply breathe in and breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 out again\cb3 \ \cb1 and if something comes to mind take it\cb3 \ \cb1 with you if not remain with the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and you can always return for further\cb3 \ \cb1 reflection at another time\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you breathe out let the past flow\cb3 \ \cb1 through your system and out to become\cb3 \ \cb1 one with the universe\cb3 \ \cb1 sometimes we are overpowered by a sense\cb3 \ \cb1 of anger or grief and that in turn holds\cb3 \ \cb1 us back if this is the case view now if\cb3 \ \cb1 any of these thoughts arise just breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 in\cb3 \ \cb1 focusing on that breathing breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 afresh energy and on your breath out\cb3 \ \cb1 becoming fully aware of your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 in this state of relaxation your mind is\cb3 \ \cb1 operating at a slower more passive\cb3 \ \cb1 frequency\cb3 \ \cb1 you are hence able to observe these\cb3 \ \cb1 feelings of anger or grief without\cb3 \ \cb1 letting it affect you\cb3 \ \cb1 a moment now to reflect upon this did\cb3 \ \cb1 not try too hard to determine the source\cb3 \ \cb1 of it simply acknowledge its presence\cb3 \ \cb1 and then return to the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 there are opportunities to become angry\cb3 \ \cb1 and upset every now and again however\cb3 \ \cb1 it's important to remember that we have\cb3 \ \cb1 a choice of whether or not to feed these\cb3 \ \cb1 emotions and by merely coming back to\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath you can bring yourself back\cb3 \ \cb1 into alignment you can choose not to let\cb3 \ \cb1 these things bother you they are not\cb3 \ \cb1 worth your precious time\cb3 \ \cb1 if you have any anger or resentment as\cb3 \ \cb1 you inhale and exhale let them go\cb3 \ \cb1 reminding yourself that is not worth\cb3 \ \cb1 giving into you want more you are strong\cb3 \ \cb1 our belief systems can sometimes place\cb3 \ \cb1 restrictions on us\cb3 \ \cb1 however we can all make the choice to\cb3 \ \cb1 follow what we truly believe in\cb3 \ \cb1 make yourself aware of this choice\cb3 \ \cb1 through the bread\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale bring into your system that\cb3 \ \cb1 things that are most important to you\cb3 \ \cb1 bring to mind what you most value in\cb3 \ \cb1 your life\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you breathe out let go of those\cb3 \ \cb1 feelings that do not resonate with you\cb3 \ \cb1 and that hold you back from being the\cb3 \ \cb1 best version of your truest self but\cb3 \ \cb1 those beliefs go knowing they do not\cb3 \ \cb1 serve the true you in any way\cb3 \ \cb1 it may not be our beliefs but a\cb3 \ \cb1 troubling thought may linger after hours\cb3 \ \cb1 of the event\cb3 \ \cb1 in this census like a game of tennis\cb3 \ \cb1 there are times when you may lose a\cb3 \ \cb1 point but there are other times where\cb3 \ \cb1 you'll gain one the only thing to\cb3 \ \cb1 remember is to keep playing and to keep\cb3 \ \cb1 playing it's simply a matter of\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing therefore just breathe in\cb3 \ \cb1 and breathe out again\cb3 \ \cb1 there is no saying what the future holds\cb3 \ \cb1 for us to dwell on the uncertainty only\cb3 \ \cb1 brings more stress more anxiety\cb3 \ \cb1 through gratitude and appreciation of\cb3 \ \cb1 all the gifts life has offered you today\cb3 \ \cb1 be certain that tomorrow will be better\cb3 \ \cb1 reassert this on your next breath bring\cb3 \ \cb1 in all the wonders of your present life\cb3 \ \cb1 everything that you are grateful for\cb3 \ \cb1 only think of one or two things and they\cb3 \ \cb1 can be as simple as having a roof over\cb3 \ \cb1 your head or having your next meal\cb3 \ \cb1 all this breath just for a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe out release all\cb3 \ \cb1 expectations of tomorrow let go of all\cb3 \ \cb1 control\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender and that weight of expectation\cb3 \ \cb1 will be automatically lifted\cb3 \ \cb1 here and now you are wholly present\cb3 \ \cb1 neither your past your future your\cb3 \ \cb1 troubles nor your beliefs can take this\cb3 \ \cb1 moment away from you\cb3 \ \cb1 this is the gift known as the present\cb3 \ \cb1 one that comes for all of us to embrace\cb3 \ \cb1 stay here for a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 in and out\cb3 \ \cb1 existing completely in this present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of everything that is beyond your\cb3 \ \cb1 control\cb3 \ \cb1 you've done your part to the best of\cb3 \ \cb1 your abilities the rest now will be\cb3 \ \cb1 taken care of\cb3 \ \cb1 trust in life now\cb3 \ \cb1 you deserve the best and with the\cb3 \ \cb1 following affirmations you may surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 completely you can mentally repeat these\cb3 \ \cb1 to yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 I accept all the gifts that the universe\cb3 \ \cb1 has to offer me\cb3 \ \cb1 I am grateful for\cb3 \ \cb1 mirakl I find around every corner\cb3 \ \cb1 I appreciate my life by living it to the\cb3 \ \cb1 fullest\cb3 \ \cb1 I love the way I am and believe in my\cb3 \ \cb1 abilities\cb3 \ \cb1 I am totally free\cb3 \ \cb1 I choose to do things that make me happy\cb3 \ \cb1 I fully deserve to be happy\cb3 \ \cb1 I am loved and loved fully\cb3 \ \cb1 I am the best version of my truest self\cb3 \ \cb1 I am fully present in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 I welcome wealth and abundance into my\cb3 \ \cb1 life\cb3 \ \cb1 I now surrender that which is beyond my\cb3 \ \cb1 control\cb3 \ \cb1 to the universe\cb3 \ \cb1 this is your final passageway to a rich\cb3 \ \cb1 and abundant sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 you've come a long way in accepting your\cb3 \ \cb1 present and letting go of that which has\cb3 \ \cb1 held you back\cb3 \ \cb1 you've worked hard and the sleep that\cb3 \ \cb1 beckons is fully deserved\cb3 \ \cb1 hold more miracles and blessings than\cb3 \ \cb1 what yesterday did expect the unexpected\cb3 \ \cb1 and surrender any pre-existing notions\cb3 \ \cb1 about the future just let them go\cb3 \ \cb1 focus now entirely on the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and let it carry you on to your slumber\cb3 \ \cb1 follow your own natural rhythm breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 in and out\cb3 \ \cb1 and in your mind's eye visualize a trap\cb3 \ \cb1 door that opens up\cb3 \ \cb1 ten steps covered in thick crimson\cb3 \ \cb1 carpet that easily muffles your\cb3 \ \cb1 footsteps leads downwards to a\cb3 \ \cb1 pleasantly lit place of peace\cb3 \ \cb1 I will count you down from ten guiding\cb3 \ \cb1 each step that you take\cb3 \ \cb1 10 take the first step\cb3 \ \cb1 holding onto the golden rail\cb3 \ \cb1 you are reminded of the soothing balm of\cb3 \ \cb1 your breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 9\cb3 \ \cb1 letting go surrendering\cb3 \ \cb1 eight\cb3 \

body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] take another long slow deep breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 pausing again and then exhale empty your\cb3 \ \cb1 lungs completely with your out-breath [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and again take a deep breath in to signal to your body and mind that it is\cb3 \ \cb1 your time to fully relax take your time hold for a moment and then let it go\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps you can already feel yourself

ID\cb3 \ \cb1 give yourself permission to be here right now doing just this\cb3 \ \cb1 sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission in order\cb3 \ \cb1 to let go of the past\cb3 \ \cb1 give yourself some space space for\cb3 \ \cb1 something new space to grow into\cb3 \ \cb1 what do you want to let go of right now\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] what has become too heavy a weight to\cb3 \ \cb1 bear on your journey\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 like the falling leaves it's time to clear out and free yourself of things\cb3 \ \cb1 you may have been afraid to let go of in the past

are\cb3 \ \cb1 able to stop resisting your experience at any given moment\cb3 \ \cb1 when we want things to be different than they are that is when we develop\cb3 \ \cb1 resistance or tension today practice\cb3 \ \cb1 letting go of resistance be here now\cb3 \ \cb1 just as you are and you can get into the\cb3 \ \cb1 flow\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you notice your body sensations accept them just as they are\cb3 \ \cb1 whether you may typically label these sensations as positive or negative\cb3 \ \cb1 settle into your body except being in\cb3 \ \cb1 your body right now just as you are\cb3 \ \cb1 be with the sensations you experience\cb3 \ \cb1 accepting all that you are there is no\cb3 \ \cb1 need to make a change during meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 be just as you are\cb3 \ \cb1 accepting allows you to fully experience what is happening in the present to\cb3 \ \cb1 fully engage in life\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 listen to what your soul is sharing with you right now\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to be receptive to these sensations for a few moments longer with\cb3 \ \cb1 love and kindness for yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 feel the lightness that has washed over you as you have shed the weight that you\cb3 \ \cb1 have been carrying around for far too long\cb3 \ \cb1 we can learn from our faults and grow from our experiences if we allow them\cb3 \ \cb1 know that without experiencing suffering we also cannot experience joy without\cb3 \ \cb1 darkness we cannot know light allowing\cb3 \ \cb1 life just as it is can lessen any struggle and perhaps any additional and\cb3 \ \cb1 unnecessary suffering\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to soften soften from the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface all the way to deep within you\cb3 \ \cb1 release any guarding you may be holding on to\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender to anything you were holding on to for fear of losing let go of what\cb3 \ \cb1 could have been\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of worry of the possibility of a new way\cb3 \ \cb1 let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 let the sensations dissolve from your muscles\cb3 \ \cb1 every day we get a new chance to be in this moment it is okay simply breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 and notice\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender to the ability of your body to heal itself surrender to the love within\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 know your ability to give and to receive love\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender let go and be held by pure love trust\cb3 \ \cb1 you are loved in darkness and in light\cb3 \ \cb1 all of you is loved simply trust\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice once more how you feel and allow\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to feel just as you are for an\cb3 \ \cb1 even deeper connection with yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender to your breath feel your body being breathed being moved by your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath trust\cb3 \ \cb1 it's okay simply breathe and notice\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the sounds in your environment just as they are\cb3 \ \cb1 here are the sounds as they come to you without searching them out\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the subtle noises to drift into your awareness with simple curiosity\cb3 \ \cb1 take interest in the sounds just as they are simply allow the sounds to be rather\cb3 \ \cb1 than seeing them as a distraction or an obstacle\cb3 \ \cb1 if you can practice accepting the sounds just as they are without the desire to\cb3 \ \cb1 change you can also begin to practice\cb3 \ \cb1 acceptance and surrender in other areas\cb3 \ \cb1 of your life\cb3 \ \cb1 frequently the word surrender has a negative energy to it you may think of\cb3 \ \cb1 having to give up something that is important to you or lose control over a\cb3 \ \cb1 situation\cb3 \ \cb1 Surrender does not mean giving up when\cb3 \ \cb1 the word surrender is used as a mindfulness practice it can also be the\cb3 \ \cb1 opportunity to give up anything that is no longer serving you or anything that\cb3 \ \cb1 is keeping you stuck [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 consider this beautiful quote by Debbie Ford surrender is a gift that you can\cb3 \ \cb1 give yourself it's an act of faith it's\cb3 \ \cb1 saying that even though I can't see where the river is flowing I trust it\cb3 \ \cb1 will take me in the right direction\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 any obstacle or challenge in your life might actually be taking you in the\cb3 \ \cb1 right direction allow the flow of the\cb3 \ \cb1 energy of life\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 when you feel life brings you challenges you can't accept you have the\cb3 \ \cb1 opportunity to be transformed by acceptance you may add suffering when\cb3 \ \cb1 you resist the way things are because they aren't the way you expect or want\cb3 \ \cb1 them to be [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the\cb3 \ \cb1 way things are naturally there is a\cb3 \ \cb1 possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted\cb3 \ \cb1 and believed to be true peace is\cb3 \ \cb1 available when you stop resisting any given moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] although you don't have control of what\cb3 \ \cb1 goes on beyond yourself you do have a choice as to how you respond to your\cb3 \ \cb1 experience and this choice gives you the\cb3 \ \cb1 opportunity to experience in our peace\cb3 \ \cb1 you can decide your attitude in any given circumstance\cb3 \ \cb1 noticing the sensations in your body with a relaxed awareness once more\cb3 \ \cb1 since that you now feel as if the weight of tension has been lifted and released\cb3 \ \cb1 from your body\cb3 \ \cb1 you sense that you are feeling lighter now almost as if you are floating and\cb3 \ \cb1 gravity has let go of its effects on you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 this lightness comes from letting go of\cb3 \ \cb1 anything and everything weighing on you\cb3 \ \cb1 both physically and emotionally\cb3 \ \cb1 it has been lifted completely out of your body [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 this release allows you to feel lighter physically and you drift into a more\cb3 \ \cb1 productive sleep to prepare you for the day ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] let go of tension\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] let go of pain\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of negativity and make room for\cb3 \ \cb1 the rejuvenation of a deep night's sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 let this come to you easily and effortlessly\cb3 \ \cb1 in your mind here these positive affirmations as your own beliefs hear\cb3 \ \cb1 them as truth in this present moment let\cb3 \ \cb1 these statements move you towards a spiritual surrender allow these ideas to\cb3 \ \cb1 help you drift into a deep healing state\cb3 \ \cb1 you don't have to do anything simply listen and allow sleep to come easily to\cb3 \ \cb1 you eventually my voice will fade away\cb3 \ \cb1 and you will drift off into a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 healing state of sleep for many hours I\cb3 \ \cb1 am ready to release the past and move forward now\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I am ready to surrender and move forward\cb3 \ \cb1 now [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I surrender I allow I accept\cb3 \ \cb1 I surrender by giving up attachments to results\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] I am freely allowing and enjoying this\cb3 \ \cb1 moment I surrender all struggle\cb3 \ \cb1 I forgive myself\cb3 \ \cb1 I release all attachments coming from me\cb3 \ \cb1 I let go of expectations\cb3 \ \cb1 I create space for new beginnings I am\cb3 \ \cb1 supported loved and cared for\cb3 \ \cb1 things always work out for me when I relax and

habits and choose new\cb3 \ \cb1 positive ones\cb3 \ \cb1 I choose the responses to my experiences\cb3 \ \cb1 I allow the lessons I'm learning\cb3 \ \cb1 I am filled with positive actions [Music]\cb3

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello and welcome to this short\cb3 \ \cb1 guided meditation to help you start your\cb3 \ \cb1 day on the right note\cb3 \ \cb1 by setting an intention and visualizing\cb3 \ \cb1 how you would like your day to unfold\cb3 \ \cb1 to begin this practice take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 find a comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 seated position\cb3 \ \cb1 and however you find yourself seated\cb3 \ \cb1 elongate your spine as if your crown of\cb3 \ \cb1 the head is touching up towards the\cb3 \ \cb1 morning sun\cb3 \ \cb1 and allowing your shoulders to drop and\cb3 \ \cb1 your chest\cb3 \ \cb1 to open gently\cb3 \ \cb1 closing your eyes if you haven't already\cb3 \ \cb1 done so and then take a few moments to\cb3 \ \cb1 check in with your natural ebb and\cb3 \ \cb1 flow of your breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 and just notice if there's any\cb3 \ \cb1 restrictions or\cb3 \ \cb1 contraction that is inhibiting your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath from flowing\cb3 \ \cb1 into the fullness of your lungs\cb3 \ \cb1 and where it is possible for you to\cb3 \ \cb1 consciously shift this\cb3 \ \cb1 see where you might invite increased\cb3 \ \cb1 softness or\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender into your physical body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you might relax the belly\cb3 \ \cb1 the jaw or your shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 to facilitate the flow of this life\cb3 \ \cb1 force\cb3 \ \cb1 and now before we begin our intention\cb3 \ \cb1 setting and\cb3 \ \cb1 visualization practice let's just take\cb3 \ \cb1 three\cb3 \ \cb1 long deep breaths together\cb3 \ \cb1 and begin by emptying your lungs all of\cb3 \ \cb1 it\cb3 \ \cb1 and take a full deep breath into the\cb3 \ \cb1 belly for a count of\cb3 \ \cb1 four\cb3 \ \cb1 pause for a second at the top and then\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly let it go for a count of four\cb3 \ \cb1 another slow deep breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 brief pause at the top and then\cb3 \ \cb1 completely\cb3 \ \cb1 release as you breathe out\cb3 \ \cb1 one more full deep nourishing breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 and brief pause and then release with a\cb3 \ \cb1 soft\cb3 \ \cb1 sigh as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 and just let the breath continue to flow\cb3 \ \cb1 naturally as it awakens you\cb3 \ \cb1 to this day ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 now i invite you to take a silent moment\cb3 \ \cb1 to tune in with your heart as you\cb3 \ \cb1 reflect upon\cb3 \ \cb1 what intention you would like to set\cb3 \ \cb1 for your day\cb3 \ \cb1 it might be to move forward with courage\cb3 \ \cb1 and confidence\cb3 \ \cb1 to be loving and compassionate with\cb3 \ \cb1 those you interact with\cb3 \ \cb1 maybe to feel grounded and centered in\cb3 \ \cb1 your being\cb3 \ \cb1 or anything else that feels true to your\cb3 \ \cb1 most authentic\cb3 \ \cb1 self this morning\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and whatever it is take a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 to silently formulate that intention\cb3 \ \cb1 into a single sentence\cb3 \ \cb1 and then silently repeat it to yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 with heartfulness and commitment\cb3 \ \cb1 and know that there is no right or wrong\cb3 \ \cb1 intention to set\cb3 \ \cb1 so you don't have to overthink it just\cb3 \ \cb1 let whatever arises from within your\cb3 \ \cb1 heart\cb3 \ \cb1 and be led by that\cb3 \ \cb1 now with this intention in mind\cb3 \ \cb1 and with your commitment to embody it in\cb3 \ \cb1 each minute\cb3 \ \cb1 an hour that unfolds i invite you to\cb3 \ \cb1 visualize your next\cb3 \ \cb1 few steps upon finishing this meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 where will you go next and what energy\cb3 \ \cb1 will you travel with there\cb3 \ \cb1 how will your body and mind feel as you\cb3 \ \cb1 move through the morning\cb3 \ \cb1 with your intention radiating out from\cb3 \ \cb1 within you\cb3 \ \cb1 picture how you will stand how you will\cb3 \ \cb1 walk\cb3 \ \cb1 what you will wear and which\cb3 \ \cb1 qualities you will carry with you\cb3 \ \cb1 and then follow your steps even further\cb3 \ \cb1 into the future\cb3 \ \cb1 what will your late morning look like\cb3 \ \cb1 your lunch hour or your early afternoon\cb3 \ \cb1 consider any interactions you will have\cb3 \ \cb1 the effortless moments the potential\cb3 \ \cb1 challenges\cb3 \ \cb1 and the simple moments in between\cb3 \ \cb1 picture yourself navigate all of these\cb3 \ \cb1 moments with grace\cb3 \ \cb1 ease and authenticity\cb3 \ \cb1 as you visualize yourself moving through\cb3 \ \cb1 the day\cb3 \ \cb1 notice how it feels to be you\cb3 \ \cb1 to be the you who lives in alignment\cb3 \ \cb1 with your highest intent\cb3 \ \cb1 let this energy embed itself in each\cb3 \ \cb1 cell of your being\cb3 \ \cb1 as you watch yourself effortlessly\cb3 \ \cb1 moving forward\cb3 \ \cb1 through the day\cb3 \ \cb1 consider next how you will transition\cb3 \ \cb1 into late\cb3 \ \cb1 afternoon and evening what interactions\cb3 \ \cb1 do you expect to have\cb3 \ \cb1 if there are any obstacles you imagine\cb3 \ \cb1 might cross your path\cb3 \ \cb1 know that you have within you what it\cb3 \ \cb1 takes to navigate these\cb3 \ \cb1 as best as can be done let your\cb3 \ \cb1 intention and the vision of your higher\cb3 \ \cb1 self\cb3 \ \cb1 guide your steps forward\cb3 \ \cb1 spend just a few final moments\cb3 \ \cb1 visualizing\cb3 \ \cb1 any important details about the day\cb3 \ \cb1 ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 and then empower these visions with\cb3 \ \cb1 trust faith\cb3 \ \cb1 and confidence in yourself and in your\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 intention\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you are ready slowly let the\cb3 \ \cb1 imagery dissolve as you come back to\cb3 \ \cb1 your breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 watch the breath as it flows through the\cb3 \ \cb1 heart space\cb3 \ \cb1 and from the heart i invite you to\cb3 \ \cb1 silently repeat\cb3 \ \cb1 the following words i move\cb3 \ \cb1 forward in alignment with my highest\cb3 \ \cb1 intent\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 i move forward in alignment with my\cb3 \ \cb1 highest\cb3 \ \cb1 intent\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 i move forward in alignment with my\cb3 \ \cb1 highest\cb3 \ \cb1 intent\cb3 \ \cb1 and now just take three long deep\cb3 \ \cb1 breaths to close this practice\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and after that last breath whenever you\cb3 \ \cb1 are ready\cb3 \ \cb1 you can slowly open your eyes to the day\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you move forward let your\cb3 \ \cb1 intention\cb3 \ \cb1 and your highest visions empower the\cb3 \ \cb1 hours to come\cb3 \ \cb1 thank you for your time\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \ \cb1 English (auto-generated)\cb3 \ \ \ \ }

\f0\fs22 \cf2 tonight I have a treat for your bedtime routine clear the clutter of your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 slow down the momentum of your day and sleep peacefully the practice of\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation is about returning your attention to the present moment with acceptance and kindness for what you\cb3 \ \cb1 find it is about coming back to the present when you find yourself going down the rabbit hole of worrying\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts the more you practice the more skilled you will become both in the\cb3 \ \cb1 practice as well as in everyday life meditation before bed is a wonderful way\cb3 \ \cb1 to quiet the raising thoughts and positively prepare for the day ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 today I will guide you to practice this skill to help lessen the level of stress\cb3 \ \cb1 and worry so that you can experience a tranquil deep sleep hello and welcome\cb3 \ \cb1 I'm Sarah Raymond from the mindful movement thank you for joining me today\cb3 \ \cb1 here we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive\cb3 \ \cb1 mind set and heal from the stress that's blocking your fulfillment now I invite\cb3 \ \cb1 you to make yourself comfortable take a moment and make sure your\cb3 \ \cb1 environment is all set for you to drift off into sleep it is important for you\cb3 \ \cb1 to have the sense of safety so you can fully relax make sure the room is dark\cb3 \ \cb1 all screens and electronics are off and you are as comfortable as you can be if\cb3 \ \cb1 you are listening to this on electronic device turn the screens light away from\cb3 \ \cb1 you create the most comfortable environment you can pause this recording\cb3 \ \cb1 if you need a little more time [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 we will start this meditation with your eyes open gently although your room is\cb3 \ \cb1 probably dark focus your gaze softly on one point a spot on the floor or the\cb3 \ \cb1 wall or perhaps just a sense of color in the darkness\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] narrow your focus to this one single\cb3 \ \cb1 point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away\cb3 \ \cb1 let your focus rest on this one point\cb3 \ \cb1 stay with this narrow focus for a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 then as if this one point could get even smaller begin to draw your focus in\cb3 \ \cb1 until your eyes gradually closed\cb3 \ \cb1 and you allow your attention to turn inward\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] invite your thoughts to do the same\cb3 \ \cb1 narrowing inward letting the momentum of\cb3 \ \cb1 the day gradually slow [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 be patient with this process of slowing down\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 when your eyes fully closed and your attention turns inward bring your\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness to your breath [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to count the length of your natural breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you breathe out encourage your exhale to be one count longer than your\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 allow each long exhale to carry away\cb3 \ \cb1 with it any physical and emotional\cb3 \ \cb1 stress or tension [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 by exhaling longer than you inhale your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath will slow and your body will calm\cb3 \ \cb1 down\cb3 \ \cb1 continue lengthening your exhale for a few breaths cycles\cb3 \ \cb1 letting go of the counting if you like and simply sense the full exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 know that your breath is an anchor or a reminder for you to come back to the\cb3 \ \cb1 present moment if you find your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 wandering or find you are distracted by\cb3 \ \cb1 sounds come back to your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath\cb3 \ \cb1 come any sooner than the present moment [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 in this gradual process of slowing down\cb3 \ \cb1 you may still have thoughts going through your mind simply notice them and\cb3 \ \cb1 let them move on as you come back to your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the\cb3 \ \cb1 intention to simplify and to slow down\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your body to soften and your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath to be calm\cb3 \ \cb1 if it feels right to you as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright\cb3 \ \cb1 white color to it and it is filling you\cb3 \ \cb1 up [Music] and as you breathe out this white light\cb3 \ \cb1 is taking with it any physical tension\cb3 \ \cb1 or feelings of worry [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] take a long slow deep breath in through\cb3 \ \cb1 your nose [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 move this breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light\cb3 \ \cb1 and making space then allow your body to\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender to the weight of gravity and relax as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] breathe out anything that no longer\cb3 \ \cb1 serves you on your journey to simplify\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 each full breath clears out the clutter\cb3 \ \cb1 and relaxes your body and mind even\cb3 \ \cb1 deeper inhale the bright white light\cb3 \ \cb1 exhale let go deeper and deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 allow my voice to be your guide into\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation you can drift off to sleep when your\cb3 \ \cb1 body is ready [Music] and your subconscious mind will continue\cb3 \ \cb1 listening and relaxing even further\cb3 \ \cb1 like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down\cb3 \ \cb1 in relationship to each breath\cb3 \ \cb1 as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and the similar space or pause between\cb3 \ \cb1 your thoughts [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen be in the gap\cb3 \ \cb1 no need to do anything simply be in this\cb3 \ \cb1 space [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 in a moment now I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting\cb3 \ \cb1 from the top of your head going all the\cb3 \ \cb1 way through your body to your feet as I\cb3 \ \cb1 say each part of your body see this part\cb3 \ \cb1 in your mind's eye [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and you can relax that body part completely [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] encourage the weight of your body to be\cb3 \ \cb1 completely supported by the surface below you so that there is no need to\cb3 \ \cb1 hold on you can simply let go into sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 now as we begin to scan the body bring\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention to the top of your head [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 intend to feel this area from the inside of your body as sensations only\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 without moving your eyes as you scan your body simply move your awareness to\cb3 \ \cb1 each part [Music] and as your awareness flows throughout\cb3 \ \cb1 your body you can relax each part completely\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let's begin this relaxation

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep well a guided meditation sleep talked down it's time to get comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 now this meditation is best done lying down and preferably in bed prior to\cb3 \ \cb1 wanting to go to sleep so begin by closing your eyes having your hands\cb3 \ \cb1 placed beside you and taking in three deep breaths breathing in through the\cb3 \ \cb1 nose and out through the mouth really\cb3 \ \cb1 take deep breaths here and letting go of all the tension of the day on the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 out and after you've done this bring\cb3 \ \cb1 your breathing back to its natural rhythm not trying to change your rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 just being aware of the breath coming in and going out\cb3 \ \cb1 with each breath in fill your body relax and loosen a little bit more and with\cb3 \ \cb1 each breath out feel the tension of the day melting away\cb3 \ \cb1 your body becomes supple and relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 deeply relaxed [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 whilst you are beginning to relax know that soon sleep will come you do not\cb3 \ \cb1 need to strive for it to obtain it you just need to listen to my voice as I\cb3 \ \cb1 guide you towards it naturally and without effort if any thoughts come into\cb3 \ \cb1 your mind during this meditation that's perfectly normal it's okay for this to happen we are\cb3 \ \cb1 thinking beings and so we think thousands of thoughts a day what I ask\cb3 \ \cb1 you to do is simply observe the thoughts without attaching to it and in their own\cb3 \ \cb1 time allow them to melt away whilst you focus back on my voice or to your\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing now make sure you are lying\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortably and if not change your position now even just slightly\cb3 \ \cb1 make sure that your body is evenly balanced your hands out to the side and\cb3 \ \cb1 mentally check right now for any tension throughout your body poor posture or\cb3 \ \cb1 day-to-day stresses can make you hold tension in various parts of your body it's time now to just let it all go\cb3 \ \cb1 focusing on your feet move them a little and tense them hold that tension and now\cb3 \ \cb1 let them go shake any tension free just allow them to fall naturally tighten up\cb3 \ \cb1 your ankles and calf muscles then your knees squeeze it all tightly hold and\cb3 \ \cb1 let the tension go really really relaxed this part of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 do the same now for your thighs hips and buttocks tighten then stretch out and\cb3 \ \cb1 release just let go as though this part of your body is just melting through to\cb3 \ \cb1 the floor [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now tighten your back and your stomach area tense hold and release all this\cb3 \ \cb1 tension let it go if you feel any\cb3 \ \cb1 tension here that seems to be deeply rooted you can repeat this again\cb3 \ \cb1 now move onto your arms tightening your arms shoulders and neck muscles hold and\cb3 \ \cb1 release let go\cb3 \ \cb1 make sure that your jaw is relaxed let your tongue rest against the roof of\cb3 \ \cb1 your mouth and your lips be open slightly we often carry tension across the scalp\cb3 \ \cb1 and forward to just breathe in and exhale and visualize the muscles\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxing at will and again breathing in\cb3 \ \cb1 and on the breath out see your facial muscles just relax\cb3 \ \cb1 systematically working your way through your body in this enables you to eradicate tension and allows our muscles\cb3 \ \cb1 to relax it enables you to embrace deep sleep as it happens without worrying\cb3 \ \cb1 about it it becomes a routine a positive behavior that leads naturally towards\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep you just have to let go of everyday problems and learn to empty\cb3 \ \cb1 your mind doing this form of meditation practice can help you to let go of\cb3 \ \cb1 everyday problems by focusing on other things and it helps release thoughts old\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts negative thoughts unwanted thoughts for the day when these thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 come up simply always keep coming back to my talking or your own breathing if\cb3 \ \cb1 you struggle to stop the bombardment of thoughts infiltrating your mind or find\cb3 \ \cb1 that you constantly try to solve problems the moment you lie down instead turn your attention to your breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale and count the breath in for four seconds hold the breath for four and\cb3 \ \cb1 then exhale for a count of four this can\cb3 \ \cb1 work wonders take a slow deep breath breathe in and\cb3 \ \cb1 feel the breath filling all the way up from the diaphragm and all the way up to\cb3 \ \cb1 the top of the lungs now exhale slowly and feel the diaphragm deflating and\cb3 \ \cb1 tension starting to dissipate now repeat\cb3 \ \cb1 this do this again and this time on the breath out visualizing tension and\cb3 \ \cb1 anxieties leaving your body every time you exhale find me one more time breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 in deep breath in and let it go\cb3 \ \cb1 now imagine yourself standing in a cavern at the top of some ancient steps\cb3 \ \cb1 the steps have been carved into the rock face many years before and although you\cb3 \ \cb1 were inside with the roof of the cavern being too high to reach you feel a cool\cb3 \ \cb1 soothing breeze coming up the steps it's\cb3 \ \cb1 a narrow set of steps but you are longing to know what is at the bottom as you are ready to settle down for the\cb3 \ \cb1 night know that you will be safe as you\cb3 \ \cb1 walk down them and it is a part of your journey towards deep and undisturbed\cb3 \ \cb1 slumber strategically placed torches\cb3 \ \cb1 with golden flickering flames light the way down the steps casting an orange\cb3 \ \cb1 glow this late hour [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you progress down the steps know that you will become more and more relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 trail your hands down the rocky walls as you progress downwards one step at a\cb3 \ \cb1 time slowly and steadily listen to the sound\cb3 \ \cb1 of my voice but allow the sensations of the moment to filter within visualize\cb3 \ \cb1 the texture of the rock beneath your fingertips feel the slightly warm but\cb3 \ \cb1 textured surface beneath your bare feet you feel a part of nature and a part of\cb3 \ \cb1 history of this place you feel timeless sensations now step down again you feel\cb3 \ \cb1 peaceful you are relaxed and you can let\cb3 \ \cb1 go of any anxieties you may be holding on to\cb3 \ \cb1 step down again

moving\cb3 \ \cb1 downwards you are so relaxed each step\cb3 \ \cb1 takes you nearer to this fluctuating colored light feel relaxed absorb the\cb3 \ \cb1 sense of peace in this place [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you make your way down to the bottom step and emerge from the cavern you\cb3 \ \cb1 realize that you are now outside at the bottom of a cliff but have emerged in\cb3 \ \cb1 the most beautiful and quiet secret place there is a small pathway ahead of\cb3 \ \cb1 you stepping stones that neatly interlock and guide you towards a\cb3 \ \cb1 platform surrounding by sparkling waters that glisten under the velvet night sky\cb3 \ \cb1 the sound of water trickling over tiny stones is soothing you pause to enjoy\cb3 \ \cb1 these sounds for a few moments [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you walk along the pathway your feet bear against the warmth of the stones\cb3 \ \cb1 heated by the earlier Sun you see that the platform is small and partially\cb3 \ \cb1 covered at the sides with a pliant willow frame adorned with honeysuckle and jasmine\cb3 \ \cb1 climbing up over filling the air with the subtlest of sense stretching across\cb3 \ \cb1 the platform but looking further out to see a hammock ideally placed for the\cb3 \ \cb1 most relaxing nighttime experience take\cb3 \ \cb1 a moment now to climb into the hammock it is easy there is no difficulty

beyond both lungs and belly to awaken each\cb3 \ \cb1 and every cell of your being let each and every inhalation breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 itself into your whole body\cb3 \ \cb1 with each of these full body breaths imagine that every in-breath brings vitality and\cb3 \ \cb1 aliveness to your cells and that each breath out frees you of\cb3 \ \cb1 stagnation or lethargy\cb3 \ \cb1 so feeling into the stillness yet radiant vitality\cb3 \ \cb1 of your body in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 and now before we move into a visualization to help us manifest our greatest aspirations for the physical\cb3 \ \cb1 body let's take some time now to hone our attention on specific energy centers within your\cb3 \ \cb1 body as we draw our attention through the body we will awaken the major energy points\cb3 \ \cb1 within it that help us to achieve this new physical reality so begin now by drawing your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention to the base of your spine to the root of your being\cb3 \ \cb1 with your awareness held here at the root chakra let each breath in fill this part of you\cb3 \ \cb1 with a renewed sense of connectedness to the physical world\cb3 \ \cb1 to the earth beneath you and to your very own body\cb3 \ \cb1 you are grounded connected and full of vitality\cb3 \ \cb1 now let your awareness shift slowly to the navel as you hold your attention on your core\cb3 \ \cb1 let each breath in create an expansion here filling you with confidence will power\cb3 \ \cb1 and determination to achieve your dreams\cb3 \ \cb1 you are strong resilient and empowered\cb3 \ \cb1 let your inward gaze now move away from the core as it lands in the heart space in the\cb3 \ \cb1 center of your chest\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you hold your attention here on the heart let each breath awaken your sense of\cb3 \ \cb1 self-love and unconditional worthiness\cb3 \ \cb1 you are loved worthy and wonderful\cb3 \ \cb1 and slowly now shift your awareness to your third eye to the center of your forehead and just\cb3 \ \cb1 slightly higher than your brow line\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you hold your awareness here let each inhalation awaken your capacity for\cb3 \ \cb1 inspired imagination as well as your ability to intuit\cb3 \ \cb1 what your body requires in any moment\cb3 \ \cb1 you see and believe in your highest potential you know what your body needs\cb3 \ \cb1 and now allow your attention to land on the crown of your head the top of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 let each inhalation rise to fill this part of your being\cb3 \ \cb1 and as it does allow it to fill you with a deep connection to the limitless energy of\cb3 \ \cb1 this world whatever you require to achieve the physical state you long for\cb3 \ \cb1 the universe can provide it\cb3 \ \cb1 you are connected supported and ready for transformation\cb3 \ \cb1 now let your focus open up as you come back to full awareness of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 now in your mind's eye i invite you to envision that you are standing on a warm and sandy beach\cb3 \ \cb1 gazing across azure blue waters\cb3 \ \cb1 and behind you staggering amber cliffs rise up towards the sky\cb3 \ \cb1 the contrast between the bright blue waters and this rich orange earth is\cb3 \ \cb1 mesmerizing you revel in the beauty and wonder of this space\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you turn back towards the sea you take a few moments to ground\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself into the place that you occupy\cb3 \ \cb1 through the soles of your feet you ground yourself into the soft sand and earth that supports you\cb3 \ \cb1 that provides you with vital earthly energy\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and through the crown of your head you\cb3 \ \cb1 connect with the limitless potential of the universe your mind is beginning to expand to let\cb3 \ \cb1 all possibilities filter into your awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the upward moving energy from the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 meets with the downward moving energy from the cosmos landing in the center of your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 and grounding you in love these energies meet in the heart to\cb3 \ \cb1 ensure that all actions you take are rooted in and reflective of self-care\cb3 \ \cb1 self-kindness and self-love\cb3 \ \cb1 so take a few long deep breaths as you harness the energy above\cb3 \ \cb1 below and all around you\cb3 \ \cb1 and after your last long exhale let the breath come back to its natural\cb3 \ \cb1 rhythm as you envision yourself moving down the coastline\cb3 \ \cb1 how you move down this beach is entirely up to you perhaps you walk with grace run with\cb3 \ \cb1 strength dance with full expression or move in some other way that your body\cb3 \ \cb1 feels called to move in\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever mode of movement helps you to feel strong and stable in your body\cb3 \ \cb1 envision yourself flowing effortlessly along the sandy beach before you you are\cb3 \ \cb1 deeply attuned to the needs and wishes of your body in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 note what it feels like to move in this way take this time to observe what feelings\cb3 \ \cb1 and sensations arise\cb3 \ \cb1 how does your body look as you move how does it feel to move with strength\cb3 \ \cb1 confidence and agility\cb3 \ \cb1 spend just a few more moments allowing yourself to move in a way that inspires you\cb3 \ \cb1 until soon the beach begins to narrow as it reaches its northernmost end\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] from where you stand at the tip of this beach\cb3 \ \cb1 you realize you have two options to go back to the place you started at\cb3 \ \cb1 or to venture onwards and up\cb3 \ \cb1 you choose the latter and so you decide to climb the rock face that leads\cb3 \ \cb1 gradually up towards the peak of these majestic cliffs\cb3 \ \cb1 you follow a small foot trail that takes you a few meters up from the beach\cb3 \ \cb1 and that is where the work begins step by step you make your way up the\cb3 \ \cb1 mountainous terrain with confidence and strength your body is fully engaged and your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 is radiant and alive\cb3 \ \cb1 with each step you take you shed any and all limiting beliefs that hold you back\cb3 \ \cb1 from achieving your fullest potential\cb3 \ \cb1 your body too sheds any excess weight that no longer serves you\cb3 \ \cb1 or it builds the muscle the natural strength that you have long been yearning to\cb3 \ \cb1 cultivate perhaps it does both\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel and empowered to achieve the perfect body for yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 you are beginning right here right now\cb3 \ \cb1 notice how it feels to exert yourself in this way to absorb the energy of the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 the sky and the sun and to propel yourself forward with vitality you are fully\cb3 \ \cb1 alive relish in what this feels like\cb3 \ \cb1 soon the incline decreases in intensity as you approach the highest plateau of\cb3 \ \cb1 the cliff face as your movements slow and require less of your energy\cb3 \ \cb1 you come back to the rhythm of your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing slowly and deeply you take your last few steps towards the highest\cb3 \ \cb1 lookout point of this mountainous terrain from where you stand you can see the\cb3 \ \cb1 shoreline extending for miles and miles and the sea drifting into the horizon\cb3 \ \cb1 the water azure blue by the shore slowly fades into a deep and mysterious\cb3 \ \cb1 darkness you are in awe with the beauty of this landscape\cb3 \ \cb1 as you gaze out across the ocean you realize that anything is possible\cb3 \ \cb1 you see this infinite world of possibility reflected in your own mind and spirit\cb3 \ \cb1 confident in your ability to achieve whatever it is you long for\cb3 \ \cb1 and with your feet grounded in the rich earth beneath you you stand tall and strong\cb3 \ \cb1 fully grounded in this body that carries you through life\cb3 \ \cb1 a deep sense of gratitude for your physical body moves through you\cb3 \ \cb1 and so you thank it for its wisdom support and resilience\cb3 \ \cb1 you take just a few more moments to gaze out across the vast sea below you\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you turn around to find a comfortable place to rest your body\cb3 \ \cb1 you were surprised to find a mirror has appeared from seemingly nowhere\cb3 \ \cb1 it stands on the pathway that leads down to the grassy valley below\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly you make your way towards the mirror mindful step by step\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you reach it your eyes widen at the reflection you see\cb3 \ \cb1 in the mirror it is your perfect self a glimmering you\cb3 \ \cb1 embodying a physical body that makes you feel alive confident and radiant\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to scan yourself in the mirror admiring the perfection of your physical\cb3 \ \cb1 form and notice the way you glisten\cb3 \ \cb1 and then deepen your gaze as you focus in on what radiates out from within\cb3 \ \cb1 your confidence your happiness your vitality and aliveness\cb3 \ \cb1 you are supremely beautiful both inside and out\cb3 \ \cb1 just take a few more moments to revel in this radiant image of yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 knowing that this self will move with you even when the mirror is gone you feel confident to\cb3 \ \cb1 step away from it for now and as you pass it by taking the pathway\cb3 \ \cb1 that leads down to the lush green valley below feel a deep sense of self-appreciation\cb3 \ \cb1 warmth and tenderness rise up within you you sense that your mind spirit and body\cb3 \ \cb1 are in full alignment now and so you are ready to rest deeply for a while\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] your feet carry you to a bright valley\cb3 \ \cb1 and there you find a picnic blanket and a place to rest your head for a while\cb3 \ \cb1 you lower yourself down to the earth resting flat on your back\cb3 \ \cb1 as you gaze up at the blue sky and scattered white clouds\cb3 \ \cb1 thinners cotton above you the sun has disappeared from your view\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly departing for the day to grace another place on this earth\cb3 \ \cb1 hours pass by and soon the sky transforms to orange and purple\cb3 \ \cb1 and then to a deep midnight blue the full moon rises and the stars\cb3 \ \cb1 too\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you gaze up at these planetary neighbors you feel called to set an intention\cb3 \ \cb1 to commit yourself to nourishing and supporting your physical body and all the ways it yearns to be\cb3 \ \cb1 cherished take a moment now to set this intention\cb3 \ \cb1 for your physical appearance and well-being in your words in your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 repeating it to the cosmos three times in silence\cb3 \ \cb1 the stars continue to glisten reflecting the beauty and radiance that is very much\cb3 \ \cb1 alive within you and soon your eyes grow tired\cb3 \ \cb1 your body heavy you scan your body from head to toe letting each body part\cb3 \ \cb1 you pass surrender into the supportive\cb3 \ \cb1 earth\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you close your eyes to the night the visualization of this natural\cb3 \ \cb1 landscape dissipates you come back to the place that holds\cb3 \ \cb1 you by feeling into the supportive surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 just let your entire body relax slowly surrendering completely into\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep you may use your breath as an anchor\cb3 \ \cb1 once again to keep you grounded and present and simultaneously i invite you

\f0\fs22 \cf2 my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 that will help you to wisely let go of any anger you might be\cb3 \ \cb1 experiencing before sleep when held onto anger can inhibit us from feeling into\cb3 \ \cb1 our innate sense of peace and our capacity for compassion\cb3 \ \cb1 and so by becoming mindful of this emotion and addressing it thoughtfully we can\cb3 \ \cb1 loosen its grip and uncover a new way forward\cb3 \ \cb1 so to begin this bedtime meditation take your time to get settled in for the night ensure that your spine is\cb3 \ \cb1 long and straight and your neck becoming an extension of it and then\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your limbs to relax and fall however they are\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable close your eyes as you turn your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention inwards and then note what it feels like to be held by the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 what does it feel like to be tethered by the weight of gravity\cb3 \ \cb1 what does the mattress or other surface beneath you feel like against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 without judging your experience see if you can simply become more intimate with\cb3 \ \cb1 the physical space you rest in\cb3 \ \cb1 and once you feel grounded and completely connected to the physical world i invite\cb3 \ \cb1 you to shift your attention to the air around you you might notice the\cb3 \ \cb1 sensation of it against your cheeks or you might observe the way it\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly enters and exits the body as your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 as each breath fills you you're provided with life-supporting oxygen\cb3 \ \cb1 offered to us by the plant kingdom and with each breath out we return this\cb3 \ \cb1 gift to the plant life in the form of carbon\cb3 \ \cb1 dioxide spend a few moments with your breath now noting how\cb3 \ \cb1 effortless this exchange this flow is\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can allow the chest the shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 and the belly to soften facilitating the flow of the breath and perhaps inviting it\cb3 \ \cb1 a little bit deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 now as we dive into this process of releasing the energy of anger\cb3 \ \cb1 it is worthwhile to begin by softening out judgments of this emotion\cb3 \ \cb1 in and of itself anger is neither good nor bad it is simply a reaction\cb3 \ \cb1 we experience to various circumstances or events in our life what we do\cb3 \ \cb1 with our anger is another thing when left to fest inside or when\cb3 \ \cb1 released mindlessly upon those around us anger can hurt more than it heals\cb3 \ \cb1 however we can also choose to use anger as a signpost for what we value\cb3 \ \cb1 for the direction we wish to move in our lives\cb3 \ \cb1 only when we begin by softening our judgment and opening to this experience with\cb3 \ \cb1 more care and curiosity do we enable ourselves to discover a new\cb3 \ \cb1 way forward so right now i invite you to take a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment to draw your attention to your heart space the center of your chest\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you breathe envision the heart expanding energetically with each\cb3 \ \cb1 breath in and softening its toughest barriers with\cb3 \ \cb1 each breath out\cb3 \ \cb1 with each breath that moves through the heart imagine your judgments of this emotion\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxing as you create more space for it to unravel in a healing and a cleansing way\cb3 \ \cb1 if stories about rightness or wrongness come to mind\cb3 \ \cb1 simply note these as they appear and then release with an out breath for example if we\cb3 \ \cb1 notice ourselves feeling righteous or holding on to the wrong doings of another we might invite\cb3 \ \cb1 these to soften if only just for a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 and this does not mean you'll not be called to take certain wise action in daily life\cb3 \ \cb1 but for now harboring the energy of this anger is likely of little benefit\cb3 \ \cb1 so continue to come back to the breath again and again as needed expanding as you\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale and softening or releasing as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 before we move into the visualization that will help us to cleanse any held anger for the coming night\cb3 \ \cb1 i invite you to mindfully inquire into the energy that lives beneath your anger\cb3 \ \cb1 the energy that this anger arises from\cb3 \ \cb1 sometimes our anger comes from the mind as a yearning to be right\cb3 \ \cb1 or as a defensive reaction other times it arises from our values\cb3 \ \cb1 from care and concern about someone or something\cb3 \ \cb1 and even sometimes it's a mix of these two things a blend of mental and intuitive\cb3 \ \cb1 responses to the world around us so i invite you to take a few moments to\cb3 \ \cb1 compassionately curiously and non-judgmentally inquire into the energies beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 or behind the raw experience of anger and just hold yourself gently as you\cb3 \ \cb1 explore this noting to what extent you might be reacting in defense\cb3 \ \cb1 and to what extent this emotion may be rising out of love\cb3 \ \cb1 when you awaken into another day you can use this self-knowledge to help you\cb3 \ \cb1 navigate your anger in a way that is conducive of deep healing\cb3 \ \cb1 on an individual and collective level but for now let's take some time to just\cb3 \ \cb1 let it all go to reaffirm that in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 we are well that in this moment we can best serve ourselves by inviting\cb3 \ \cb1 our anger to dissolve so take a moment now to come back to\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath for a few cycles\cb3 \ \cb1 use the breath or the body as an anchor for your attention any time you find your mind wandering\cb3 \ \cb1 that does not serve you in this moment just bring it back focusing back on your breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 and once you feel centered i invite you to bring your attention to the creative capacity of your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 and in this space begin to visualize that you are in the midst of an autumn\cb3 \ \cb1 forest surrounded by trees with leaves turning amber\cb3 \ \cb1 mahogany gold and crimson\cb3 \ \cb1 the forest floor beneath your feet is a path of densely packed earth a thin layer of\cb3 \ \cb1 early autumn leaves lays sparse signifying that the turn of seasons is\cb3 \ \cb1 upon you\cb3 \ \cb1 the air is cool but you are dressed warmly for the evening\cb3 \ \cb1 the sky is still a pale blue but you can tell by the glimmer in the\cb3 \ \cb1 trees that the sun will be setting soon\cb3 \ \cb1 before making your way along the path that leads you through the woods\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a moment to plant your feet into the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 reaching the top of your head towards the sky above your heart opens your shoulders relax\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a few long slow deep breaths to ground yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 into this calm and soothing forest\cb3 \ \cb1 you allow your forehead to soften your jaw to unclench\cb3 \ \cb1 your belly to relax and all unnecessary tension to soften\cb3 \ \cb1 and following your next breath out you decide to move forward\cb3 \ \cb1 to venture deeper into the transitioning woods you have arrived in\cb3 \ \cb1 step by step you move along the pathway that guides you through the colorful\cb3 \ \cb1 enchanting landscape the air is crisp and earthy\cb3 \ \cb1 cleansing you with each breath that moves through you\cb3 \ \cb1 small forest critters scurry across the earth and and birds chirp from their cozy nests\cb3 \ \cb1 snuggled in the trees as you admire the harmony of life here\cb3 \ \cb1 in the woods you feel yourself surrendering to it\cb3 \ \cb1 opening up to this moment exactly as it is\cb3 \ \cb1 any weight you've been carrying upon your shoulders begins to lighten\cb3 \ \cb1 guided by the energy of the falling leaves\cb3 \ \cb1 any judgments frustrations concerns or worries that you've been harboring also find their place in the\cb3 \ \cb1 forest dissolving from within your body as you harmonize with the environment around\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 the woods are at peace inviting you to find that tranquil space within yourself as\cb3 \ \cb1 well though the forest is not immune to the\cb3 \ \cb1 challenges of life but now it embraces the harmonious\cb3 \ \cb1 transition from day into night\cb3 \ \cb1 you carry on just a short while before the forest begins to thin\cb3 \ \cb1 and as it does your jaw drops at the radiant beauty that emerges\cb3 \ \cb1 glimmering back into your eyes a silent still pristine lake surrounded by the\cb3 \ \cb1 vibrant foliage of the forest comes into view\cb3 \ \cb1 treading lightly towards the water's edge you find a sandy stretch of shoreline\cb3 \ \cb1 and allow yourself to take a seat\cb3 \ \cb1 from where you rest you admire the reflection of the trees and the still\cb3 \ \cb1 surface of the lake the perfect mirror image softens your\cb3 \ \cb1 heart calling you deeper into the mystery of the world\cb3 \ \cb1 the reflection reminds you that we are all mirrors to one another\cb3 \ \cb1 that everything we face has something to show us about ourselves\cb3 \ \cb1 or about the nature of the world\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can feel your mind softening as you reflect upon this\cb3 \ \cb1 sinking into the silence that holds it all\cb3 \ \cb1 and now as you sit here by the lake you hold yourself and the world\cb3 \ \cb1 in a full embrace without desiring to change anything\cb3 \ \cb1 about this simple moment see if you can open yourself completely to what\cb3 \ \cb1 is\cb3 \ \cb1 the frustrations the judgments anger that you've experienced as being a\cb3 \ \cb1 part of the world now begin to feel distant\cb3 \ \cb1 here amidst the autumn trees and silent lake you are granted with the time and space\cb3 \ \cb1 required for you to process all of those inner energies\cb3 \ \cb1 you trust that as you process them new possibilities for more wise and\cb3 \ \cb1 loving steps to take in days to come will present themselves to you\cb3 \ \cb1 as you gaze out across the water you realize there is nothing that needs\cb3 \ \cb1 to be done in this moment but to continue allowing yourself to surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 and so you lean back allowing your full body to nestle into\cb3 \ \cb1 the sandy shore beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel yourself fully supported here on this small beach by the lake\cb3 \ \cb1 as the sun seeps behind the tree line\cb3 \ \cb1 the orange pink glow of the night radiates throughout the cosmos\cb3 \ \cb1 bringing a warmth to your being\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you rest here you take a moment to inquire with your body\cb3 \ \cb1 about any areas of tension or residual anger that may be longing for your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention drawing your awareness to the crown of your head to begin\cb3 \ \cb1 you slowly scan the body downwards consciously relaxing or inviting a\cb3 \ \cb1 loving breath into each area you pass\cb3 \ \cb1 when you're finished tending to the entire body come back to your breath filling\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself with cleansing crisp air of the surrounding woods that hold you\cb3 \ \cb1 your inner eye is still open to the night sky you watch as the colors deepen\cb3 \ \cb1 soon transitioning into a dark and deep purple\cb3 \ \cb1 the crescent moon appears as do thousands upon thousands of shimmering stars\cb3 \ \cb1 with your entire body relaxed breathe mindfully through the heart\cb3 \ \cb1 space inviting the universal energy of love\cb3 \ \cb1 to fill you on your next breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 and offering your inner love back to the universe on your next breath out\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you gaze up to the night sky take a moment to offer a few silent\cb3 \ \cb1 loving words to yourself grant yourself permission to feel as you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel while bathing yourself in words of love and patience\cb3 \ \cb1 and care and kindness\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now i invite you to repeat the same for someone or something that may have stirred anger within you\cb3 \ \cb1 in recent days and note that this doesn't mean that you\cb3 \ \cb1 need to make right the actions of another it is simply an invitation to\cb3 \ \cb1 where possible send love and care and patience to that which sparks\cb3 \ \cb1 anger within us\cb3 \ \cb1 when you are finished come back to your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 noting how it causes your body to rise and fall as you rest in the silence of this night\cb3 \ \cb1 let all thoughts and all images within the mind dissolve now there is nothing else that\cb3 \ \cb1 needs to be done\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly your eyes begin to close to the cosmos above you and the lake before you\cb3 \ \cb1 your mind's eye becomes clear and you feel your body once again\cb3 \ \cb1 tethered to the physical reality you rest in\cb3 \ \cb1 you take three long slow deep breaths releasing with the sigh as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you are finished with those three breaths just allow your breath to return to its\cb3 \ \cb1 natural rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you move deeper into the night you let yourself go completely\cb3 \ \cb1 getting the past and releasing the future\cb3 \ \cb1 all that matters now is this present moment as well as the energies of love and care\cb3 \ \cb1 curiosity and tenderness and so you allow yourself to be\cb3 \ \cb1 here to be bathed in these soothing energies\cb3 \ \cb1 as you drift into the restful slumber that awaits\cb3 \ \cb1 good night my friend\cb3 \ \cb1 so\cb3 \ \cb1 so\cb3 \ \cb1 hmm\cb3 \ \cb1 hmm\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1

life from a whole new perspective traveling over the estuary you head\cb3 \ \cb1 along the coastline scaling large cliffs flying high above them\cb3 \ \cb1 thin wispy clouds almost transparent from below are blown in from the sea\cb3 \ \cb1 hugging the cliffs as you move higher\cb3 \ \cb1 the clouds wrap themselves around you like gossamer threads the clouds wispy\cb3 \ \cb1 fragile and translucent follow in your trail as you saw ever higher rising\cb3 \ \cb1 vertically now higher and higher looking up towards the moon silvery gray the\cb3 \ \cb1 moon is for you marvel at its beauty and power knowing how it controls the ebb\cb3 \ \cb1 and wane of the tides he is suddenly life seems less\cb3 \ \cb1 complicated there is a sense of pureness of mystery\cb3 \ \cb1 and yet clarity life

you may also find it a tool to help with lucid dreaming as\cb3 \ \cb1 this is another way of entering that incredible state between wakefulness and\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep our minds and bodies are like\cb3 \ \cb1 children and the more we ignore their demands the more they demand our\cb3 \ \cb1 attention so if sleep eludes you then you could be possibly ignoring some\cb3 \ \cb1 demand from your body and your mind the solution there for us to pay attention\cb3 \ \cb1 to them but on your own terms not theirs and that can start with this sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation it's based upon yoga nidra which literally means yogic sleep so\cb3 \ \cb1 let's begin and please lie on your back and keep your arms away from your body with your palms facing up allow your\cb3 \ \cb1 legs to naturally fall apart so that they're not touching each other if\cb3 \ \cb1 you're using a pillow make sure it doesn't elevate your head too much so that it restricts your breathing just a\cb3 \ \cb1 nice comfortable place so your back is as straight as possible but not held\cb3 \ \cb1 rigid now I'd like you to close your eyes and pay attention to your breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale exhale inhale exhale your\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing should be as relaxed and as natural as possible with no significant\cb3 \ \cb1 pauses between each inhalation and exhalation now you don't have to make\cb3 \ \cb1 any attempts to keep your breath even your job is to simply breathe as\cb3 \ \cb1 naturally and comfortably as you can and pay attention to each in-breath and each\cb3 \ \cb1 out breath during this meditation you\cb3 \ \cb1 may find your mind wandering and that is normal our minds do wander your job is\cb3 \ \cb1 just to simply gently bring your focus back to your breathing or to my voice\cb3 \ \cb1 let's begin this

feel your body growing heavier more restful and your thoughts softening\cb3 \ \cb1 into a quiet chatter in the background your imagination comes to life visualize\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself standing in a meadow on a brilliantly warm sunny day wildflowers\cb3 \ \cb1 of all shapes sizes and colors punctuate the soft grass butterflies some small\cb3 \ \cb1 some larger flutter from flower to flower some way off\cb3 \ \cb1 you hear the contented buzz of a honeybee pleased with an afternoon of\cb3 \ \cb1 pollen gathering the soil is soft under your bare feet warmed by the Sun above\cb3 \ \cb1 your head fluffy white clouds Scud across a bright blue sky\cb3 \ \cb1 your heart feels warm filled with gratitude and love for this place even\cb3 \ \cb1 though you have just arrived you are safe here and you are happy take it all\cb3 \ \cb1 in\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the air is warm and the Sun is gentle on your cheeks you feel loose relaxed let\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself sink down into a reclining position your back cushioned by the lush\cb3 \ \cb1 green grass underneath you a butterfly\cb3 \ \cb1 floats overhead moving on to a nearby flower feel the soil underneath your\cb3 \ \cb1 back smell the flowers the grass the\cb3 \ \cb1 dirt all around you\cb3 \ \cb1 see yourself looking upwards watching the clouds move across the sky they to\cb3 \ \cb1 calm you loving your body into an even deeper tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 if you can imagine your body falling asleep in this mirror growing heavier\cb3 \ \cb1 more relaxed your spirit may not want to\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep yet and that is okay perhaps you want to envision your spirits standing\cb3 \ \cb1 back up even as your imaginary body falls into a deep and restful stillness\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and now let your body slumber for a little while as your spirit continues\cb3 \ \cb1 its journey into relaxation your body\cb3 \ \cb1 will rest right here entirely safe entirely secure until you are ready to\cb3 \ \cb1 return to it no harm will come to you during this meditation with this in mind\cb3 \ \cb1 turn your eyes to the horizon at the\cb3 \ \cb1 edge of the meadow you can see a leafy green band of trees standing Sentinel\cb3 \ \cb1 the majestic guardians of this sacred space in your heart you know that there\cb3 \ \cb1 is a tree there's that is taller and larger than the others far more ancient\cb3 \ \cb1 than those that grow around it you feel inexplicably drawn toward it connected\cb3 \ \cb1 at a deep and spiritually significant level you begin to walk towards the edge\cb3 \ \cb1 of this meadow allow yourself to move towards the\cb3 \ \cb1 forest following the path that appears at your feet and leads into the trees as you approach\cb3 \ \cb1 they grow taller and taller in your vision beginning as the size of your\cb3 \ \cb1 smallest finger in the distance but soon towering over your head\cb3 \ \cb1 with a calm wisdom that permeates your entire being as you step under the\cb3 \ \cb1 canopy you feel any stress or strain you're carrying begin to loosen falling\cb3 \ \cb1 away in the same way dried leaves fall from the boughs of the maple in autumn\cb3 \ \cb1 everything you let go of drifts away disappearing already decomposing into\cb3 \ \cb1 the soil that will nurture the trees here for years to come\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the sunshine here is less bright dappled\cb3 \ \cb1 and soft instead of its usual brash gold\cb3 \ \cb1 the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to\cb3 \ \cb1 and yet it is a soothing coolness filled\cb3 \ \cb1 with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss all around you stand\cb3 \ \cb1 the trunks of trees and saplings some tall and smooth others old and knild\cb3 \ \cb1 there are younger trees too skinny and gangly as they grow towards sunlight let\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself sense the slow determination of these trees anchored by roots as long as\cb3 \ \cb1 the tree is tall the trees are content\cb3 \ \cb1 to simply be here calm and strong against the weather they welcome you\cb3 \ \cb1 into their presence greet you as one just as ancient and wise as they are\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as you breathe deeply watching the\cb3 \ \cb1 sunlight meander back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze bring your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention back to your spiritual self the tree sense that there is something\cb3 \ \cb1 you still carry with you a mental or emotional weight that troubles you even\cb3 \ \cb1 in this place it is safe to understand it here perhaps you are mourning the end\cb3 \ \cb1 of a relationship or struggling with a relationship that exists now maybe you\cb3 \ \cb1 are tired after a long journey toward a still unreached goal\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps you worry about money or health either for yourself or for someone else\cb3 \ \cb1 you might carry guilt or regret bitterness or perhaps even hatred\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] whatever appears does not make you evil\cb3 \ \cb1 but is a sign of yourself outgrowing something that once used to fit there's\cb3 \ \cb1 no need to judge yourself here but instead calmly regard whatever appears\cb3 \ \cb1 in your mind and spirit [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let whatever this may be surface within you and when you have looked at it from\cb3 \ \cb1 every angle imagine as a handful of mud\cb3 \ \cb1 materializing in your hands as you look\cb3 \ \cb1 at it a breeze appears drying it out\cb3 \ \cb1 turning it to dust blowing it away from you into the trees your palms are clean\cb3 \ \cb1 and no trace remains of this worry or concern in your heart [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 feel the way the sunlight darts about moving with the fluttering leaves but\cb3 \ \cb1 also heeling wherever your soul may be hurting first the wind cleansed you of\cb3 \ \cb1 any emotional pain and now allow the Sun to heal you whatever may be aching\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue your walk down the path hearing the distant chatter of squirrels\cb3 \ \cb1 and the occasional chirp of birds the\cb3 \ \cb1 path leads you onwards as you take in the sounds sights and smells of the\cb3 \ \cb1 forest drawing you onward until you reach the oldest tree in the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 this particular tree has a trunk so large that a cave has been carved out\cb3 \ \cb1 within the middle of it a perfect place for quiet reflection and contemplation\cb3 \ \cb1 its bark is smooth with a goldish sheen and far far overhead the leaves dance in\cb3 \ \cb1 the breeze with an almost silvery tint this tree is tall taller than any of the\cb3 \ \cb1 others taller than the tallest building you have ever seen you sense its\cb3 \ \cb1 benevolence the warmth with which it welcomes you invite you into its\cb3 \ \cb1 magnificent cave deep within the girth of its trunk except its invitation you\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to enter the cave knowing you are completely safe\cb3 \ \cb1 although it's somewhat dark there are lit candles within already illuminating\cb3 \ \cb1 the inside of this ancient tree your\cb3 \ \cb1 soul grows light or with each step as the cool darkness of the woods gives way\cb3 \ \cb1 again to the healing candle light within the cave helping you to relax deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 almost instantly you feel calm wiser and\cb3 \ \cb1 safe you feel an old familiar feeling a\cb3 \ \cb1 serenity that you have not had for such a long while from the cave you can see\cb3 \ \cb1 out to the entire forest witnessing the bobbing leaves of the other trees nearby\cb3 \ \cb1 and a squirrel scampering about far off\cb3 \ \cb1 in the distance a brightly colored swath of grass and flowers catches your eye it\cb3 \ \cb1 is the meadow and you can see your physical body resting totally and\cb3 \ \cb1 completely on this blissful summer's day\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to enjoy the tranquility of the cave and the view of the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 feel a breeze into the cave and ruffle your hair and watch the Magnificent\cb3 \ \cb1 scenery around you from this position\cb3 \ \cb1 you can understand and see anything you like stay here\cb3 \ \cb1 peaceful tranquil for as long as you like and if you would like allow your\cb3 \ \cb1 spirit journey back through the forest and back to the meadow where you sink\cb3 \ \cb1 down beside your physical

\f0\fs22 \cf2 it has been said that one hour of yoga nidra equates to four hours of deep\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep because we go through all of the brainwave stages you typically go\cb3 \ \cb1 through during sleep only in a compressed amount of time using this\cb3 \ \cb1 systematic approach to full body and mind relaxation can help you connect\cb3 \ \cb1 with your own true and natural wisdom your ability for healing and relieving\cb3 \ \cb1 stress if you are feeling stressed this practice can be just what you need to\cb3 \ \cb1 experience inner peace and joy it is also a great way to help you fall asleep\cb3 \ \cb1 and sleep deeply if you practice before bed get ready to heal and restore your\cb3 \ \cb1 body quiet your mind and bring compassion and love into your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 hello and welcome I'm Sara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are on\cb3 \ \cb1 Oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and\cb3 \ \cb1 the ability for self healing before you begin to settle into your comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 yoga nidra posture it is important for you to set a specific intention or\cb3 \ \cb1 personal resolve for the practice so you can commit to it at the start let it\cb3 \ \cb1 sink into your subconscious during and revisit it when the practice is coming\cb3 \ \cb1 to a close this intention is called a San culpa this San culpa can help you make a\cb3 \ \cb1 positive change in your life as your brain enters delta-wave frequencies where you are very receptive to change\cb3 \ \cb1 for your San culpa choose something that aligns with your deepest desires\cb3 \ \cb1 this statement is positive in nature and is in the present tense you may choose\cb3 \ \cb1 to start the statement using the words I am as you are solidifying your intention\cb3 \ \cb1 feel it in your heart as if it is true\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps imagine what your life might be like when it is true you can keep the\cb3 \ \cb1 same San culpa for as long as you like and come back to this practice frequently to send a consistent message\cb3 \ \cb1 to your subconscious feel free to pause this recording to take time to set your\cb3 \ \cb1 intention maybe write it down on a small piece of paper to keep with you after\cb3 \ \cb1 your practice is complete now I would\cb3 \ \cb1 like to take a brief moment to give you some suggestions for your setup as it is\cb3 \ \cb1 important to be extremely comfortable and feel safe in the position you choose\cb3 \ \cb1 for your yoga nidra practice you can choose to lie down on the floor or in\cb3 \ \cb1 your bed for this practice you will want to be fully supported the intent is not\cb3 \ \cb1 to go to sleep it is to relax your body fully so you can relax your mind and let\cb3 \ \cb1 go of stress you may choose to have your head and shoulders slightly elevated to\cb3 \ \cb1 make sure you stay awake you can use a yoga bolster a pillow a rolled blanket\cb3 \ \cb1 or towel under your knees to make sure there is no strain in your lower back\cb3 \ \cb1 you may like a pillow or a blanket under your head as well and I recommend\cb3 \ \cb1 covering up with a blanket as your body temperature will drop as you become more\cb3 \ \cb1 and more relaxed and finally if you like you can\cb3 \ \cb1 cover your eyes with a washcloth or eye pillow\cb3 \ \cb1 now I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes if

temperature of the air around you\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your attention to move inward for a moment and discover a safe place\cb3 \ \cb1 within a place where you feel secure and\cb3 \ \cb1 loved this may be a feeling within your body\cb3 \ \cb1 or a visualization of an actual place where you feel safe know that you may\cb3 \ \cb1 return your attention to this place anytime you need it\cb3 \ \cb1 now in

tranquility that\cb3 \ \cb1 comes with it in this space your hands\cb3 \ \cb1 rest on your knees palm up they are\cb3 \ \cb1 receptive to whatever emotions arise in\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself a feeling good or bad appears\cb3 \ \cb1 in your heart and as it does you begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to notice a paper lantern hovering just\cb3 \ \cb1 above your palms growing slowly less\cb3 \ \cb1 translucent as you become more familiar\cb3 \ \cb1 with the emotion within you let whatever\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel fill your consciousness passing\cb3 \ \cb1 through you and into the lantern without\cb3 \ \cb1 judgment or fear

\cb1 Oh\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 there is a candle nestled within this\cb3 \ \cb1 Lantern and as you allow this emotion to\cb3 \ \cb1 flow through you a small flame appears\cb3 \ \cb1 with your every breath it grows a bit\cb3 \ \cb1 stronger until a cheerful tongue of\cb3 \ \cb1 flame illuminates the paper that\cb3 \ \cb1 shelters it from the wind no matter how\cb3 \ \cb1 an emotion affects you it is beautiful\cb3 \ \cb1 and unique just as this lantern is\cb3 \ \cb1 exquisite in its simplicity take a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment to say thank you to the wisdom\cb3 \ \cb1 this feeling has brought you as you\cb3 \ \cb1 carried it along your daily journey\cb3 \ \cb1 these past weeks or years feel gratitude\cb3 \ \cb1 for it slight well-up in your chest a\cb3 \ \cb1 warmth radiating from your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 outwards and then when you are ready\cb3 \ \cb1 whisper goodbye as the lantern begins to\cb3 \ \cb1 lift away from your palms it floats\cb3 \ \cb1 higher bobbing gently in the breeze as\cb3 \ \cb1 it floats upwards stopping high above\cb3 \ \cb1 your head its candle flame is golden\cb3 \ \cb1 against the inky night sky the light\cb3 \ \cb1 rippling on the surface of the water\cb3 \ \cb1 admire it for a moment and then return\cb3 \ \cb1 to your hands as another lantern perhaps\cb3 \ \cb1 a different color or pattern begins to\cb3 \ \cb1 materialize just above them\cb3 \ \cb1 feel the emotions run through you and\cb3 \ \cb1 when you are ready release this lantern\cb3 \ \cb1 and any others that follow it into the\cb3 \ \cb1 sky watching a constellation of candle\cb3 \ \cb1 lights appearing in the sky and the\cb3 \ \cb1 rivers reflection you are surrounded by\cb3 \ \cb1 lights\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1

golden warmth these\cb3 \ \cb1 are the feelings that you have carried\cb3 \ \cb1 with you the emotions that have taught\cb3 \ \cb1 you much but are no longer useful on\cb3 \ \cb1 your journey they are magnificent but\cb3 \ \cb1 they are temporary and you may let them\cb3 \ \cb1 go take a moment to thank them again for\cb3 \ \cb1 their presence and their guidance and\cb3 \ \cb1 when you are ready sigh out your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 in a long slow wash as you do so the\cb3 \ \cb1 lanterns Bob gently and begin to float\cb3 \ \cb1 upwards lights growing smaller and\cb3 \ \cb1 smaller until they are like tiny\cb3 \ \cb1 pinpricks in the sky one by one they\cb3 \ \cb1 disappear from view carried far out into\cb3 \ \cb1 space to dance with the Stars you are\cb3 \ \cb1 free\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \

We will start in a seated posture, and then move onto a lying posture later on.\cb3 \ \cb1 Please find a comfortable seated position on your bed. It might help to add a pillow\cb3 \ \cb1 under you for support. ...\cb3 \ \cb1 Rest your hands on your knees, with your palms facing up. Close your eyes.\cb3 \ \cb1 Take a moment to feel your body, and feel the natural flow of your breath.\cb3 \ \cb1 ...\cb3 \ \cb1 Regardless of what happened in your day, it is time to let it go. Release your day, release\cb3 \ \cb1 all the worries, release all the stress. You don't need it anymore.\cb3 \ \cb1 We'll take 5 deep breaths, with an open mouth exhale. When you inhale, think of peace. When\cb3 \ \cb1 you exhale, let go of any tension that you may be holding onto, both in your body and\cb3 \ \cb1 in your mind. With each exhale, find a deeper & deeper level of release.\cb3 \ \cb1 Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling up the space in the bottom of your belly...\cb3 \ \cb1 Then a deep exhale out through your mouth, releasing all the worries and tension from\cb3 \ \cb1 your day.\cb3 \ \cb1 Take another deep breath in through your nose, breathing in peace,\cb3 \ \cb1 And a big exhale out through your mouth, exhaling all the stress...\cb3 \ \cb1 Deep inhale through your nose, let the air reach deep into your belly...\cb3 \ \cb1 And a deep exhale out through your mouth, letting go...\cb3 \ \cb1 Another deep inhale through your nose,\cb3 \ \cb1 Exhale and let it all out... feel your body soften & relax...\cb3 \ \cb1 Final deep breathe in... inviting peace...\cb3 \ \cb1 And exhale... drop your shoulders and release...\cb3 \ \cb1 Become aware of how your body feels now. And how your breath grows slower and deeper as\cb3 \ \cb1 you relax. ....\cb3 \ \cb1 The mind and body are one. When our mind relaxes, our body relaxes, and vice versa. When we\cb3 \ \cb1 feel stress or anxiety, our bodies hold onto these emotions as physical tension, and it\cb3 \ \cb1 makes it harder for us to relax and sleep well.\cb3 \ \cb1 Every night, make time to clear your mind and relax your body. This is your time to\cb3 \ \cb1 love and nurture your mind, body, and soul.\cb3 \ \cb1 Now, we will do some gentle stretches to further relax the body.\cb3 \ \cb1 Let's start with some neck stretches.\cb3 \ \cb1 Take a deep breath in\'85 And on your exhale, bring your chin down to stretch the back of\cb3 \ \cb1 your neck. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your hands behind your head.\cb3 \ \cb1 Hold here for two full breaths, breathing through the tension with each exhale.\cb3 \ \cb1 On your next exhale bring your chin to neutral and face forward.\cb3 \ \cb1 Onto side neck stretches. Gently tilt your head to the right, and hold for three deep\cb3 \ \cb1 breaths. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your right hand on your head\'85\cb3 \ \cb1 Reset on your 3rd breath.\cb3 \ \cb1 Now do the opposite side. Tilt your head slowly to the left, and hold for three deep breaths....\cb3 \ \cb1 Reset on your next exhale\'85\cb3 \ \cb1 Now let's do a couple neck circles on each side.. While inhaling, slowly roll your head\cb3 \ \cb1 to the right, back, then exhale to the left, and then down\'85 gently at your own pace,\cb3 \ \cb1 do one more round\'85inhaling for the first half, exhaling for the 2nd half.....\cb3 \ \cb1 Now switch directions. Slowly circle your neck the other way, inhaling to the left,\cb3 \ \cb1 back, exhaling to the right, and down. Repeat for one more round\'85\cb3 \ \cb1 When you\'92re done, take a deep breath and open mouth exhale to reset.\cb3 \ \cb1 Next, do 5 shoulder rolls in each direction. Inhale and bring your shoulders forward and\cb3 \ \cb1 up, then roll them back then down. Repeat this circular motion four more times, deep\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing throughout....\cb3 \ \cb1 Now roll your shoulders 5 times in the the opposite direction, deep breathing throughout\cb3 \ \cb1 and loosening up your shoulder muscles. ....\cb3 \ \cb1 Take a deep breath and reset. Notice how your body feels now.\cb3 \ \cb1 Now that you've begun stretching, listen to your body. Where else would you like to stretch\cb3 \ \cb1 and release tension? Follow your intuition and what your body craves....\cb3 \ \cb1 Maybe you want to stretch your legs and reach for your toes. Maybe you want to lay down\cb3 \ \cb1 and do some spinal twists.

equal\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing we refer to this exercise as\cb3 \ \cb1 equal breathing because our inhales\cb3 \ \cb1 holds and exhales will all be equal\cb3 \ \cb1 amounts of time each breathing cycle\cb3 \ \cb1 will incrementally increase in length as\cb3 \ \cb1 we progress both inhales and exhales\cb3 \ \cb1 will be through your nose for every\cb3 \ \cb1 breath start breathing through your nose\cb3 \ \cb1 now this breathing method is effective\cb3 \ \cb1 in calming the nervous system relaxing\cb3 \ \cb1 your mind and reducing stress it is\cb3 \ \cb1 especially effective when trying

\ \cb1 see how much tension there is to let go\cb3 \ \cb1 of there feel the light tingle in your\cb3 \ \cb1 arches and toes that's the relief of not\cb3 \ \cb1 having to hold the body to wait any\cb3 \ \cb1 longer as you continue to scan your body\cb3 \ \cb1 moving up from the feet let the rest of\cb3 \ \cb1 your muscles follow suit relaxing one by\cb3 \ \cb1 one it's time to give up and let

four different environments exploring peace\cb3 \ \cb1 and relaxation in the context of each one of them at the end you will have the\cb3 \ \cb1 freedom to select the right one for you attuning your spiritual surroundings to\cb3 \ \cb1 what you need for health healing and your happiness\cb3 \ \cb1 with this in mind allow a calm sense of expectation to rise in your mind and set\cb3 \ \cb1 an intention to rest deeply and completely feel your body relaxed more\cb3 \ \cb1 than it has in a long while all the tension in your body dissolving bit by\cb3 \ \cb1 bit let every muscle in your body relax\cb3 \ \cb1 even those in the place you normally hold tired this may be your forehead\cb3 \ \cb1 your lips or jaw the back of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 your shoulder blades your lower back\cb3 \ \cb1 your belly your knees or ankles and\cb3 \ \cb1 right down to the tendons in your feet\cb3 \ \cb1 feel your whole body melt into wherever you rest and allow the surface around\cb3 \ \cb1 you to support your body let's begin our\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation so lying down keeping your\cb3 \ \cb1 back straight as much as you can feel your body becoming more serene you are\cb3 \ \cb1 still and peaceful in this breath and the next as you relax you begin to hear\cb3 \ \cb1 the crash of water in the distance\cb3 \ \cb1 as you sink a little deeper into relaxation it grows louder until you\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself are standing on the banks of an enormous waterfall\cb3 \ \cb1 it is morning and the sunlight catches the water as it falls creating thousands\cb3 \ \cb1 of tiny rainbows in the spray around the cliff\cb3 \ \cb1 the rumble of moving water is at once both soothing and awe-inspiring a\cb3 \ \cb1 symphony of Earth's very essence tumbling around you take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in this majesty\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as you look more closely at the\cb3 \ \cb1 waterfall bill the cool mist envelop your face leaving dewy droplets on your\cb3 \ \cb1 cheeks and Florida feel the vitality and\cb3 \ \cb1 power of this place all around you in the warmth of the cliff bases\cb3 \ \cb1 the gentle glow of the Sun the frothy\cb3 \ \cb1 water around the Falls notice yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 becoming karma beginning to let go of your worries and physical tension\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to breathe letting the rush of the water guide you\cb3 \ \cb1 into a deeper relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to feel the slow transitions from inhale to exhale and\cb3 \ \cb1 from exhale to inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 note the tiny delicate paws in the center of these transitions that space\cb3 \ \cb1 where inhalation ends but before exhalation begins\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe as deeply or as shallowly as comfortable for you your chest moving\cb3 \ \cb1 rhythmically and effortlessly as you sink a little deeper into relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 letting go of any worry or stress\cb3 \ \cb1 if at any time your mind wanders simply bring it gently back to your breath a\cb3 \ \cb1 calming gentle process of bringing air into your lungs feel any tension in your\cb3 \ \cb1 body lift away with every breath you take nothing can hurt you here\cb3 \ \cb1 enjoy these next few moments next to the waterfall letting your worries dissolve\cb3 \ \cb1 under the relentless rumble of fresh rainwater\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you notice the sounds of the meditation begin to change allow your\cb3 \ \cb1 imagination to follow your feelings to follow creating around you a magnificent\cb3 \ \cb1 sandy beach waves break in crystalline\cb3 \ \cb1 sprays and the call of seagulls eases your mind smell the sharp tang of salt\cb3 \ \cb1 and the warm dustiness of hot sand\cb3 \ \cb1 let your shoulders droop and your fora done crease\cb3 \ \cb1 in the background you can hear the wash of the ocean waves breaking on the beach\cb3 \ \cb1 you can watch the water if you like or close your imaginary eyes and simply\cb3 \ \cb1 dwell in the presence of your other senses breathe and listen let everything\cb3 \ \cb1 else go\cb3 \ \cb1 so much of meditation is the practice of letting go of accepting that you cannot\cb3 \ \cb1 control everything around you of welcoming in the infinite glorious\cb3 \ \cb1 possibilities and opportunities that are waiting for you letting go of your\cb3 \ \cb1 conscious discipline your task oriented nature is the gateway to relaxation so\cb3 \ \cb1 taking a breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 and exhale letting go of the need to\cb3 \ \cb1 control your experience just for a few\cb3 \ \cb1 minutes allow yourself to feel whatever arises letting go of everything negative\cb3 \ \cb1 and treasuring the beauty of this moment's experience\cb3 \ \cb1 as your body lets go of any tension your breath slows down and it may deepen just\cb3 \ \cb1 a slight bit simply follow its rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 listening to the quiet in and out of air in your lungs if you would like match\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath to the tempo of the sea nearby following the rise and fall of\cb3 \ \cb1 the waves behind whatever feels most\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable most relaxing and embrace it\cb3 \ \cb1 this is your chance to discover and choose whatever you need to rest\cb3 \ \cb1 most fully\cb3 \ \cb1 and again as the music and sounds of this meditation begin to change allow\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to be transported to the banks of a freshwater brook or river where\cb3 \ \cb1 fish jump and the sunlight glints on the wet rocks\cb3 \ \cb1 as you take a deep inhale you breathe in the burbling sound of water on stones\cb3 \ \cb1 and the gentle sigh of wind in the young tree boughs take another deep breath and\cb3 \ \cb1 then release it relishing the warmth of the air that leaves your body feel your\cb3 \ \cb1 feet sink into the soft grass of the riverbank and notice the bright green\cb3 \ \cb1 color of early spring if you would like\cb3 \ \cb1 you may dip your foot into the stream noticing the way the water washes over\cb3 \ \cb1 your toes cooling your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 you can hear a few honeybees buzzing about enjoying the landscape as much as\cb3 \ \cb1 you are you know that the bees will not harm you and so you can continue to\cb3 \ \cb1 enjoy the gentle harmony they make a soft sound that sets off the silver\cb3 \ \cb1 tinkling music of the creek\cb3 \ \cb1 a little way in front of you a butterfly flutters on the breeze dipping and\cb3 \ \cb1 soaring with the invisible current of the wind you hold out your hand and it\cb3 \ \cb1 floats closer to you landing on your skin with an almost imperceptible touch\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to lay down on the riverbanks feeling the way the grass\cb3 \ \cb1 molds around your body supporting your back and neck so you can relax more\cb3 \ \cb1 completely above you you can see a\cb3 \ \cb1 fluffy white cloud a clear blue sky\cb3 \ \cb1 all around you are the sounds of nature peaceful and rhythmic\cb3 \ \cb1 your thoughts disappeared replaced by this music of nature you can feel all\cb3 \ \cb1 the aches and pains in your body dissolve away as you sink a little deeper into the warm grass relaxed and\cb3 \ \cb1 at peace in this beautiful landscape give yourself permission to enjoy it\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe you feel yourself growing lighter more relaxed almost as if the\cb3 \ \cb1 stresses and tensions of the day are being washed away in the cheerful sound\cb3 \ \cb1 of the river\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in welcoming inspiration and peace breathe out\cb3 \ \cb1 exhaling worry and fear this is your\cb3 \ \cb1 time embrace it now in these next few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 and now as the music and sounds around you change one small breathe in and find\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself on the path of a majestic and ancient forest the trail through the\cb3 \ \cb1 forest is verdant lined with the carpet of the grass your feet sink into it's\cb3 \ \cb1 slightly brushing against the soft coolness of its surface birds sing in\cb3 \ \cb1 the trees a symphony of natural beauty\cb3 \ \cb1 some chirp back and forth others trill\cb3 \ \cb1 melodies into the wind a gentle breeze\cb3 \ \cb1 sways in the trees and the soft touch of its passing soothes your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 the sunshine is less bright here dappled and soft instead of its usual brash gold\cb3 \ \cb1 the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to\cb3 \ \cb1 and yet it is a soothing coolness filled\cb3 \ \cb1 with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you walk further and deeper into the forest the trees become larger their\cb3 \ \cb1 trunks wider and spaced further apart in\cb3 \ \cb1 the resulting space hangs a mantle of pearly fog floating a few feet above the\cb3 \ \cb1 ground as you walk your legs stir the\cb3 \ \cb1 fog and it swirls around you gauzy tendrils lazy soft against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 birdsong accompanies you along your journey lifting your spirit and soothing\cb3 \ \cb1 your body with its innocent sounds let\cb3 \ \cb1 your self marvel at the size of these trees as wide around as dining tables\cb3 \ \cb1 and almost taller than your eyes can see\cb3 \ \cb1 smell the dampness of believes and dirt underneath them nourishing and\cb3 \ \cb1 protecting their roots imagine how far\cb3 \ \cb1 these tree's roots must extend into the earth in order to remain sturdy and\cb3 \ \cb1 upright above all allow the nature's\cb3 \ \cb1 music to guide you into further relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe deeply watching the sunlight meander back and forth as the\cb3 \ \cb1 trees sway in the breeze bring your attention to yourself are you holding\cb3 \ \cb1 any tension or is there any pain in your body are you carrying or holding on to\cb3 \ \cb1 something in your back your neck or your\cb3 \ \cb1 shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 is there tension in your hips or perhaps the way you squeeze your eyelid shut how\cb3 \ \cb1 does it feel to be you right now\cb3 \ \cb1 you are still and tranquil United with this peaceful an ageless environment\cb3 \ \cb1 feel your body relaxing as you breathe a little deeper letting go of anything\cb3 \ \cb1 that might distract you let yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 focus completely on the beauty of the forest sense it feel what it's like\cb3 \ \cb1 welcoming the harmony and stillness that accompanies it\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your attention to travel across your body noticing how deeply your\cb3 \ \cb1 muscles and tendons have relaxed since\cb3 \ \cb1 now the space between your thoughts the\cb3 \ \cb1 ease with which your mind moves between thoughts never lingering too long on one\cb3 \ \cb1 subject you feel calm peaceful and\cb3 \ \cb1 daddy's now in this state of quiet peace\cb3 \ \cb1 as this meditation spoken part comes to an end allow your mind to return to that\cb3 \ \cb1 place savoring the beautiful details as you sink further into this state of\cb3 \ \cb1 happy equanimity let your breath guide you and enjoy the final moments of music\cb3 \ \cb1 as you drift off into a deep and peaceful sleep rest well my friend rest\cb3 \ \cb1 well you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the chakras and your higher self guided meditation hello and welcome to this\cb3 \ \cb1 guided meditation my name is Jason Stevenson and thank you for taking the\cb3 \ \cb1 time to join me and trusting in my work\cb3 \ \cb1 this meditation will consist of a body relaxation to begin with followed by the\cb3 \ \cb1 spoken chakra and communing with your higher self too often we get so caught\cb3 \ \cb1 up in our lives that we forget to really live and really living means existing\cb3 \ \cb1 beyond the confines and demands of schedules immediate wants and needs the\cb3 \ \cb1 expectations of others and the need to conform\cb3 \ \cb1 I wonder if you can remember what it was like as a child what it was like to just\cb3 \ \cb1 be to live and to be joyful without a\cb3 \ \cb1 question to live free of doubt and self-criticism\cb3 \ \cb1 it's all about being in the moment enjoying it free of expectations and\cb3 \ \cb1 just being alive William Blake put it best when he wrote\cb3 \ \cb1 to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in\cb3 \ \cb1 the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour it's\cb3 \ \cb1 and so beautiful but I guess we think but how can you hold infinity in the\cb3 \ \cb1 palm of your hand and eternity in an hour is it even possible\cb3 \ \cb1 yes it is true.you exists in all things and all\cb3 \ \cb1 things exist within you when you truly understand that you experience the\cb3 \ \cb1 entire universe within yourself and yourself as the entire universe once you\cb3 \ \cb1 experience that then you grasp that heaven already dwells within you as does\cb3 \ \cb1 infinity within that heaven lies all possibility\cb3 \ \cb1 and all joy and with that infinite space lies infinite wisdom and infinite power\cb3 \ \cb1 all begins with breath the bridge between your smaller self and your\cb3 \ \cb1 higher self let's begin just finding a comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 place either seated or lying down making sure there are no distractions for the\cb3 \ \cb1 next 30 minutes or so and just breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 in and out now through your nose and seeing if you can slow your breath down\cb3 \ \cb1 to a count of three so breathing in on a count of three through your nose and\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing that breath on a count of three so it's inhaling one two three exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 one two three and just see if you can\cb3 \ \cb1 keep a steady rhythm similar to this but that's comfortable for you the remainder\cb3 \ \cb1 of this meditation we'll begin with a body scan now just\cb3 \ \cb1 becoming aware of your body and starting at the top of your head noticing any\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations here the density and the\cb3 \ \cb1 space this area takes up\cb3 \ \cb1 and including in that awareness as your phorid I'm aware of this area\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] without judgment just being aware and\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling any sensations that may arise [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and taking in and awareness of your eyes your ears your nose and cheeks\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] your mouth and lips or teeth the entire\cb3 \ \cb1 face\cb3 \ \cb1 sensing any sensations even sensing\cb3 \ \cb1 where the air meets your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 and becoming aware moment by moment if\cb3 \ \cb1 any sensations or feelings that you feel come and go and during this time if your\cb3 \ \cb1 mind wanders that's simply okay just allow it to be your only role is to\cb3 \ \cb1 simply acknowledge your thought if it wanders and then come back to focusing\cb3 \ \cb1 on the parts of your body my voice and\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations that you feel [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 so we're going to shift that focus now from the top of your head and your face\cb3 \ \cb1 moving it down to the neck your shoulders you might even feel your\cb3 \ \cb1 shoulders relaxed a little this is a place where we store a lot of tension\cb3 \ \cb1 our shoulders and our shoulder blades\cb3 \ \cb1 also being aware of your neck and your throat area\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you're sensing what is going on here\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you might even be able to feel air\cb3 \ \cb1 coming and going in the throat area\cb3 \ \cb1 moving down now to focus on your arms\cb3 \ \cb1 elbows [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and your forearms [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and down to your wrists and your hands\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] your hands may be either resting on your\cb3 \ \cb1 lap or at your side\cb3 \ \cb1 right down to your fingertips\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can sense the weight of your hands and each individual finger\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and any sensations that you may feel\cb3 \ \cb1 just being aware moment by moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and shifting your awareness now up to your chest area\cb3 \ \cb1 you may sense the rise and fall of your chest the subtle rise and fall\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and bringing your awareness to your\cb3 \ \cb1 ribcage the front the sides of your\cb3 \ \cb1 ribcage and ride around your upper back its\cb3 \ \cb1 resting either against the chair or on the mattress of your bed\cb3 \ \cb1 if you sense any tension or aches or pains just bring a gentle awareness to\cb3 \ \cb1 this\cb3 \ \cb1 not forcing any pain or aches away but rather just simply being aware\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 moving that awareness down now to the abdomen area your stomach\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling sensations here you may feel it\cb3 \ \cb1 softening releasing\cb3 \ \cb1 and just the chest you may feel your\cb3 \ \cb1 belly rising and falling as the air comes and goes\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever you feel whatever you sense just be open and aware and accept\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and shifting that awareness now to the\cb3 \ \cb1 lower back area [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you may send some pressure here [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and continue to shift your focus to the pelvis area your buttocks\cb3 \ \cb1 being aware the space that this takes up\cb3 \ \cb1 the air against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 any sensations that you may feel allow\cb3 \ \cb1 them to come and go with full acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue now to bring your awareness to your thighs the top of your thighs\cb3 \ \cb1 besides inner thighs and underneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 may feel the pressure of where you're laying or seated\cb3 \ \cb1 sensing the weight of your legs\cb3 \ \cb1 if your mind begins to wander at all that's okay just simply bring it back now to\cb3 \ \cb1 focusing on your thighs\cb3 \ \cb1 and moving now down to focusing on your knees the top bony part of your knee and\cb3 \ \cb1 the inner fleshy part underneath\cb3 \ \cb1 in full awareness just accepting\cb3 \ \cb1 anything that comes and goes any sensations feelings thoughts with full\cb3 \ \cb1 acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you may become aware of some discomfort or pain that is okay to just be with\cb3 \ \cb1 this [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 moving your attention now to your calf muscles of both legs\cb3 \ \cb1 if you were lying down in bed you may feel the calf muscles spread against\cb3 \ \cb1 your bed [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and shifting around your shins\cb3 \ \cb1 and finally bringing your attention to both of your feet the soles of your feet\cb3 \ \cb1 any pressure that's attending here the\cb3 \ \cb1 breach of both feet\cb3 \ \cb1 ankles and right down to your toes each single\cb3 \ \cb1 toe you may even sense the space between\cb3 \ \cb1 each toe [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 just checking in on your breathing now\cb3 \ \cb1 and feeling this breath sustaining you\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing in and out throughout your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and seeing if you can take in now the awareness of your entire body from your\cb3 \ \cb1 feet all the way up to the top of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] accepting all that is\cb3 \ \cb1 without judgment just being aware\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] just stay with this for a few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 and allow yourself to relax further\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I'd like you to bring your focus now to the base of your spine\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and Eli's your first chakra the part of\cb3 \ \cb1 you that says I am\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can bring your breath here and give thanks for your

[Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I'd like you to now bring your attention to the spot just below your belly button\cb3 \ \cb1 this is your second chakra the part of yourself that says by desire and see if\cb3 \ \cb1 you can breathe into this point and give thanks for your existence as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 mentally say to yourself by desire and\cb3 \ \cb1 just stay with this for a few breaths\cb3 \ \cb1

exhale mentally say to yourself I act and keep this breath going here for\cb3 \ \cb1 a few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 focusing now on your solar plexus and this is located just beneath the\cb3 \ \cb1 midpoint

\cb1 shifting your awareness now to pay attention to your entire length of your spine visualize it as a white pillar of\cb3 \ \cb1 light whose bottom starts at the base of your spine\cb3 \ \cb1 rising up through your body\cb3 \ \cb1 up past your neck rises through the middle of your head and right to the top\cb3 \ \cb1 of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 if it helps you can imagine that your entire body is a pole made of pure white\cb3 \ \cb1 light one end of that light rises up\cb3 \ \cb1 through the middle topmost part of your head stretching many miles above you\cb3 \ \cb1 with your eyes raised as high as you can comfortably lift try to see where that\cb3 \ \cb1 light goes as it rises up past the roof of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 although that beam of light goes off into eternity there is a sort of barrier\cb3 \ \cb1 that lies some 12 inches above your head this is the eighth chakra also called\cb3 \ \cb1 the great sound from your perspective it might look like\cb3 \ \cb1 an umbrella or as if you were sitting beneath a great transparent jellyfish\cb3 \ \cb1 loading some 12 inches above your head\cb3 \ \cb1 it's also called the witness the part of you that's attached to your body but\cb3 \ \cb1 isn't in your body [Music] this witness is the midway point between\cb3 \ \cb1 your physical self and your higher self which has never been born and can never\cb3 \ \cb1 die you might like to think of it as a boy\cb3 \ \cb1 bobbing on the water's surface beneath that boy is a string attached to the\cb3 \ \cb1 oceans floor the beam of light that starts at the base of your spine and\cb3 \ \cb1 shoots out through the top of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 between the boy on the water's surface and the anchor that keeps it bound to\cb3 \ \cb1 the oceans for liars and not and that knot is the witness connecting your\cb3 \ \cb1 physical body your highest self which never lives and never dies\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] rising up that beam of light that point\cb3 \ \cb1 some 12 inches above your head is a light body it's a detached version of\cb3 \ \cb1 you one that knows your likes and dislikes your passions and urges it\cb3 \ \cb1 doesn't judge you simply observes and record your thoughts and your feelings\cb3 \ \cb1 without thinking or feeling them [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as the witness you sent your body below\cb3 \ \cb1 feel it breathing gently beneath you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you witness you feel and see the line of light\cb3 \ \cb1 stretching forth above you toward infinity\cb3 \ \cb1 there is an ebb and flow of impressions and sensations that your lower self\cb3 \ \cb1 transmits to you in flashes remember\cb3 \ \cb1 there you sit a float in a timeless sense of being you\cb3 \ \cb1 are light made of light and encased in light\cb3 \ \cb1 emitting light\cb3 \ \cb1 from that perspective you see but do not judge the actions of your lower self\cb3 \ \cb1 you see it scrambled back and forth like a toddler just learning to walk like a\cb3 \ \cb1 child it makes mistakes as it was born to do but how else can it learn\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] this is part and parcel of who and what it is that one that sits a liar's in\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation is calling out to you but may feel lost alone adrift or in need of\cb3 \ \cb1 guidance may feel disconnected confused\cb3 \ \cb1 and grounded\cb3 \ \cb1 it reaches for you as a toddler reaches out to its mother\cb3 \ \cb1 just listening now it asks for guidance\cb3 \ \cb1 reach out simply reach out and reminder that it is\cb3 \ \cb1 loved it has always been loved and will\cb3 \ \cb1 always be loved [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 with each in-breath that draws the memory of you deeper into itself\cb3 \ \cb1 with each out breath it stretches forth and reaches out to you\cb3 \ \cb1 here in this moment [Music] let the barriers of memory weaken so\cb3 \ \cb1 that the body sitting below you can feel you again feel its gentle rhythmic\cb3 \ \cb1 in-breath and out-breath expand and contract its wondrous body\cb3 \ \cb1 drawing you in with each inhalation and reaching out to you with each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 guide it that it may live in wisdom and power so that it may make the right\cb3 \ \cb1 choices at the right time in the right place\cb3 \ \cb1 and with the right people\cb3 \ \cb1 guide it but it may live in dignity and grace making the right choices at the\cb3 \ \cb1 right time at the right place\cb3 \ \cb1 with the right people\cb3 \ \cb1 guide it that it may live in peace and joy\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] guided that it may speak to you and hear you whenever the need arises always at\cb3 \ \cb1 the right time at the right place and with the right people [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 through your guidance may had finally learn to see the world\cb3 \ \cb1 in a grain of sand and heaven in everyone and everything\cb3 \ \cb1 even itself [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 through your guidance made finally learn the power of seeing infinity in its own\cb3 \ \cb1 existence and eternity in the joy of every breath and every passing moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] bring your focus back to the top of your head be all that light of your own power\cb3 \ \cb1 above you and know that it will always be there whenever you need its guidance\cb3 \ \cb1 simply be still and breathe slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 rhythmically [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale now and as you exhale mentally say to\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself I know [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and again inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 and on the exhale say I know [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and stay with this for a few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 return your focus to the spot between your eyebrows gently lower your eyes so\cb3 \

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 greetings my friends my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation guardians of the rainforest where you will journey deep into the\cb3 \ \cb1 lush rainforests and your questions will be answered allowing you to drift into a\cb3 \ \cb1 deep and restful sleep [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 just making sure that you are comfortable now completely comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 lying on your back with your arms by your side\cb3 \ \cb1 wriggling around until you get comfortable gently closing your eyes and\cb3 \ \cb1 using this initial time to take in a number of deep breaths sending that\cb3 \ \cb1 breath all the way down to your belly area breathing in through your nose and\cb3 \ \cb1 out through your mouth\cb3 \ \cb1 as you're breathing in be comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 where you are and knowing that you're in the right place at the right time for\cb3 \ \cb1 this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and returning your breath to a natural comfortable rhythm in and out through\cb3 \ \cb1 your nose as you do this becoming aware\cb3 \ \cb1 of the sensations of the breath as it goes into your belly\cb3 \ \cb1 we feel it expand doesn't leaves your belly you feel your\cb3 \ \cb1 belly just go down slightly this is not a forced breath or forced\cb3 \ \cb1 movement rather it's just a reaction a natural reaction to the breath going in\cb3 \ \cb1 and out moment by moment breath by\cb3 \ \cb1 breath [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I'd like you to become aware now of your entire body where your body meets the\cb3 \ \cb1 bed where your heels are resting your\cb3 \ \cb1 arms and your hands lying by your side and feeling the weight of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling the sensations of the sheets or blankets against your body or the pillow\cb3 \ \cb1 supporting your head [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and what I'd like you to do in these next few moments is to allow a body scan\cb3 \ \cb1 from the top of your head right down slowly to the tips of your toes and as\cb3 \ \cb1 you scan your body you're going to go along and witness any\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations that might be happening within various parts of your body now\cb3 \ \cb1 this may be physical sensations or it may be even stored emotions\cb3 \ \cb1 it's not about changing anything it's just about being present with your body\cb3 \ \cb1 your physical sensations and your emotions so scanning now from the top of\cb3 \ \cb1 your head right down to the tip of your toes and take a few minutes to do this\cb3 \ \cb1 and I will return\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I'd like you to visualize yourself now entering a lush green rain forest a\cb3 \ \cb1 place that seems almost magical hundreds\cb3 \ \cb1 of thousands of years old trees and foliage and a river that meanders to the\cb3 \ \cb1 right side of you\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin to go down to this river and walk alongside it as you do paying\cb3 \ \cb1 attention to the sounds of this river the healing sensations that it delivers\cb3 \ \cb1 to you\cb3 \ \cb1 you are at peace here there's no one\cb3 \ \cb1 else to disturb you only you and nature\cb3 \ \cb1 each time a thought comes up for you allow that thought to float by and you\cb3 \ \cb1 might like to project that thought into the river and allow that thought to\cb3 \ \cb1 trickle downstream actually see that the\cb3 \ \cb1 thought beginning to be placed into the river and beginning to leave you watch\cb3 \ \cb1 it as it goes the tune comes to your\cb3 \ \cb1 mind row row row your boat gently down\cb3 \ \cb1 the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream\cb3 \ \cb1 the river and all the stones within the river are here today to have lessons to\cb3 \ \cb1 teach you gentle lessons reminders\cb3 \ \cb1 because you already know inherently what it is here to teach you as you continue\cb3 \ \cb1 to walk up a slanted hill the gentle rivers still rolling along beside you\cb3 \ \cb1 you hear it whisper to you you already have everything you need it says you\cb3 \ \cb1 already have everything you need this reminder circulates throughout you at\cb3 \ \cb1 times you might be striving wanting reaching desiring something else to come\cb3 \ \cb1 in your life the river is here to tell\cb3 \ \cb1 you that you are already connected to everything that is and whatever you need\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever you desire is really only a thought away from your reality it all\cb3 \ \cb1 begins with a thought you are the co-creator of your life it's\cb3 \ \cb1 almost like you can let go of the striving this is not by any means being\cb3 \ \cb1 lazy rather it's simply surrendering to the process and trusting that your\cb3 \ \cb1 gentle actions are already in place manifesting your desires take a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 now to visualize the river and put your hands in allow the waters to splash to\cb3 \ \cb1 your face be grateful for this river and for all\cb3 \ \cb1 you have within your life at this time you might want to say a silent thank you\cb3 \ \cb1 as you continue on to move upwards\cb3 \ \cb1 the Sun peers through the top of the canopy of the rain forest creating\cb3 \ \cb1 almost a halo effect around you warming you soothing you you can almost feel the\cb3 \ \cb1 vibration of the cells within your body as they come alive from this beautiful\cb3 \ \cb1 sunlight you stand still in this place\cb3 \ \cb1 and allow the sun's rays to sink into your mind your body and spirit\cb3 \ \cb1 and so you continue\cb3 \ \cb1 the gentle sounds of the river following you as you continue on your path\cb3 \ \cb1 you take some time now to sit at the riverbank and allow your feet to soak\cb3 \ \cb1 within the cool water enjoy the coolness\cb3 \ \cb1 of the water as it flows between your toes around your feet and feeling the\cb3 \ \cb1 gravelly earth within the riverbed itself\cb3 \ \cb1 soothing your feet you might even want to rub them with in this gravelly earth\cb3 \ \cb1 almost like a massage for your feet\cb3 \ \cb1 as you look upstream you begin to see a bottle floating down with a note inside\cb3 \ \cb1 it as it comes closer to you you catch\cb3 \ \cb1 the bottle and you pour the cork out and read the note as you open up the note\cb3 \ \cb1 take a look at what it says you read the note the words materialize\cb3 \ \cb1 almost out of thin air they say you are loved for the uniqueness of who you are\cb3 \ \cb1 go out there and shine and let it be known to the world\cb3 \ \cb1 here is another reminder to you that something you inherently already know\cb3 \ \cb1 and yet sometimes you dismiss this you\cb3 \ \cb1 don't feel worthy you don't feel that you were good enough well this note is\cb3 \ \cb1 here to tell you that right now you are loved you are worthy and you are perfect\cb3 \ \cb1 in this very moment and it's calling out\cb3 \ \cb1 for you to truly recognize this and to acknowledge this to feel this with all\cb3 \ \cb1 your entire being and once you acknowledge this you give a mission for\cb3 \ \cb1 others to light up their lives too for others to recognize the love within\cb3 \ \cb1 themselves just take a few moments to sit with this\cb3 \ \cb1 to sit with this love within you you might begin to feel it radiating from\cb3 \ \cb1 the inside out allowing your body to\cb3 \ \cb1 grow lighter and shine brighter with every breath in and out\cb3 \ \cb1 you take this note and you place it back into the bottle and put the cork back on\cb3 \ \cb1 throwing it back into the river and allowing someone else downstream to\cb3 \ \cb1 receive the same message you begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 get up and continue on your journey\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you continue on a little squirrel runs past you he stops looks at you you\cb3 \ \cb1 look at him and even if only for a few moments you connect with him your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 meet the squirrel looks peaceful in this\cb3 \ \cb1 environment content and he's here to\cb3 \ \cb1 simply remind you that in this moment you're content that you can allow\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts of yesterday and worries or concerns of tomorrow to let go because\cb3 \ \cb1 these are not your reality your reality is only in this present moment this is\cb3 \ \cb1 your reality right here in this forest now this is your reality you feel this\cb3 \ \cb1 wonderful connection with this squirrel and he scampers away\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue on climbing inclines and\cb3 \ \cb1 steeper Hills the river still below you babbling away\cb3 \ \cb1 as you reach the top of the hill you see an enormous pine tree with a wooden rope\cb3 \ \cb1 ladder and you begin to climb this tree you are safe you feel safe up and up you\cb3 \ \cb1 go [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 beginning to be far above the river and this tree continues on even past the top\cb3 \ \cb1 of the canopy so right now you are up\cb3 \ \cb1 the top of this tree you see a hammock swinging from branch to branch just the\cb3 \ \cb1 perfect size for you and decide to spend some time swinging laying down with in\cb3 \ \cb1 this hammock right above the beautiful lush rainforest you're comforted here\cb3 \ \cb1 and supported and of course safe just enjoy lying here whilst the Sun\cb3 \ \cb1 envelops you soothes you and comfort you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 feel the Sun penetrating right deep down into every cell of your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 energizing you healing you on a deep sea\cb3 \ \cb1 level relaxing you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] just as you are enjoying this sunlight\cb3 \ \cb1 this gentle swinging of the hammock from high above the forest and the river a\cb3 \ \cb1 gentle tapping is on your right shoulder and as you open your eyes you see a baby\cb3 \ \cb1 chimpanzee he looks in your eyes with a joyous smile he just gently pat your\cb3 \ \cb1 head for a moment and it's like he's communicating directly to you with no\cb3 \ \cb1 word spoken reminding you of your child within and the joyous times you've had\cb3 \ \cb1 as a child think of how simple it was no\cb3 \ \cb1 concerns no worries no problems just happy within that moment at one\cb3 \ \cb1 particular moment see if you can recall a particular moment as a child when you\cb3 \ \cb1 were happy recall what it felt like see\cb3 \ \cb1 if you can pinpoint where that joy sprung from that excitement and he's\cb3 \ \cb1 here to remind you that this joy this inner child this happiness is always\cb3 \ \cb1 within you and you may sometimes need to take a little more time out to connect\cb3 \ \cb1 with this joy to do what pleases you to\cb3 \ \cb1 do what makes you smile and to look after that little girl or boy that is\cb3 \ \cb1 within you and has always been within you\cb3 \ \cb1 do what makes this little child feel happy and you can carry this back into\cb3 \ \cb1 your waking life the chimpanzee looks at\cb3 \ \cb1 you with a mischievous grin and he bounds away swinging from one vine to\cb3 \ \cb1 the next calling out as he goes you\cb3 \ \cb1 decide to have one last look around at the top of this canopy before you begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to climb back down the wooden rope ladder as you go down thanking the\cb3 \ \cb1 mischievous monkey breeze lessons on your inner child\cb3 \ \cb1 you finally reach the floor of the forest and continue now on your journey\cb3 \ \cb1 beginning to go downhill again getting closer and closer to the riverbank\cb3 \ \cb1 as you continue downwards towards the river you see an old man sitting in the\cb3 \ \cb1 seat it's a carved out wooden log the seat\cb3 \ \cb1 that has probably been here for centuries\cb3 \ \cb1 he's a frail old man and he turns to see you he motioned you to come and sit with\cb3 \ \cb1 him and he has a glint of joy within his eyes he says to you just for this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 be still no thoughts needed just be\cb3 \ \cb1 still and enjoy the sounds of the beautiful rainforest around you and so\cb3 \ \cb1 you sit with him and begin to listen and\cb3 \ \cb1 it's like the sounds of the rainforest a magnified a symphony of nature to your\cb3 \ \cb1 ears just enjoy these next few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 [Applause]\cb3 \ \cb1 you turn to look at the frail old man and he reminds you never be afraid to\cb3 \ \cb1 take time out to do nothing because in\cb3 \ \cb1 that nothingness there is everything that you need contained there you acknowledge this and\cb3 \ \cb1 you say goodbye to the old man and you continue on your journey\cb3 \ \cb1 as you continue on the meandering path alongside the river the sounds of water\cb3 \ \cb1 gushing begin to get louder and louder it seems like there is a large waterfall\cb3 \ \cb1 ahead excitedly you continue to move\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the sound\cb3 \ \cb1 the sound gets louder and begins to wash all over you reverberating through your\cb3 \ \cb1 entire body as you turn a corner a giant\cb3 \ \cb1 waterfall is seen\cb3 \ \cb1 a large cavern behind the 100-foot waterfall water cascading way above your\cb3 \ \cb1 head it's just you here you and the waterfall\cb3 \ \cb1 and nature\cb3 \ \cb1 you edged yourself close to the waterfall and put your arm underneath it\cb3 \ \cb1 you can feel the heaviness of the water as a pounds against your arms and hands\cb3 \ \cb1 it's cool but not too cold you see a\cb3 \ \cb1 little trail that leads behind the cavern of this giant waterfall and you\cb3 \ \cb1 decide to go under this and from here\cb3 \ \cb1 you can see the water pounding right in front of you splashing down to the rocks\cb3 \ \cb1 and the river below\cb3 \ \cb1 this waterfall is here to remind you of the strength you have within any\cb3 \ \cb1 obstacles that come forth in your life but you have this power within to\cb3 \ \cb1 overcome them to see them through no matter how dark these times may be this\cb3 \ \cb1 strength this inner strength can overcome almost any obstacle set before\cb3 \ \cb1 you and if there is an obstacle that can't be moved just like the waterfall it just travels\cb3 \ \cb1 around it and moves onwards not stopping not fearing just continuing to move with\cb3 \ \cb1 the flow of life you are how you are\cb3 \ \cb1 strength just be with this for a moment and allow the water to fall reminding\cb3 \ \cb1 you of all the strength you have all your ever need is right within you right\cb3 \ \cb1 at this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 you head on now back out from under the cabin back in the direction where you\cb3 \ \cb1 came you thank the waterfowl for the\cb3 \ \cb1 reminder as you begin to follow the river back downstream going with the\cb3 \ \cb1 flow of life\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue on with in the forest with\cb3 \ \cb1 the flow of the river passing the old man once more still seated on the carved\cb3 \ \cb1 out wooden chair you acknowledge each other and move on you pass the wooden rope\cb3 \ \cb1 ladder again a chimpanzee the squirrel\cb3 \ \cb1 and just as you begin to get closer to the edge of the forest a Sun shower begins to fall gently down\cb3 \ \cb1 rather than running from this you rejoice in this and look upwards and see\cb3 \ \cb1 this water gently coming down and refreshing you reminding you to\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender to life but whatever comes up for you to not try and force things\cb3 \ \cb1 aside to not try and push motions down\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] but rather to acknowledge everything\cb3 \ \cb1 that happens and surrender to it allow\cb3 \ \cb1 it to be and this makes your job in life so much easier\cb3 \ \cb1 so much more comfortable and joyous\cb3 \ \cb1 it's almost like you can use life as your playground you don't have to\cb3 \ \cb1 tighten your grip on anything it just be enjoy whatever happens at any point in\cb3 \ \cb1 given time allow it to be and in\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing it to be as it is it gives you so much power and strength you're\cb3 \ \cb1 acknowledging this present moment you\cb3 \ \cb1 won't have to get lost in the past or in the future within your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 these can be waste of time and this is all you have right here and\cb3 \ \cb1 now so just stand here and allow this\cb3 \ \cb1 gentle Sun shower to wash away old thoughts or remaining concern and be\cb3 \ \cb1 truly present\cb3 \ \cb1 coming back now you're leaving the forest as you do take one more moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 glance back and to thank the forest for all it has offered you today but every\cb3 \ \cb1 reminder that it has given you right now\cb3 \ \cb1 you're returning to your body where you can continue on begin to sleep and with\cb3 \ \cb1 the knowing that right now there is nothing else that needs to be done you\cb3 \ \cb1 can sleep be present and allow yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 to enjoy these moments and anything that needs to be done trust

\f0\fs22 \cf2 Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello my name is jason stevenson\cb3 \ \cb1 and welcome to this short guided\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 that will facilitate your release of any\cb3 \ \cb1 negative\cb3 \ \cb1 or limiting thoughts that no longer\cb3 \ \cb1 serve you\cb3 \ \cb1 it's time to let go of whatever has been\cb3 \ \cb1 holding you back\cb3 \ \cb1 to begin this transformative practice\cb3 \ \cb1 bring yourself to a comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 seated position either on the floor on a\cb3 \ \cb1 bench or in a chair\cb3 \ \cb1 and wherever you find yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 straightening your spine\cb3 \ \cb1 and let your heart space open up ever so\cb3 \ \cb1 gently and allow your shoulders to drop\cb3 \ \cb1 closing your eyes when you're ready\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let's take a few moments now to settle\cb3 \ \cb1 in by drawing our attention to the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and simply observe any sensations\cb3 \ \cb1 associated with each\cb3 \ \cb1 inward and each outward\cb3 \ \cb1 movement\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you might notice the temperature of the\cb3 \ \cb1 air as it enters your nostrils\cb3 \ \cb1 the feeling of the belly expanding and\cb3 \ \cb1 softening\cb3 \ \cb1 or a general sense of relaxation moving\cb3 \ \cb1 through your body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and now with each breath that enters\cb3 \ \cb1 your lungs\cb3 \ \cb1 i invite you to envision revitalized\cb3 \ \cb1 energy mingling with your cellular body\cb3 \ \cb1 and with each breath that departs\cb3 \ \cb1 imagine any unsupportive energy\cb3 \ \cb1 being released\cb3 \ \cb1 so breathing in fresh energy full of\cb3 \ \cb1 renewed\cb3 \ \cb1 vitality\cb3 \ \cb1 and breathe out whatever is calling to\cb3 \ \cb1 be\cb3 \ \cb1 surrendered\cb3 \ \cb1 now i invite you to enter into a visual\cb3 \ \cb1 journey\cb3 \ \cb1 of transformation by imagining that you\cb3 \ \cb1 are standing\cb3 \ \cb1 at the foot of a wooded mountain\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath you your feet root into the rich\cb3 \ \cb1 soil\cb3 \ \cb1 footpath\cb3 \ \cb1 and all around evergreen trees stretch\cb3 \ \cb1 up towards the cosmos\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 your nose picks up the scent of the pine\cb3 \ \cb1 infused aroma of these woods\cb3 \ \cb1 cleansing you from within with each\cb3 \ \cb1 full breath you take\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and before you the footpath weaves its\cb3 \ \cb1 way through the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 up towards the mountain's peak\cb3 \ \cb1 eager to begin this journey of\cb3 \ \cb1 transformation and release\cb3 \ \cb1 you take your first few steps\cb3 \ \cb1 in the direction of the summit above\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you walk you feel life's vital energy\cb3 \ \cb1 flowing through you your body is engaged\cb3 \ \cb1 your mind is focused and your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 begins to deepen\cb3 \ \cb1 along your journey through the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 that blankets the slope of the mountain\cb3 \ \cb1 you admire the qualities you observe in\cb3 \ \cb1 this natural landscape\cb3 \ \cb1 the resilience the strength\cb3 \ \cb1 the adaptability and the beauty\cb3 \ \cb1 of the wildlife that is abundant here\cb3 \ \cb1 as you admire these qualities in the\cb3 \ \cb1 world outside of you\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin to realize that they reflect\cb3 \ \cb1 what is innately\cb3 \ \cb1 present within you too\cb3 \ \cb1 as you continue to hike towards the peak\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel this truth permeating more\cb3 \ \cb1 deeply\cb3 \ \cb1 with hours passing that feel as though\cb3 \ \cb1 they were sheer\cb3 \ \cb1 minutes the land beneath you begins to\cb3 \ \cb1 level out\cb3 \ \cb1 as the earth plateaus you make your way\cb3 \ \cb1 through the final\cb3 \ \cb1 stretch of trees before emerging onto\cb3 \ \cb1 the flat rock\cb3 \ \cb1 of this majestic mountain's peak\cb3 \ \cb1 you breathe in and release a deep sigh\cb3 \ \cb1 your jaw drops and your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 widens to the beauty of the world that\cb3 \ \cb1 extends around you\cb3 \ \cb1 valleys rivers lakes and forests\cb3 \ \cb1 down below reach out in all directions\cb3 \ \cb1 you are witnessing the world from this\cb3 \ \cb1 heightened perspective\cb3 \ \cb1 as if for the very first time\cb3 \ \cb1 and as the gentle breeze rushes against\cb3 \ \cb1 your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 you remember your intention for coming\cb3 \ \cb1 here\cb3 \ \cb1 to release what no longer serves you and\cb3 \ \cb1 to welcome the winds of change that will\cb3 \ \cb1 propel you forward\cb3 \ \cb1 and so here standing upon the\cb3 \ \cb1 mountaintop\cb3 \ \cb1 you let come to mind any\cb3 \ \cb1 and all of the negative thoughts that no\cb3 \ \cb1 longer serve you\cb3 \ \cb1 when they arise they do not stay with\cb3 \ \cb1 you for long as you surrender them\cb3 \ \cb1 up to the wind that dances through the\cb3 \ \cb1 atmosphere\cb3 \ \cb1 all around you\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender with the breath exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 by exhalation each\cb3 \ \cb1 thought each feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 and every negative knot of energy that\cb3 \ \cb1 holds you back\cb3 \ \cb1 from realizing your true potential\cb3 \ \cb1 let the wind carry them away from you\cb3 \ \cb1 leaving you vibrantly alive\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the muscles around your eyes to\cb3 \ \cb1 relax now\cb3 \ \cb1 and your attention to land in the center\cb3 \ \cb1 of your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you gaze out upon the wonder of\cb3 \ \cb1 the world above\cb3 \ \cb1 below and all around you\cb3 \ \cb1 silently set an intention to nourish\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 with positive thoughts in the minutes\cb3 \ \cb1 hours and days to come\cb3 \ \cb1 take one more long deep breath in here\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you release let go of any\cb3 \ \cb1 residual\cb3 \ \cb1 negative energy with a deep sigh\cb3 \ \cb1 let it out\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly now let the imagery of this\cb3 \ \cb1 landscape\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to fade from your mind's eye as\cb3 \ \cb1 you come back\cb3 \ \cb1 to the natural rhythm of your breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 tune into your body into the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 supporting you from below\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you are ready you can gently\cb3 \ \cb1 let the light\cb3 \ \cb1 seep back into your eyes as they slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 open\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you move through the day ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 let yourself be empowered by the\cb3 \ \cb1 transformation and release\cb3 \ \cb1 that you've experienced in this practice\cb3 \ \cb1 today\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the winds of inspired change\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to awaken and guide you\cb3 \ \cb1 many blessings\cb3 \ \cb1 you}

you are safe and\cb3 \ \cb1 supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you\cb3 \ \cb1 choose to do so\cb3 \ \cb1 as we begin allow your eyes to close gently\cb3 \ \cb1 and focus your attention on your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 imagine the air you are breathing in as a warm glowing light that fills you\cb3 \ \cb1 up and heals you from the inside hold\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath for just a moment allowing this light to go deep down into your\cb3 \ \cb1 belly and then let out that breath\cb3 \ \cb1 gently allowing any physical and emotional attention to leave your body\cb3 \ \cb1 with your exhale again take another deep breath hold it\cb3 \ \cb1 for a short moment and this time\cb3 \ \cb1 take your time with the exhale slowing it down\cb3 \ \cb1 take the next few moments to

relax that body part completely\cb3 \ \cb1 let's begin this relaxation process with the scalp\cb3 \ \cb1 welcoming ease into the forehead and eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the release of any facial expression to soften the lines of your\cb3 \ \cb1 face relax the tiny muscles around your\cb3 \ \cb1 eyes and feel as your eyelids become heavy\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your cheeks to soften your jaw to unclench and your neck to relax\cb3 \ \cb1 completely\cb3 \ \cb1 as each muscle relaxants in progression it invites a deeper sense of relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 to the parts of your body that came before in our body

\cb1 your body is safe and supported and knows exactly what to do to relax if\cb3 \ \cb1 you simply allow the tension to release\cb3 \ \cb1 now they were fully relaxed I will guide you on a journey this journey will take\cb3 \ \cb1 you on a path to release any negative beliefs or ideas that could be holding\cb3 \ \cb1 you back from the abundance you desire\cb3 \ \cb1 then you will bring in the energy of abundance into the space you create for\cb3 \ \cb1 it when you let go of fears\cb3 \ \cb1 I invite you to open your imagination and step into a field of beautiful\cb3 \ \cb1 wildflowers\cb3 \ \cb1 look around at this field of wildflowers as you stand on a path that leads you\cb3 \ \cb1 right down the center of the field here you are surrounded on both sides\cb3 \ \cb1 by flowers and the

peaceful in this place in your imagination that\cb3 \ \cb1 is just right for you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you begin to walk along this path down\cb3 \ \cb1 the center of the field moving towards some rolling hills where you see even\cb3 \ \cb1 more wildflowers\cb3 \ \cb1 as you walk you have a feeling that you are carrying around something extra\cb3 \ \cb1 something weighing you down something making you feel heavy and tired\cb3 \ \cb1 you reach into your pockets and feel that surprisingly there are some smooth\cb3 \ \cb1 stones there\cb3 \ \cb1 these stones that you are carrying around weighing you down [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 represent your fears and your feelings of not enough\cb3 \ \cb1 they represent anything known or unknown to you that is holding you back\cb3 \ \cb1 each stone is something that is blocking the flow of abundance to you\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly take one stone out of your pocket and leave it on the path behind you as\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue walking forwards\cb3 \ \cb1 feel that a space has opened up inside of you as you let go of something\cb3 \ \cb1 negative in your life\cb3 \ \cb1 there's no need to label what you are letting go of simply let go knowing that\cb3 \ \cb1 it's something that no longer serves you or support your goals and desires for\cb3 \ \cb1 abundance\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to do the same with each of the remaining stones in your pocket one at a\cb3 \ \cb1 time take your time and feel the\cb3 \ \cb1 energetic shift from negative to positive\cb3 \ \cb1 feel the space you have opened up for the flow of abundance\cb3 \ \cb1 now that you have

\f0\fs22 \cf2 welcome this guided meditation is to help you sue the feelings of anxiety\cb3 \ \cb1 before bed so that you can fall asleep easily and have a peaceful night's sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation before bed is a wonderful way to quiet the racing thoughts and to get ready for the day or week ahead\cb3 \ \cb1 please do not use this as a substitute for seeking the advice of a medical professional if necessary the mind is a\cb3 \ \cb1 complex process sometimes we find ourselves overwhelmed by where our mind\cb3 \ \cb1 can take us ideally as we become more self-aware through our practice we learn\cb3 \ \cb1 how to use our mind as a tool many of us have difficulty with this concept or\cb3 \ \cb1 have not yet begun that path when our mind uses us instead it can lead us in\cb3 \ \cb1 various directions when this happens we are subject to the reactions we may have\cb3 \ \cb1 to our thoughts and our life situations\cb3 \ \cb1 this is often what triggers feelings of anxiety when our mind takes us to future\cb3 \ \cb1 moments we can feel worried or even panic over what's to come\cb3 \ \cb1 anxiety is on some level living in the future nothing ever happens in the\cb3 \ \cb1 future though everything happens in the present moment getting in touch with the\cb3 \ \cb1 present moment and the timeless beauty of the now and accepting it fully with love and non judgment that is where the\cb3 \ \cb1 answer to anxiety lies many people deal\cb3 \ \cb1 with feelings of anxiety on a regular basis understanding some of the details on a basic level can help set your path\cb3 \ \cb1 towards an anxiety free life first of all anxiety cannot hurt you even though\cb3 \ \cb1 it might feel otherwise in the moment it is important to recognize this it is\cb3 \ \cb1 basically a shift in activity in the brain from one area to another it may\cb3 \ \cb1 create physical symptoms that appear at times quite severe it can even replicate\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling similar to a real physical concern being able to recognize these feelings\cb3 \ \cb1 for what they are just a temporary shift towards the sympathetic nervous system also known as the fight-or-flight\cb3 \ \cb1 response is a powerful step towards healing\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] once we understand and truly believe\cb3 \ \cb1 that these feelings no matter how powerful can do us no harm we can accept\cb3 \ \cb1 them without judgment in fact as an observer of our bodies we want to\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome these feelings oftentimes it's the fear of anxiety that triggers\cb3 \ \cb1 further anxious sensations if we truly do not fear them they will begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 dissolve welcome them as The Watcher of your body as if you are expecting these\cb3 \ \cb1 feelings see these feelings as a teaching tool as though you are\cb3 \ \cb1 completely okay with them smile at them smile with every cell in your body and\cb3 \ \cb1 as your love shines its light the darkness will fade\cb3 \ \cb1 oftentimes this anxiety creeps up around bedtime when we begin to consider what's\cb3 \ \cb1 in store for the next day or the week ahead it is the idea of living in the\cb3 \ \cb1 future today I will invite you into your\cb3 \ \cb1 present moment to let go of the past and\cb3 \ \cb1 have confidence in what the future holds I will guide you to attend to your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath and your physical sensations in this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 with this practice you can peacefully drift off to sleep take a moment and\cb3 \ \cb1 make sure you are in a safe place to drift off to sleep if you choose if you\cb3 \ \cb1 need to pause this video that's okay [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 make sure your room is dark and you are very comfortable if you are listening to\cb3 \ \cb1 this on an electronic device turn the screens light away from you create the\cb3 \ \cb1 most comfortable environment that you can\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] once you are ready to begin the journey to sleep bring your attention to your\cb3 \ \cb1 breath and invite the feeling of\cb3 \ \cb1 settling into your space knowing you are exactly where you need to be\cb3 \ \cb1 I'm going to count to three and then I would like you to take a deep breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 through your nose and as you exhale gently close your eyes and soften your\cb3 \ \cb1 body one two three\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let's repeat that cycle two more times gently open your eyes one two three\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in deeply and relax on your exhale letting your eyes close one more\cb3 \ \cb1 time softly open your eyes one two three\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in deep and relax letting your\cb3 \ \cb1 eyes shut down and your whole body relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 and with your eyes closed now allow your breath to become natural\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] knowing that the body knows what to do\cb3 \ \cb1 to breathe to relax and to recover and\cb3 \ \cb1 rejuvenate while you sleep and now\cb3 \ \cb1 simply be aware of the sensations in your body that are associated with the\cb3 \ \cb1 natural rhythm of your breath [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the cool air of the passes into your nostrils and how the air is a\cb3 \ \cb1 little warmer as it flows out of your body feel as the chest and belly rise\cb3 \ \cb1 and fall and rhythm with the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as you continue breathing naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to sense the pause that occurs between the exhale and the next inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 keep your attention on this momentary pause for the next few breaths using\cb3 \ \cb1 this pause to come back to each present moment use this pause to let go of the\cb3 \ \cb1 worry about the future to let go of the need for perfection to let go of the\cb3 \ \cb1 shoulds [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if your attention drifts away from your breath which it likely will noticing a\cb3 \ \cb1 sound or a thought or a physical sensation lovingly return your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 to the next breath and the next pause\cb3 \ \cb1 continue focusing on your breath as you invite your body to soften and reacts\cb3 \ \cb1 each natural exhale takes you deeper into relaxation and closer to peaceful\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep allow yourself to let go of all\cb3 \ \cb1 the stress from your day\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of your to-do list for the future\cb3 \ \cb1 and now gently move your attention to your body first focus your attention on\cb3 \ \cb1 your face as you exhale let go of all\cb3 \ \cb1 the muscles of your face\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] relax your forehead relax the tiny\cb3 \ \cb1 muscles around your eyes and your cheeks\cb3 \ \cb1 unclench your jaw and think into the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface below you\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to watch your breath as you let go of the muscles in your neck and your\cb3 \ \cb1 shoulders [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 relax your arms relax your back\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] let go of all of the muscles in your\cb3 \ \cb1 belly and your hips\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of any tension in your legs\cb3 \ \cb1 invite the sensation of relaxation to let everything go\cb3 \ \cb1 you are now very relaxed you are feeling\cb3 \ \cb1 very comfortable and you are enjoying a sense of inner peace that is soothing\cb3 \ \cb1 and quieting your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly complete one more scan of your body sensations from your head all the\cb3 \ \cb1 way down throughout your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you do breathe deeply into any\cb3 \ \cb1 areas of remaining tension to completely let go\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] inviting your body to go deeper into\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 you now I would like you to imagine watching\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself as an observer outside of your own body\cb3 \ \cb1 imagine yourself in a place where you have known to have the sense of anxiety\cb3 \ \cb1 in the past\cb3 \ \cb1 maybe it's at work or at home or possibly in a social situation\cb3 \ \cb1 I would like you to see yourself going through your day when you begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 notice these unwanted feelings coming on as the observer notice that you are not\cb3 \ \cb1 these feelings one moment you can see yourself happy and content then you can\cb3 \ \cb1 see yourself noticing these sensations bubbling up from inside it's okay these\cb3 \ \cb1 anxious feelings are there but everything is okay continue to watch\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself and

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will take you on a\cb3 \ \cb1 journey to your inner child as you encounter the child within you'll be\cb3 \ \cb1 guided into developing a more loving freeing and forgiving relationship with\cb3 \ \cb1 this aspect of self then you may previously have had my name is Jason\cb3 \ \cb1 Stephenson and thank you for joining me tonight allow your heart to open to this\cb3 \ \cb1 transformative process as you develop perhaps a new or reimagined way of\cb3 \ \cb1 relating to that child within so to begin take your time to find a\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable resting position where you can settle in for the night ahead [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 ensure that your spine is as straight as possible they're still relaxed and allow your\cb3 \ \cb1 limbs to rest comfortably and naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 with your eyes closed take a few moments to reconnect with your breath simply\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the way it waxes and wanes through the body\cb3 \ \cb1 soften your brow [Music] you're turning your jaw\cb3 \ \cb1 and your belly as you settle deeper into the space that holds you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and see if you might allow the stomach to rise and fall to its fullest capacity\cb3 \ \cb1 with each breath with each in-breath the\cb3 \ \cb1 belly extends with ease and with each\cb3 \ \cb1 breath out it gently falls back down [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 extending with ease as it feels and\cb3 \ \cb1 falling gently as it empties\cb3 \ \cb1 now before we take a journey to meet the inner child\cb3 \ \cb1 let us ground ourselves in compassion patience and care each one of us has a\cb3 \ \cb1 unique relationship to our inner child and sometimes it is a challenging one\cb3 \ \cb1 for this reason it is important that we\cb3 \ \cb1 establish ourselves in love before moving further so take a moment now to\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your attention to the heart space watching as the breath flows into and\cb3 \ \cb1 out of this loving center of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 you might imagine that each inhalation feeds your inner capacity for love and\cb3 \ \cb1 that each breath out softens any resistance to self-love and care\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you breathe through the heart take a few moments to reaffirm the\cb3 \ \cb1 following sentiments that will support you on your journey I am patient and\cb3 \ \cb1 gentle with myself [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I care for and embrace my innermost self\cb3 \ \cb1 I support myself unconditionally\cb3 \ \cb1 I am grounded in love and compassion\cb3 \ \cb1 let these words dissipate into the background as you sink into this energy\cb3 \ \cb1 of loving-kindness continue to mind the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 remembering that each inhalation fuels you and that each exhalation frees you\cb3 \ \cb1 of what is no longer required\cb3 \ \cb1 and as we move through this journey know that your experience will be as unique\cb3 \ \cb1 as you and your inner child are for some this process might be difficult know\cb3 \ \cb1 that as you move through this you are always encouraged to follow your own\cb3 \ \cb1 inner guidance so be sure to do whatever you need to do to support yourself just\cb3 \ \cb1 allow my words to guide you and remember that you can always come back to the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath to ground you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 before we move into this visualization let's take three deep cleansing breaths\cb3 \ \cb1 together begin by letting your last\cb3 \ \cb1 inhalation leave the body completely and then take a deep full breath in for the\cb3 \ \cb1 count of four and then slowly exhale for\cb3 \ \cb1 a count of six another deep breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 for a slow count of four and when you've\cb3 \ \cb1 reached the top slowly exhale for a count of six one last breath in for four\cb3 \ \cb1 and let it back out for six\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and allowing your breath to come back to\cb3 \ \cb1 its natural rhythm as you sink into the surface beneath you use your breath as\cb3 \ \cb1 an anchor whenever you need it to tether you back into this present moment now\cb3 \ \cb1 let all unnecessary tension slowly begin to dissolve into the space that supports\cb3 \ \cb1 you allow yourself to be held here unconditionally to begin this visual\cb3 \ \cb1 journey turn your attention towards your mind's eye and imagine yourself standing\cb3 \ \cb1 in a deep lush evergreen forest your\cb3 \ \cb1 feet are firmly rooted in a pressed Earth pathway that weaves through the\cb3 \ \cb1 trees and all around you majestic aspen spruce and pine trees\cb3 \ \cb1 climb up into the clear blue sky [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 your spine is straight your chest is open and your shoulders are relaxed and\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe you do so deeply welcoming the cleansing pine infused air\cb3 \ \cb1 into the depths of your lungs\cb3 \ \cb1 you exhale with a soft sigh letting go of anything that does not serve you here\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take three full deep breaths at your own pace now letting the crisp and clean forest air\cb3 \ \cb1 cleanse mind body and soul\cb3 \ \cb1 you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and after your third deep breath you begin your journey ahead step-by-step\cb3 \ \cb1 you make your way through the enchanted forest that holds you the air is a\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable temperature keeping you both warm and refreshed\cb3 \ \cb1 observe the colors and textures that fill your eyesight as you pass through\cb3 \ \cb1 this landscape what shapes do the trees take\cb3 \ \cb1 what hues appear in the leaves the trunks of the trees and any other plant\cb3 \ \cb1 life that thrives here [Music] what richness and diversity is apparent\cb3 \ \cb1 to you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the further you venture the more settled you feel this flourishing ecosystem\cb3 \ \cb1 holds you as one of its own leading you gently onwards down your own path of\cb3 \ \cb1 healing\cb3 \ \cb1 it's not long before there is a break in the trees and you step out of the woods\cb3 \ \cb1 upon the site of a magnificent shimmering lake your shoulders drop even\cb3 \ \cb1 further from your ears as your soul is stirred by this body of water you\cb3 \ \cb1 approach the water's edge slowly inching your way towards the rocky shoreline\cb3 \ \cb1 that surrounds it the still water loves\cb3 \ \cb1 you right up to its edge and so you take a seat on the smooth rock face\cb3 \ \cb1 overlooking the water to rest for a while [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the Sun inches its way towards the treeline inviting a car and wrested\cb3 \ \cb1 energy to the fading day the wind is barely traceable and the flat water\cb3 \ \cb1 sparkles beneath the Setting Sun all is well as you gaze across the water\cb3 \ \cb1 you realize you feel deeply content in this space and time there is nothing\cb3 \ \cb1 missing from this moment and yet your heart is wide open to whatever might\cb3 \ \cb1 come your way you feel strong stable and\cb3 \ \cb1 secure in who and where you are\cb3 \ \cb1 remaining seated here something draws your attention down the shore that leads\cb3 \ \cb1 into the Setting Sun some distance away\cb3 \ \cb1 you notice someone making their way towards you it is a young person perhaps\cb3 \ \cb1 five or six years of age though their exact age is entirely up to you this\cb3 \ \cb1 individual slowly makes their way closer and closer to you until soon you realize\cb3 \ \cb1 that the person approaching is you it is\cb3 \ \cb1 you from some many years ago it is the child within the child that has always\cb3 \ \cb1 kept some space within you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 they're returning to you and you to them\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to fully notice this child let your heart be completely open to\cb3 \ \cb1 their presence regardless of how they've shown up today\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 this child moves carefully and as they come within a few meters distance you\cb3 \ \cb1 offer a few words of kindness and invite them to come and sit next to you\cb3 \ \cb1 knowing they're safe in this visualization they come to take a seat\cb3 \ \cb1 in front of you\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin this interaction simply by extending the warmth of your heart onto\cb3 \ \cb1 this small person before you grounded in\cb3 \ \cb1 a wisdom and self compassion that they have yet to develop you hold this energy\cb3 \ \cb1 for them simply through your presence you offer them your unconditional\cb3 \ \cb1 acceptance [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 meeting their eyes you take in the heart and soul of this child and you ask them\cb3 \ \cb1 if there is anything on their heart or mind [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 leave plenty of space for what arises and if or as they speak listen without\cb3 \ \cb1 judgment simply hold space but whatever\cb3 \ \cb1 it is they are feeling know also that it\cb3 \ \cb1 is okay if they do not have any words to say your inner child may speak through\cb3 \ \cb1 nonverbal language\cb3 \ \cb1 and in the face of whatever arises whether that be fear joy anger grief\cb3 \ \cb1 guilt playfulness or anything else you offer them your love you offer this\cb3 \ \cb1 child your compassion without expectation and without condition let\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself be there Rock as steady as the physical rock beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 nurture them in whatever way feels most comfortable for the two of you perhaps\cb3 \ \cb1 that is through a big hug or through hands held tightly or perhaps it is\cb3 \ \cb1 simply through holding the space for one another know that there is no right or\cb3 \ \cb1 wrong way to nurture your inner child here\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and then ask your inner child if there is something they'd like your help with\cb3 \ \cb1 is there something they'd like you to set free for them is there something\cb3 \ \cb1 they would like you to forgive\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let this child know that they have your unconditional support in releasing\cb3 \ \cb1 anything that does not serve their sense of happiness and wholeness you as their\cb3 \ \cb1 wise elder can offer them the love support and forgiveness that they've\cb3 \ \cb1 been yearning for\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and now\cb3 \ \cb1 in the silent space that holds you both next to the lake you might silently repeat to them I see\cb3 \ \cb1 you I hear you I love you\cb3 \ \cb1 I am here for you I support you\cb3 \ \cb1 I forgive you\cb3 \ \cb1 I honor you\cb3 \ \cb1 I embrace you\cb3 \ \cb1 I free you\cb3 \ \cb1 take some more time now to fully embrace this in a child through your loving\cb3 \ \cb1 presence through hands held or through a warm and caring hug let this child be\cb3 \ \cb1 held by your love and by your strength [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let this child take the time they need to feel as they feel reminding them that\cb3 \ \cb1 you are not here to change them you are simply here to listen and to support\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and as they feel heard the inner world\cb3 \ \cb1 begins to quiet as does your own\cb3 \ \cb1 soon the two of you sit peacefully and contently gazing out over the calm\cb3 \ \cb1 waters of the lake at dusk [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 The Sun has disappeared behind the trees and a warm orange glow stretches across\cb3 \ \cb1 the horizon the sky above is ocean blue\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly deepening its turn as the day fades away\cb3 \ \cb1 you and your inner child look towards one another and smile you were grateful\cb3 \ \cb1 for this moment and for this opportunity to reconnect\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you and as the colors of the sky signal that\cb3 \ \cb1 it is almost time for slumber you ask your inner child where they like to rest\cb3 \ \cb1 for the night perhaps they yearn to go to bed in a\cb3 \ \cb1 place from your shared past perhaps they\cb3 \ \cb1 longed to slumber beneath the open starry sky or perhaps they would find\cb3 \ \cb1 the most peace the most happiness falling asleep in some imagined land\cb3 \ \cb1 that inspires them wherever your inner\cb3 \ \cb1 child finds peace and comfort let them know you will guide them there\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and then slowly slowly letting the\cb3 \ \cb1 landscape in your mind transform call to mind the place where they know they will\cb3 \ \cb1 rest with the most ease [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 imagine what this place looks like and what comforts it holds\cb3 \ \cb1 wherever you find yourself invite your inner child to settle into a cozy and\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable bed for the night you tuck\cb3 \ \cb1 them in with love and care reminding them that you are always here for them\cb3 \ \cb1 and as they surrender into the night you whisper the words I love you I am here\cb3 \ \cb1 for you I love you I am here for you I\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] love you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] I am here for you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] spend a few more silent moments whispering these words to your inner\cb3 \ \cb1 child perhaps aligning the words I love you with your inhalations and I'm here\cb3 \ \cb1 for you with your exhalations\cb3 \ \cb1 the inner child drifts off to sleep and you are left with the revitalized sense\cb3 \ \cb1 of love and care for this part of yourself you set an intention now that\cb3 \ \cb1 when the signs of this inner child arise in you in the future you will tend to\cb3 \ \cb1 them with unconditional patience presence love and compassion\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now you two are ready to surrender into sleep and so you come back to your body\cb3 \ \cb1 letting the evenings visualizations gently begin to dissipate\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the felt sense of your body being supported by the bed or other surface\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath you what does it feel like to be\cb3 \ \cb1 held here [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the breath as it flows through you creating an expansion and a\cb3 \ \cb1 softening with each full cycle\cb3 \ \cb1 and then draw your attention to the heart space once again connecting with\cb3 \ \cb1 the center of your compassion for one last time before drifting into sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and as you hold your attention here\cb3 \ \cb1 imagine a small white light beginning to appear in the center of your chest it\cb3 \ \cb1 expands outwards with each second that goes by and as it permeates through your\cb3 \ \cb1 body it offers its a loving energy to each cell that it passes\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 soon your entire body is held in this healing white light arising from within\cb3 \ \cb1 it nurtures every part of you the present self the past self and the\cb3 \ \cb1 future self all at the same time\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] spend just a few more moments now\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling yourself as you were bathed in this warm glow\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you were ready slowly let that light dissipate\cb3 \ \cb1 come back to the felt sense of your body in this space let yourself connect\cb3 \ \cb1 intimately with the earth that supports you here and then let your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 come back to the breath noting this natural movement as it passes through\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 if there is anything else that needs to be released let it out now with a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 sigh [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your breath to be an anchor for your awareness as you slowly drift into\cb3 \ \cb1 slumber\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep well my friend sleep well\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will focus on inner\cb3 \ \cb1 clearing forgiveness and the Hawaiian prayer our pono pono my name is Jason\cb3 \ \cb1 Stevenson and I invite you to gently open your heart as you move with me\cb3 \ \cb1 through this deeply healing and restorative practice and closing your\cb3 \ \cb1 eyes if you've not done so then explore what it feels like to fully arrive here\cb3 \ \cb1 and to arrive in this sense means simply to let your mind join your body to set\cb3 \ \cb1 aside for the time being any notions about the past or the future you can\cb3 \ \cb1 help your mind to arrive here by tuning into the surface beneath your body or by\cb3 \ \cb1 holding your entire being in open awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 establishing this sense of presence will anchor you as you journey through this practice of clearing away any past\cb3 \ \cb1 mistakes wrongdoings and resentments because as we surrender into this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 it becomes more natural to surrender any inner workings that prevent us from\cb3 \ \cb1 living in the name of love patience forgiveness and understanding now let\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention land on the breaths flow if it's not already there and simply mind this natural movement of lifeforce\cb3 \ \cb1 as you ground into this practice for a few more moments a few more breaths\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let each inhalation create an inner expansion and each exhalation and inner\cb3 \ \cb1 softening\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the Hawaiian prayer our pono pono is a practice of healing and clearing through\cb3 \ \cb1 forgiveness translated this term can be understood to mean to make right or to\cb3 \ \cb1 correct some definitions even refer to it as a mental and emotional cleansing\cb3 \ \cb1 during this practice we will explore the power of forgiveness by first easing the\cb3 \ \cb1 physical body and then moving into a guided visualization for a deeper level\cb3 \ \cb1 of mental and emotional clearing we will\cb3 \ \cb1 finish this practice with a repeated ho'oponopono mantra as you gently\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender into a good night's sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 so I invite you now to take a moment to come back to the physical body simply\cb3 \ \cb1 noting what it is like to be in the present space that you occupy and as you\cb3 \ \cb1 are guided through the physical body I invite you to bring your loving awareness to each area that we pass as\cb3 \ \cb1 you inhale into each corner of the body bring a healing white light or a sense\cb3 \ \cb1 of love to that area and as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 let it soften into the present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 so beginning now at your toes holding them in your full awareness breathe\cb3 \ \cb1 loving energy into these parts of you sending the breath all the way down and\cb3 \ \cb1 then exhale to let any tension here dissipate\cb3 \ \cb1 and moving up now to your ankles breathing in deeply down into your\cb3 \ \cb1 ankles and releasing\cb3 \ \cb1 your calves and shins sending the breath down and releasing softening\cb3 \ \cb1 moving up to your knees breathing in\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing out your thighs and your\cb3 \ \cb1 hamstrings [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and shifting the focus to your pelvis and your hips breathing in and on the\cb3 \ \cb1 breath out softening your belly and your\cb3 \ \cb1 lower back\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and then moving up to your spy into your\cb3 \ \cb1 chest and your upper back [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now draw your attention to your fingertips breathing light or love into\cb3 \ \cb1 your entire hands and releasing on the\cb3 \ \cb1 out-breath\cb3 \ \cb1 continuing with your wrists\cb3 \ \cb1 your lower arms\cb3 \ \cb1 your elbows\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] moving up to your upper arms breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 in breathing out and release and your\cb3 \ \cb1 shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing in loving energy into your throat area and soften as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 continue with your jaw and your mouth\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 your cheeks ears and nose\cb3 \ \cb1 you your third eye area between your two\cb3 \ \cb1 eyebrows [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and then finish by breathing this way into the crown of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 hold your entire body in your awareness now for a few more grounding breaths\cb3 \ \cb1 before we move deeper into this process of clearing you might imagine that your\cb3 \ \cb1 entire body is being bathed in a white light one that frees you of any\cb3 \ \cb1 inhibiting physical tension\cb3 \ \cb1 and then gently let that white light dissipate in your own time\cb3 \ \cb1 now this will be a journey of clearing and forgiveness and while on the other\cb3 \ \cb1 side of these processes is deep peace and love the journey itself may be\cb3 \ \cb1 challenging for some depending upon how you find yourself in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 offering yourself or others forgiveness may cause difficult emotions to arise if\cb3 \ \cb1 this turns out to be the case for you tonight remember that you can always come back to your breath or your body to\cb3 \ \cb1 ground yourself let your heart journey as deep as it is\cb3 \ \cb1 meant to be in this moment knowing that you are universally supported\cb3 \ \cb1 so take a moment to find yourself standing outside of a home or cabin that\cb3 \ \cb1 feels safe comfortable and welcoming to you\cb3 \ \cb1 it might be a home that you know or one that the mind creates in either case\cb3 \ \cb1 observe what its exterior looks like what is it made of\cb3 \ \cb1 what is the surrounding environment like\cb3 \ \cb1 what about this abode that warms the heart and soul\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments to cultivate an image of this home in your mind letting it\cb3 \ \cb1 bring you a sense of safety and peace\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] this home has shown up view today to\cb3 \ \cb1 serve as a symbol for coming home to yourself it represents a return to the\cb3 \ \cb1 love support and care that is within you and so before you make your way inside\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to set an intention to love care for and support yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 unconditionally\cb3 \ \cb1 and now as you reach your hand for the door handle you slowly turn pull and\cb3 \ \cb1 make your way inside standing in the\cb3 \ \cb1 front hallway you feel an immense sense of relief and gratitude wash over you\cb3 \ \cb1 the home is exactly what you imagined it would be when you stood outside of it\cb3 \ \cb1 a sanctuary full of love light and beauty that also lives at the very core\cb3 \ \cb1 of your being\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to imagine what this hallway looks like what colors are its\cb3 \ \cb1 walls what details and accents does it\cb3 \ \cb1 boast what artwork adorns it\cb3 \ \cb1 now you slowly walk down the drifting main hallway soon arriving in a living\cb3 \ \cb1 space that is warm at ease and full of soul and charm it contains details both\cb3 \ \cb1 large and small that bring you a sense of coming home to yourself this room is\cb3 \ \cb1 a perfect reflection of who you are at your loving core take a few moments now\cb3 \ \cb1 to paint in your mind's eye [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the windows the light and the\cb3 \ \cb1 energy that this room holds\cb3 \ \cb1 imagine now that alongside one wall of this room is a mirror tall and wide it\cb3 \ \cb1 reflects back the entire room into the onlookers eyes depending upon what angle\cb3 \ \cb1 it is approached at something about this mirror is mesmerizing and then you\cb3 \ \cb1 notice that just in front of it cushions and blankets rest as if it's been\cb3 \ \cb1 waiting for you slowly and mindfully you\cb3 \ \cb1 make your way over to this little oasis within the soulful room you've designed\cb3 \ \cb1 taking a seat upon the blankets and cushions presented here you settle in\cb3 \ \cb1 straightening the spine as much as comfortable and letting the shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 your jaw softens as does your forehead and belly and then you meet your own\cb3 \ \cb1 eyes in the shimmering mirror as you\cb3 \ \cb1 stare into your own reflection take a moment to simulate a knee ously hold\cb3 \ \cb1 your heart in your awareness let the\cb3 \ \cb1 loving compassionate energy of your heart be the source of the healing or\cb3 \ \cb1 clearing that is possible here\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you hold your own gaze in this mirror you sense that you are returning\cb3 \ \cb1 to yourself how long you wonder has it\cb3 \ \cb1 been since you've been this lovingly attuned to your own inner reflection and\cb3 \ \cb1 yet while love is indeed present here you might find that limiting judgements\cb3 \ \cb1 about who you are or where you've been come up to the surface because sometimes\cb3 \ \cb1 when we attempt to love cherish or accept ourselves the mind rises with its\cb3 \ \cb1 whispers of resistance often these inner\cb3 \ \cb1 judgmental whispers are subtle and yet they can have such a strong effect on\cb3 \ \cb1 how much love forgiveness and kindness we are able to grant ourselves\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] so in order to clear whatever stories\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts or beliefs that may be holding you back from unconditional\cb3 \ \cb1 self-acceptance and reconciliation with your true self you look at yourself in\cb3 \ \cb1 the mirror as you slowly repeat these words I love you I'm sorry please\cb3 \ \cb1 forgive me thank you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] I love you I'm sorry\cb3 \ \cb1 please forgive me thank you\cb3 \ \cb1 I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you\cb3 \ \cb1 spend some time now on your own in silence cultivating these words and an\cb3 \ \cb1 energy of deep care and consideration for yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 as you whisper these words I love you I'm sorry please forgive me and thank\cb3 \ \cb1 you invisible knots of resentment judgment\cb3 \ \cb1 and wrongdoing begin to untangle themselves from your body your body\cb3 \ \cb1 becomes lighter your mind becomes freer and your heart becomes more loving\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever you may hold against yourself and whatever you may have done in the\cb3 \ \cb1 past does not define who you really are\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath the wise and loving energy of forgiveness you are able to clear\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself you repeat these affirmations\cb3 \ \cb1 three more times now each I love you I'm\cb3 \ \cb1 sorry please forgive me\cb3 \ \cb1 thank you I love you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I'm sorry please forgive me\cb3 \ \cb1 thank you I love you I'm sorry\cb3 \ \cb1 please forgive me [Music] thank you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] now the words dissipate into the\cb3 \ \cb1 atmosphere around you as you come back to the quiet space with him you meet\cb3 \ \cb1 your reflection in the mirror once again feeling a wave of gratitude washed\cb3 \ \cb1 through you you are grateful for the energies of love kindness and\cb3 \ \cb1 forgiveness is showing up today and you are grateful for this return to yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 for this inner reconciliation\cb3 \ \cb1 if you need some more time to connect with your loving center imagine yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 resting a hand upon your heart and breathing into that space each\cb3 \ \cb1 inhalation brings a wave of self-love and each exhalation frees you from the\cb3 \ \cb1 entanglement of judgment resentment and the past\cb3 \ \cb1 you take one last look in the mirror and then you turn away from it and back\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the beautiful room that holds you and as you rest here grounded in\cb3 \ \cb1 both the earth and in your heart take a moment to consider if there is anyone\cb3 \ \cb1 you might like to offer this loving forgiving and clearing energy to\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 when you feel ready to simply offer to any individuals or to the universe at\cb3 \ \cb1 large the loving-kindness that has cleared you here tonight\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you were ready come back to your breath and to the homey room that\cb3 \ \cb1 supports you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take three full deep breaths in your own timing now surrendering any residual\cb3 \ \cb1 tension with a sigh as needed [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let your breath resume its natural rhythm after that third deep breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and within the image of this inner sanctuary envision yourself coming to\cb3 \ \cb1 curl up on the floor or a couch within this room envision yourself fully\cb3 \ \cb1 supported by cushions and blankets and then gently close your eyes on even this\cb3 \ \cb1 visualization\cb3 \ \cb1 as you come back to your body and to the reality that holds you know that the\cb3 \ \cb1 energies you cultivated in this sacred home are now embedded within you as you\cb3 \ \cb1 drift into sleep they were strengthened their roots so that you will soon embody their wisdom\cb3 \ \cb1 in each and every cell of your being\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your body to melt taking a brief moment to notice if there is any tension\cb3 \ \cb1 that might like to be released or any adjustments that need to be made and as\cb3 \ \cb1 you surrender into this space that hold you allow this Hawaiian prayer to\cb3 \ \cb1 continue clearing your inner world of that which no longer serves you\cb3 \ \cb1 I love you I'm sorry\cb3 \ \cb1 please forgive me thank you\cb3 \ \cb1 I love you I'm sorry please forgive me\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] thank you I love you\cb3 \ \cb1 I'm sorry please forgive me\cb3 \ \cb1 thank you I

experiencing faith while things\cb3 \ \cb1 may not feel aligned with the life of your dreams just yet that's okay\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] simply work with what you have and begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to move towards what you want you can't\cb3 \ \cb1 change the past so be careful not to dwell there or attach expectations based\cb3 \ \cb1 on the past\cb3 \ \cb1 as you imagine the outcome of your manifestation you may see vivid pictures\cb3 \ \cb1 in your mind or you may find emotions arising within you you may have specific\cb3 \ \cb1 answers to some questions or they may come later connect with everything

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello and welcome to this short\cb3 \ \cb1 guided meditation that will help you to\cb3 \ \cb1 relax\cb3 \ \cb1 deeply as you release and transform\cb3 \ \cb1 any troubles you are experiencing with\cb3 \ \cb1 the help of the ocean's waves\cb3 \ \cb1 my name is jason stevenson and i invite\cb3 \ \cb1 you to open your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 and mind to this transformative practice\cb3 \ \cb1 let the top of your head stretch up\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the ceiling\cb3 \ \cb1 and your shoulders to soften towards the\cb3 \ \cb1 earth\cb3 \ \cb1 eyes closed and turn your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 inwards as you observe the gentle rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 of your breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you watch the breath flow into\cb3 \ \cb1 and out of your lungs notice how it\cb3 \ \cb1 resembles the steady flow of waves\cb3 \ \cb1 against a sandy beach\cb3 \ \cb1 in this moment your body is the shore\cb3 \ \cb1 and the breath is the ebb and flow\cb3 \ \cb1 of nature's mysterious force\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments to let the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 naturally guide you into a deeper state\cb3 \ \cb1 of relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 just as the ocean's waves tend to lull\cb3 \ \cb1 us\cb3 \ \cb1 into a place of peace and tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 soften your belly as you breathe and\cb3 \ \cb1 relax your shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 seeing if the breath might like to move\cb3 \ \cb1 a bit deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 into your body you don't need to force\cb3 \ \cb1 anything\cb3 \ \cb1 simply observe the rhythm that is\cb3 \ \cb1 present\cb3 \ \cb1 and now i invite you to turn your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention towards the mind's eye\cb3 \ \cb1 to the seat of your capacity for\cb3 \ \cb1 inspired visualization\cb3 \ \cb1 and from within this space i invite you\cb3 \ \cb1 to imagine that you were standing\cb3 \ \cb1 firmly grounded on a warm\cb3 \ \cb1 tropical beach\cb3 \ \cb1 the ocean just a dozen meters ahead of\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 sparkles beneath the beaming sun\cb3 \ \cb1 soft waves crash gently against the\cb3 \ \cb1 steady shore\cb3 \ \cb1 forever flowing back out to the vastness\cb3 \ \cb1 from which they came\cb3 \ \cb1 the air is a comfortable temperature\cb3 \ \cb1 warming each cell bone\cb3 \ \cb1 and corner of your soul\cb3 \ \cb1 you look left and right\cb3 \ \cb1 realizing that no one is here but you\cb3 \ \cb1 this healing space is all yours to enjoy\cb3 \ \cb1 in peace and tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 so take a moment to ground yourself by\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling the soles of your feet\cb3 \ \cb1 against the multitude of grains of sand\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 the warmth from this surface permeates\cb3 \ \cb1 up through your legs\cb3 \ \cb1 your pelvis\cb3 \ \cb1 running up the length of your spine\cb3 \ \cb1 and then expanding outwards through your\cb3 \ \cb1 arms\cb3 \ \cb1 and up to the crown of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 you tilt your head gently as your face\cb3 \ \cb1 extends\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the sun\cb3 \ \cb1 and you begin to feel any weight you've\cb3 \ \cb1 been carrying\cb3 \ \cb1 melt from your body\cb3 \ \cb1 take a long deep breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 and out\cb3 \ \cb1 and slowly you make your way closer\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the water's edge\cb3 \ \cb1 you pause just a few meters away from it\cb3 \ \cb1 and settle yourself into the sand\cb3 \ \cb1 coming to a seated position\cb3 \ \cb1 feel into the sensation of the warm\cb3 \ \cb1 sandy surface embracing\cb3 \ \cb1 each inch of your skin that comes into\cb3 \ \cb1 contact with it\cb3 \ \cb1 as you sink into this unfolding moment\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin to surrender any barriers that\cb3 \ \cb1 exist within you\cb3 \ \cb1 to experience deep peace\cb3 \ \cb1 and relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 you know that in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing you need to do\cb3 \ \cb1 nothing you need to accomplish\cb3 \ \cb1 and nothing you need to be\cb3 \ \cb1 you know that you are enough as you are\cb3 \ \cb1 and that this moment is enough\cb3 \ \cb1 as it is\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you watch the luminous waves\cb3 \ \cb1 crashing against the sandy shore just\cb3 \ \cb1 before you\cb3 \ \cb1 you offer up to these transformative\cb3 \ \cb1 waters\cb3 \ \cb1 any troubles you've been experiencing\cb3 \ \cb1 lately\cb3 \ \cb1 all limitation or challenging thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 feelings emotions and stories\cb3 \ \cb1 leave your body with each breath out\cb3 \ \cb1 and as the energy of these thoughts and\cb3 \ \cb1 feelings\cb3 \ \cb1 flow through the breeze towards the\cb3 \ \cb1 ocean\cb3 \ \cb1 you watch as they are swept away for\cb3 \ \cb1 healing and transformation\cb3 \ \cb1 as each wave rushes back\cb3 \ \cb1 into the ocean abyss\cb3 \ \cb1 take some time consciously\cb3 \ \cb1 offer up anything you might like to\cb3 \ \cb1 release to these cleansing waters\cb3 \ \cb1 watch all of your troubles be\cb3 \ \cb1 washed gracefully away\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you were ready take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 come back\cb3 \ \cb1 to the simple beauty of this relaxing\cb3 \ \cb1 space\cb3 \ \cb1 to the sounds of the wondrous waves\cb3 \ \cb1 to the nourishment of each cleansing\cb3 \ \cb1 breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and to the warm glow of the soothing sun\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to relax upon this serene\cb3 \ \cb1 beach\cb3 \ \cb1 for just a few more silent breaths\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly now let the imagery of this\cb3 \ \cb1 tranquil landscape dissolve\cb3 \ \cb1 as you take three deep and grounding\cb3 \ \cb1 breaths\cb3 \ \cb1 on your own rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 and after that last long exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 let your breath return to its natural\cb3 \ \cb1 cycle\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you feel ready to come back to\cb3 \ \cb1 the world around you\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly open your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 you might want to spend some time here\cb3 \ \cb1 just over the next five minutes\cb3 \ \cb1 listening to the sounds of the waves as\cb3 \ \cb1 you slowly come back\cb3 \ \cb1 let the relaxing energy of this beach\cb3 \ \cb1 move you\cb3 \ \cb1 through the day ahead or the evening\cb3 \ \cb1 tapping into your inner source of peace\cb3 \ \cb1 and release again\cb3 \ \cb1 and again\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \ \cb1 English (auto-generated)\cb3 \ \ \ \ }

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello this is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation\cb3 \ \cb1 designed to help you release what you've been holding on to and to help ease you\cb3 \ \cb1 into a deep and restorative night's sleep the intention behind this\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation is to help you to let go of that which you have been clinging on to\cb3 \ \cb1 surrendering it to a higher force through this process of letting go\cb3 \ \cb1 you're free up misplaced energy finding a greater sense of lightness freedom and\cb3 \ \cb1 pure state of being this mysterious and\cb3 \ \cb1 often misunderstood force to which your surrender may feel or sound like the\cb3 \ \cb1 word God or universal energy or consciousness or it may be by some other\cb3 \ \cb1 name that is comfortable and familiar to you you may even choose to leave it\cb3 \ \cb1 unnamed whatever the case this idea of a\cb3 \ \cb1 force simply points towards the energy that makes all of this life possible\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever term or non term becomes your guiding force for this meditation is\cb3 \ \cb1 entirely welcomed and accepted this energy will be the bed that\cb3 \ \cb1 nourishes you throughout the duration of this meditation and all the way into\cb3 \ \cb1 your sleep this recording is designed to be an anchor before bedtime for a\cb3 \ \cb1 consecutive 21 days over the course of these three weeks you will be repeatedly\cb3 \ \cb1 guided to let go of that which no longer serves you allowing the transformative\cb3 \ \cb1 powers of some higher force to nurture hold and awaken every level of your\cb3 \ \cb1 being before we begin I invite you now to ensure that all end of day activities\cb3 \ \cb1 are taken care of lights are switched off ringers are silenced and blinds are\cb3 \ \cb1 drawn make your way into a comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 lying down position using any cushions and blankets required to support you\cb3 \ \cb1 through this transformative journey and then into a deep and restful sleep make\cb3 \ \cb1 any adjustments necessary allowing your body to begin the process of relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling yourself sink a little bit further into the surface that support\cb3 \ \cb1 you throughout this journey as is the\cb3 \ \cb1 case with any meditation you may experience rising emotions or other\cb3 \ \cb1 challenging sensations if these waves come to you know that is\cb3 \ \cb1 safe to feel into them allow the space that holds you the air that surrounds\cb3 \ \cb1 you and the force that lives within you to carry you through whatever arises\cb3 \ \cb1 just surrender these energies to the higher power that supports all of life\cb3 \ \cb1 note that each day of this meditation will be set against a different emotional backdrop know that from day to\cb3 \ \cb1 day this meditation will feel and look unique as you process it in your own\cb3 \ \cb1 natural way know that whatever arises is entirely okay and that whatever comes up\cb3 \ \cb1 is in fact required to be seen in order for you to move through it and finally\cb3 \ \cb1 know that you are unconditionally supported through this journey [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment now to connect with your breath without attempting to change it\cb3 \ \cb1 in any way simply notice its natural rhythm in this very moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the way that without any action on your part the breaths innate wisdom\cb3 \ \cb1 guides itself into the body gently and back out to the world around you allow\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath to be your anchor into the present moment throughout this process of letting go\cb3 \ \cb1 for a few breaths now bring your awareness to your belly\cb3 \ \cb1 simply observe this part of the body and notice that wherever your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 flows the breath goes to witness the\cb3 \ \cb1 natural rise and fall of the stomach with each inhalation and each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the body becoming more relaxed with each deep breath taken and feel\cb3 \ \cb1 that sinking further into this space that support you\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to bring awareness to the truth that just by being here in this\cb3 \ \cb1 very moment you are already beginning the process of releasing by allowing the\cb3 \ \cb1 body to rest deeply into this present moment you are immersed within the\cb3 \ \cb1 journey of releasing limited notions that have been carried for quite some\cb3 \ \cb1 time with your attention turn towards\cb3 \ \cb1 each breath you are continuously being grounded into the present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 surrendering your thoughts to that which exists all around you to cosmic energy\cb3 \ \cb1 to the source of all life\cb3 \ \cb1 throughout this meditation your mind may become subject to wondering if this is\cb3 \ \cb1 the case in any moment simply observe this tendency of the mind to lose its\cb3 \ \cb1 focus to wander into the past or into the future and into deeply entrenched\cb3 \ \cb1 beliefs about yourself or about life in general and know that this movement is\cb3 \ \cb1 entirely natural observe each mental\cb3 \ \cb1 shift away from the present moment with compassion and non judgment as humans\cb3 \ \cb1 with the capacity for self consciousness it is entirely natural for the mind to\cb3 \ \cb1 wander now if it's here and not to reject or deny these movements but to\cb3 \ \cb1 simply observe them and then to guide awareness back to the breath or some\cb3 \ \cb1 other anchor to the present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] with each mental meandering that arises\cb3 \ \cb1 simply witness it and then guide your attention back to your breath or to the\cb3 \ \cb1 sound of my voice take a few moments\cb3 \ \cb1 here to gently follow the breath allowing it to guide you further into\cb3 \ \cb1 this present moment releasing any mental\cb3 \ \cb1 notions of the past present or future\cb3 \ \cb1 simply allow yourself to be right here\cb3 \ \cb1 right now\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 letting go requires a complete surrender of our mental energy often this process\cb3 \ \cb1 brings up uncomfortable sensations and deep feelings of fear whatever we have\cb3 \ \cb1 been holding on to has become interwoven with our experience and expectation of\cb3 \ \cb1 happiness letting go requires us to surrender into the deep and knowing that even without\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever beliefs ideas people or objects we have been clinging to we are entirely\cb3 \ \cb1 whole entirely loved and entirely free\cb3 \ \cb1 our attempts to control the world around us are born out of fear fear that we may\cb3 \ \cb1 not receive enough love or money or safety or nourishment or anything\cb3 \ \cb1 else for that matter through exerting control we often believe that we can\cb3 \ \cb1 ensure that our future will play out the way we hope for it to letting go of this\cb3 \ \cb1 belief requires a leap of faith a leap into knowing that everything we\cb3 \ \cb1 require will be provided by this cosmic force greater than us\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment once again to tune in to the breath acknowledging any sensations\cb3 \ \cb1 feelings or emotions that may be rising\cb3 \ \cb1 simply witness these uprisings if they present themselves as passing waves that\cb3 \ \cb1 do not belong to you allow them to come and allow them to go without fixating on\cb3 \ \cb1 any mental ideas about what they are why they are there or what their purpose is\cb3 \ \cb1 simply observe them without thought\cb3 \ \cb1 without judgment and with unconditional acceptance and compassion\cb3 \ \cb1 the act of surrender requires what may feel like a courageous leap into the\cb3 \ \cb1 unknown and yet on the other side of\cb3 \ \cb1 this leap is the sensation of freedom\cb3 \ \cb1 by letting go of our attempts to control or to manipulate the world around us we\cb3 \ \cb1 release vast stores of energy this\cb3 \ \cb1 energy does not disappear from us but instead repurposes itself energy that\cb3 \ \cb1 was once tied up in fear becomes energy intertwined with love trust and peace\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment now to come into the body due to the intricate interconnection of\cb3 \ \cb1 mind and body we can help to ease the mind and support its surrender through\cb3 \ \cb1 release and relaxation of the body just\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to follow my voice as we journey now through the body with each\cb3 \ \cb1 body part mentioned allow your attention to flow there allow each area to be\cb3 \ \cb1 infused with breath with warmth and with love allow each area to release any\cb3 \ \cb1 tension it may be carrying\cb3 \ \cb1 begin by drawing your awareness to your toes gently feeling into them softening them\cb3 \ \cb1 with your awareness [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 regarde and release now both feet [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the ankles\cb3 \ \cb1 the lower legs softening\cb3 \ \cb1 your knees [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and your upper legs\cb3 \ \cb1 witnessin release any remaining tension within the entirety of both legs now\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your attention to and relax the buttocks\cb3 \ \cb1 pelvis\cb3 \ \cb1 your hips\cb3 \ \cb1 release now your belly softening let go\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you'll lower back and gently move up the spine to soften\cb3 \ \cb1 the entirety of the back\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the chest to soften and the heart to relax\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your awareness upwards along both arms beginning at the tips of your\cb3 \ \cb1 fingers slowly softening each part of\cb3 \ \cb1 the arm along your journey upwards\cb3 \ \cb1 when you arrive at the shoulders take a moment to witness and relax both\cb3 \ \cb1 shoulders and the entirety of both your arms\cb3 \ \cb1 soften now the Nick both front and back\cb3 \ \cb1 release any tension in the jaw\cb3 \ \cb1 the mouth\cb3 \ \cb1 your cheeks\cb3 \ \cb1 knows\cb3 \ \cb1 your ears\cb3 \ \cb1 and your eyes and the eye sockets\cb3 \ \cb1 soften the eyebrows and the phorid\cb3 \ \cb1 and then witness and relax the top of the head\cb3 \ \cb1 the back of your head relaxing\cb3 \ \cb1 and now your entire head gently softening letting go\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment now to observe the whole body feeling it melt into the surface\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath it and as the body relaxes more deeply\cb3 \ \cb1 notice how the mind follows\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few deep breaths you allowing both body and mind to continue sinking\cb3 \ \cb1 into the universal energy that supports them\cb3 \ \cb1 as you continue your personal journey of letting go know that you are deeply\cb3 \ \cb1 supported by the higher force that exists around and within you this\cb3 \ \cb1 all-knowing and ever-present energetic force is a safe loving and\cb3 \ \cb1 supportive container capable of holding and transforming all mental beliefs\cb3 \ \cb1 stories and attachments this divine energy and its support can be called\cb3 \ \cb1 upon at any point to assist with your individual process take a moment now to\cb3 \ \cb1 bring your awareness to the heart space [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 it may be helpful to slowly envision the mind descending melting into the non\cb3 \ \cb1 thinking space of your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 begin now to breathe from the heart allowing it to expand on each inhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 and soften on each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 through the heart we are better able to recognize our connection to this oneness\cb3 \ \cb1 that supports all of life by allowing\cb3 \ \cb1 your mind to descend and melt away we begin to operate from the hearts knowing\cb3 \ \cb1 from this deep faith and trust in the universe through the heart we operate\cb3 \ \cb1 from a knowing that there is no need to control the world around us and there is\cb3 \ \cb1 no need to latch on to anything we begin\cb3 \ \cb1 to feel into the safety and support that is always present and available to us\cb3 \ \cb1 as you slowly edge further towards sleep allow your breath to rock you into a\cb3 \ \cb1 deeply transformative state of relaxation where this surrendering\cb3 \ \cb1 process will continue each breath guides\cb3 \ \cb1 you back to the present moment each mindful breath is an act of\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 by releasing any mental beliefs we carry we allow ourselves to come further into\cb3 \ \cb1 the body into the breath and into the feeling of this present moment by\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing the stories of our past and the beliefs about our present and our future we break overly used energy\cb3 \ \cb1 patterns so that we may repurpose our energetic stores the use by our highest\cb3 \ \cb1 and most divinely connected selves feel into the freedom the love and the peace\cb3 \ \cb1 that presents itself by way of this sweet surrender I invite you now to\cb3 \ \cb1 gently introduce a few words to help reaffirm this process of letting go and\cb3 \

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will help you to\cb3 \ \cb1 effortlessly wind down and to fall asleep quickly by consciously inviting\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation into your body and mind and by using the power of visualization you\cb3 \ \cb1 will soon enter a deeply relaxed state that is conducive of a solid night's\cb3 \ \cb1 slumber my name is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to follow me on this journey\cb3 \ \cb1 as you slowly surrender to sleep I\cb3 \ \cb1 invite you now to begin drawing your attention to your physical body and making any adjustments necessary to\cb3 \ \cb1 facilitate relaxation use any cushions\cb3 \ \cb1 or blankets you need for warmth or support and also ensure that any\cb3 \ \cb1 distracting lights are turned off and that your blinds are drawn\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 see if you can comfortably form one straight line from tailbone to neck and\cb3 \ \cb1 then let your limbs relax wherever they are comfortable close your eyes if\cb3 \ \cb1 you've not done so and take a few slow and steady breaths to settle in\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as we move through this meditation know that there is nothing you need to achieve or accomplish simply let these\cb3 \ \cb1 words flow effortlessly through you use them to ground your attention if the\cb3 \ \cb1 mind wanders away into less than settling thoughts now let us begin by\cb3 \ \cb1 practicing some deep belly breathing to help us shift further into the body's\cb3 \ \cb1 rest and digest state of being so begin by drawing your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention to the stomach perhaps placing a hand there if you like\cb3 \ \cb1 and after your next full exhalation take\cb3 \ \cb1 a deep breath in letting the belly expand as the air enters into you hold\cb3 \ \cb1 the breath at the top for just a second and then slowly let the air back out\cb3 \ \cb1 through the pursed lips just watching the belly fall when you reach the bottom\cb3 \ \cb1 hold the air out for just a second or two and then take another full deep\cb3 \ \cb1 breath in so continue to breathe in this\cb3 \ \cb1 way for just a few moments on your own letting each inhalation and each\cb3 \ \cb1 exhalation belong letting the belly rise and fall with each cycle and also\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing for a second pause at the end of each in-breath and each out breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue breathing this way for a short while longer letting your attention\cb3 \ \cb1 ground in the sensation of breathing [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and after your next exhalation allow your breath to resume its natural depth\cb3 \ \cb1 pace and rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 note what it feels like to be in your body now observing any shifts that you\cb3 \ \cb1 may have already experienced\cb3 \ \cb1 remember that during meditation when you are invited to note your experience\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing expected of you just simply allow your experience to be what\cb3 \ \cb1 it is in this moment trusting that everything is moving you towards a\cb3 \ \cb1 greater state of harmony\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and take a moment now to draw your attention to the physical body noting\cb3 \ \cb1 any areas of unconscious contraction\cb3 \ \cb1 it is not uncommon to hold tension in the brow in the shoulders in the belly\cb3 \ \cb1 or in your hips and so as you observe\cb3 \ \cb1 the fullness of your body in this moment see where you might be able to soften to\cb3 \ \cb1 surrender more completely to the earth beneath you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if there is tension or discomfort that cannot be consciously relaxed I invite\cb3 \ \cb1 you to instead send that area a few loving words of support\cb3 \ \cb1 you might even silently ask what part of\cb3 \ \cb1 me is calling for attention here bless\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever aspect of mind or body comes to your awareness by sending it your\cb3 \ \cb1 kindness and care\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now in just a moment we'll begin a soothing visualization that will help\cb3 \ \cb1 you to wind down even further but before we do just take a moment to notice the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface that hold you notice the\cb3 \ \cb1 stillness of your body and the support of the physical world\cb3 \ \cb1 just open yourself up to the beauty of this simple quiet moment before we\cb3 \ \cb1 transition in the realm of inspired imagination\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now I invite you to begin visualizing that you are standing in a wide-open\cb3 \ \cb1 enchanted corridor with windows lining the wall to your right\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the high ceiling above you boasts a floral mural peach violet and gold\cb3 \ \cb1 flowers intertwined with vines decorate the space overhead the hallway feels\cb3 \ \cb1 majestic as if you are in an old palace that time has forgotten old pieces of\cb3 \ \cb1 artwork lined the walls and yet you know the space is well-kept as there are no\cb3 \ \cb1 signs of dust or debris it is well kept in your mind at the very least\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and off to your right through the\cb3 \ \cb1 expansive windows that line the corridor you peer out over crystal waters a sea\cb3 \ \cb1 extends as far as the eye can see the\cb3 \ \cb1 skies clear birds frolic in the sky and\cb3 \ \cb1 the waves are caressing the shore the\cb3 \ \cb1 Sun is slowly setting upon this peaceful land casting a dark pink light across\cb3 \ \cb1 the horizon yearning to smell the sea\cb3 \ \cb1 breeze you crack open a window and take a full deep nourishing breath in and you\cb3 \ \cb1 let it back out [Music] another deep salty breath in through the\cb3 \ \cb1 nostrils and then slowly release once\cb3 \ \cb1 again [Music] each breath of this fresh air cleanses\cb3 \ \cb1 you purifying body mind and soul\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you step away from the window now curious as to where this corridor might\cb3 \ \cb1 lead you the world outside is beautiful and inspiring you long for a deep and\cb3 \ \cb1 nourishing rest and so you decide to head out in search of a place to lay\cb3 \ \cb1 your head you turn away from the window\cb3 \ \cb1 now and slowly make your way down the corridor your feet tread lightly you are\cb3 \ \cb1 completely aware of each moment you make [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you carry on down the hallway pausing as you reach a closed door at the end above\cb3 \ \cb1 the doorway there is a sign that reads to the cave of peace something settles\cb3 \ \cb1 within you simply upon reading this sign and so you slowly reach out your hand to\cb3 \ \cb1 pull open the door just on the other\cb3 \ \cb1 side an enchanted spiral staircase presents itself undoubtedly leading you\cb3 \ \cb1 down towards the cave of peace below the\cb3 \ \cb1 number 10 is etched in gold on the stone wall of the staircase suggesting you are\cb3 \ \cb1 ten flights up from the earth below you take a moment to prepare for the descent\cb3 \ \cb1 admiring the smooth stone walls the marble staircase and the gold-plated\cb3 \ \cb1 hand railing that spirals effortlessly downwards you take a deep breath in and\cb3 \ \cb1 out and then you begin taking the twisting\cb3 \ \cb1 steps towards the ninth floor as you\cb3 \ \cb1 reach the landing of the ninth floor you feel a weight fall from your shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 all the worries of the day have been released and you feel yourself breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 deeper easier than you did before you arrived here as your shoulders drop away\cb3 \ \cb1 from your ears your heart space opens you feel light and free after a full\cb3 \ \cb1 mindful breath you carry on towards the eighth floor gliding graciously down the\cb3 \ \cb1 marble steps [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 when you arrive on this next landing you feel your jaw drop and your brow relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 your head space begins to feel lighter as you open more fully to this journey\cb3 \ \cb1 of deep release taking a full deep\cb3 \ \cb1 breath in and out\cb3 \ \cb1 and then you carry on slowly down the staircase taking your time to reach the\cb3 \ \cb1 seventh floor landing\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] when you arrive there you feel a wave of\cb3 \ \cb1 gratitude wash over you you feel grateful for the air that nourishes you\cb3 \ \cb1 for the space that holds you and for the beauty that lives within you silently\cb3 \ \cb1 thank the universe for all that you were blessed with\cb3 \ \cb1 after another mindful breath you carry on down the staircase pausing when you\cb3 \ \cb1 reach the sixth floor\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] here on the sixth floor you take a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment to tune into your heart and are flooded with the sense of embodied\cb3 \ \cb1 self-love self-care and self compassion\cb3 \ \cb1 something within you awakens to your own divinity and in response you feel a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 sense of appreciation for who you are exactly as you are you take another\cb3 \ \cb1 moment to revel in this sense of self appreciation before continuing on down\cb3 \ \cb1 the marble staircase [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you come to reach the fifth floor something within you whispers for you to\cb3 \ \cb1 let go perhaps it is a belief you've been holding on to that no longer serves\cb3 \ \cb1 you or a worry you've been carrying too heavily\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] whatever within you might be ready to\cb3 \ \cb1 depart breathe it out with a deep exhalation before continuing down\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the fourth floor [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you'll and gracefully on the fourth floor landing and as you do you are\cb3 \ \cb1 overcome with a sense of deep trust in the universe you realize that every\cb3 \ \cb1 single step you've taken in this life has brought you to where you are now and\cb3 \ \cb1 where you are now here in this enchanted staircase is serving you in countless\cb3 \ \cb1 ways you trust that this is exactly\cb3 \ \cb1 where you were meant to be and after taking a mindful breath here you\cb3 \ \cb1 continue your descent [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 soon you reach the third floor where something within you whispers this\cb3 \ \cb1 moment is enough this moment is enough\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you pause here grounding your two feet into the solid floor beneath you you\cb3 \ \cb1 peer out through a window that overlooks the sea just beyond these walls and your\cb3 \ \cb1 heart opens even wider to embrace the peace and simplicity of this moment yes\cb3 \ \cb1 you think to yourself this moment is enough\cb3 \ \cb1 continuing the descent you move your feet again allowing them to carry you\cb3 \ \cb1 gracefully to the landing below as you\cb3 \ \cb1 arrive on the second floor you pause yet again full presence comes to you now\cb3 \ \cb1 there is nothing you seek nothing you are grasping at and while yes\cb3 \ \cb1 some part of you longs to rest completely by dozing off into slumber\cb3 \ \cb1 there is no anxiety in you about it you\cb3 \ \cb1 know that you will arrive there very soon and that it will be this peaceful\cb3 \ \cb1 present energy that assists you in getting to that state with ears\cb3 \ \cb1 two more flights to go and so you continue your journey towards the first\cb3 \ \cb1 floor landing as you arrive on the main\cb3 \ \cb1 floor you feel completely and deeply grounded fully aware of your connection\cb3 \ \cb1 to the earth beneath and around you you know that you are well rooted in this\cb3 \ \cb1 life and in this moment you feel centered stable and supported\cb3 \ \cb1 a sign by the top step of the next set of stairs reads to the cave of peace and\cb3 \ \cb1 so you take a full deep breath once again then you make your way step by\cb3 \ \cb1 step to that final floor just beneath the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you step off that final stair you\cb3 \ \cb1 find yourself in a wide-open room that is indeed cave-like and lit with candles\cb3 \ \cb1 it is the most elegant cave you have ever seen majestic in its outfit\cb3 \ \cb1 a splendid rug the color of mole breeze and the Tuscan Sun covers much of the\cb3 \ \cb1 floor off to the side a four-poster bed\cb3 \ \cb1 sits elegantly it is adorned with plush cushions and blankets that cause you\cb3 \ \cb1 towards it and yet before you go you\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to admire the quietude of this space the simplicity the elegance\cb3 \ \cb1 and the comfort\cb3 \ \cb1 the candle light soothes your soul as it flickers against the walls of the cave\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and now ready to rest your head you take\cb3 \ \cb1 a moment to gently blow out all of the candles in the room leaving the one next\cb3 \ \cb1 to your bed for last\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you make your final preparations for\cb3 \ \cb1 sleep and then you crawl into the cozy bed before you when you are settled you blow\cb3 \ \cb1 out the last remaining candle and sink into the darkness of this room your body\cb3 \ \cb1 rejoices at the comfort of this place you have found yourself in it feels well\cb3 \ \cb1 supported and fully nourished in this abode the space is quiet cozy and\cb3 \ \cb1 peaceful and so you prepare to let your entire body ease into a deep slumber\cb3 \ \cb1 there's settle more completely you come back to your breath held safely in this\cb3 \ \cb1 night you allow your belly to soften and the breath to flow as deep as it is\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable to\cb3 \ \cb1 with each breath ian you feel a sense of universal love and support entering you\cb3 \ \cb1 and with each breath out you free yourself of any tension that no longer\cb3 \ \cb1 serves you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath resumes its natural pace now as you draw your attention to the top of\cb3 \ \cb1 your head as you hold this space in your\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness you send it your love and invite it to relax as you exhale gently\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention shifts towards the space between your eyebrows and in the same\cb3 \ \cb1 way you witness love and ease this part\cb3 \ \cb1 of you through your presence and through your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you continue in the same way nourishing\cb3 \ \cb1 your cheeks and your jaw\cb3 \ \cb1 your tongue and your mouth softening\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxing\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and your throat and shoulders dropping\cb3 \ \cb1 letting go [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] next you trace the length of your left\cb3 \ \cb1 arm all the way to your fingertips inviting it to soften into the surface\cb3 \ \cb1 beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] repeating the same on the opposite side\cb3 \ \cb1 you allow your right arm to be seen and to relax completely you trace it from\cb3 \ \cb1 the right shoulder all the way to your fingertips draw your attention now back\cb3 \ \cb1 to the heart space holding this loving center of your being in full awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe into the heart watch it\cb3 \ \cb1 expand and as you exhale from the heart\cb3 \ \cb1 allowed to soften\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention slowly shifts down your spine relaxing each vertebrae and the\cb3 \ \cb1 surrounding muscles as you gently make your way towards your stomach and as you\cb3 \ \cb1 hold your belly in your awareness you offer it your love and invite it to rest\cb3 \ \cb1 for the night\cb3 \ \cb1 you hold your pelvis and your hips and your loving awareness next breathing\cb3 \ \cb1 into it and out of this space completely\cb3 \ \cb1 and then slowly you draw this loving awareness down the left-leg inviting it\cb3 \ \cb1 to relax in its entirety all the way\cb3 \ \cb1 down to your toes [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you then come back up to the right hip and slowly repeat this process of\cb3 \ \cb1 softening as you scan the length of your right leg\cb3 \ \cb1 all the way down to your toes\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now hold your entire body in your awareness letting each inhalation move\cb3 \ \cb1 all the way into the farthest reaches of your being and each exhalation to soften\cb3 \ \cb1 the entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the body is relaxed the mind is relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 and now nothing stands between you and a\cb3 \ \cb1 deep peaceful sleep [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the envisioned room in your mind's eye dissolves as you realize you are once\cb3 \ \cb1 again in the room that holds you physically and though you are no longer\cb3 \ \cb1 in the cave of peace that once held you it has bestowed its energy upon each one\cb3 \ \cb1 of yourselves it's peaceful presence remains with you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] continue to mind your breath gently now\cb3 \ \cb1 as you slowly

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello and welcome to this powerful guided meditation my name is Jason\cb3 \ \cb1 Stephenson thank you for joining me this mindfulness meditation and visualization\cb3 \ \cb1 will lead you with compassion and curiosity deeper and deeper into a state\cb3 \ \cb1 of relaxation and then into the past before eventually carrying you into a\cb3 \ \cb1 deep and peaceful sleep I invite you to open your heart to this journey to\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever reveals itself knowing that you are unconditionally supported in each\cb3 \ \cb1 and every moment that passes\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the mind to rest aside as we move backwards through time there is nothing\cb3 \ \cb1 you will need to actively search for and nothing you'll need to find images and\cb3 \ \cb1 inner sensations may come for you but you will not need to control them\cb3 \ \cb1 manipulate them or force them in any way\cb3 \ \cb1 simply allow yourself to open up entirely to whatever moves through you\cb3 \ \cb1 as we take this journey allow this\cb3 \ \cb1 meditation in each moment to naturally reveal itself as you move deeper and\cb3 \ \cb1 deeper into the past so before we begin\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment or two to come into a comfortable lying down position ensure\cb3 \ \cb1 that you feel safe and secure wherever you are\cb3 \ \cb1 ensure that your neck is aligned with the spine and your shoulders are relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] take a moment to consciously release all\cb3 \ \cb1 muscles as you sink further into this supportive surface beneath you take a\cb3 \ \cb1 few deep breaths here grounding yourself in this present moment use your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 to guide you towards a place of complete stillness [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 although we will be moving through the expansive field of time you can always\cb3 \ \cb1 ground yourself back into the present moment if you feel uncomfortable at any\cb3 \ \cb1 point you are in complete control of this journey so if any images or\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations arise that are too challenging for you to present Lee look\cb3 \ \cb1 at simply use your breath to anchor yourself back into the present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 you are always always in control of your\cb3 \ \cb1 journey with that said if any challenging images\cb3 \ \cb1 arise or if the experience becomes heavy you are also in an entirely safe domain\cb3 \ \cb1 to explore them images that arise in our consciousness can never hurt us they are\cb3 \ \cb1 solely tools or teachers that hold the potential to guide us forward in\cb3 \ \cb1 powerful and positive ways know that you\cb3 \ \cb1 are universally supported in each and every moment\cb3 \ \cb1 now take a moment to come back to your body\cb3 \ \cb1 notice your sense of touch through the way the surfaces around you make contact\cb3 \ \cb1 with your physical body feel into the textures that are present\cb3 \ \cb1 without moving noting how they feel as\cb3 \ \cb1 they rest against your skin [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 consider the deeper levels of the physical body is it possible to become\cb3 \ \cb1 mindful of the cellular world [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice your muscles and then invite them to relax\cb3 \ \cb1 encouraging them to sink further into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 now consider the presence of air around your body and then gently follow it as\cb3 \ \cb1 it moves within filling your lungs fully\cb3 \ \cb1 as you take a breath in and returning to\cb3 \ \cb1 the world around you on your exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the breath to become slow and steady just like the subtle lapping of\cb3 \ \cb1 waves against the shoreline\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few breaths on your own here following the innate rhythm of this life\cb3 \ \cb1 force that supports you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 allow yourself to come into a state of relaxation by drawing your breath to the\cb3 \ \cb1 heart space as you inhale allow your\cb3 \ \cb1 heart to expand filling itself to the outer edges with peace joy and clarity\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you exhale allow the walls of the heart to soften releasing any tension\cb3 \ \cb1 that may be stored there [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe this way for a few more rounds effortlessly quietening the\cb3 \ \cb1 mind as you move closer and closer towards the true state of your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to notice a growing sense of peace and tranquility as you become more\cb3 \ \cb1 attuned

somehow\cb3 \ \cb1 beckoning you closer\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a few steps towards this mist very slowly and mindfully and as you\cb3 \ \cb1 approach it begins to dissipate as it\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly clears you begin to see there is a bridge ahead of you covered in moss\cb3 \ \cb1 and vines you make your way towards it\cb3 \ \cb1 mindfully treading on the pressed earth beneath your feet and as you cross over\cb3 \ \cb1 everything you ever knew begins to disappear all thought all attachments\cb3 \ \cb1 all fears and all worries\cb3 \ \cb1 you are entering into a new world into a different time\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] with every step you take you inch closer\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the space and time just on the other side of the bridge it is a place\cb3 \ \cb1 that feels familiar somehow but one that your conscious mind cannot put any\cb3 \ \cb1 memory to the mist continues to clear\cb3 \ \cb1 and you realize you are within a dense majestic forest you feel at home you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel at peace here\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] he reached the other side of the bridge\cb3 \ \cb1 and with the mist having vanished completely now you take a closer look at\cb3 \ \cb1 the scenery around you notice the colors and

[Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 allow this place to nurture the deep sense of peace that is within you\cb3 \ \cb1 he walk forward ever so slightly as you noticed something peeking through from\cb3 \ \cb1 within the trees and as you approach you\cb3 \ \cb1 realize there is a cabin hidden within these woods and somehow you sense that\cb3 \ \cb1 it is or was your own you instantly\cb3 \ \cb1 remember it perhaps becoming flooded with visions of what it was once like in\cb3 \ \cb1 your own time you reach the front door and enter\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] take a few moments to witness the\cb3 \ \cb1 visuals that are arising [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 what does the cabin look like what happened here once upon a time\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] who is with you\cb3 \ \cb1 imagery may come slowly and subtly\cb3 \ \cb1 simply allow them to arise in their own time allow your imagination and\cb3 \ \cb1 intuition to expand quite effortlessly\cb3 \ \cb1 mindfully consider what was once here that no longer remains\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 remain open to whatever arises there is no need to fear the past it no longer\cb3 \ \cb1 has any control over you simply allow yourself to become the outside observer\cb3 \ \cb1 of whatever you feel has happened here\cb3 \ \cb1 watch this film play out as if you are a viewer rather than the character at\cb3 \ \cb1 center stage [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe deeply as you simply observe whatever is present without\cb3 \ \cb1 judgment or condemnation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as we move through this time we shed old\cb3 \ \cb1 ways of being in order to make room for more expansive ones mindfully begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 consider what messages or lessons are being shared through these images that are arising what is there to be learned\cb3 \ \cb1 what is there to shed\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the mind to remain quiet as your\cb3 \ \cb1 intuition arises tune in with your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 opening yourself to the possibility of transformation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] return to your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 and to the aroma of the woods\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few more moments to witness whatever once happened at this beautiful\cb3 \ \cb1 cabin in the forest\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and slowly in your own time\cb3 \ \cb1 returned to the bridge slowly crossing back over as you return\cb3 \ \cb1 to the present physical reality you\cb3 \ \cb1 passed through the mist once more making your way to the other side 10 you are\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing deeply 9 you feel inspired and uplifted by what\cb3 \ \cb1 you have learned 8 you are calm and\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxed seven your breath flows as steady as\cb3 \ \cb1 gentle waves caressing the shore [Music]\cb3 \

\cb1 with the past now behind you you feel deeply settled within this present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment you know that the past cannot be changed but that it provides opportunity\cb3 \ \cb1 for growth and expansion everything you\cb3 \ \cb1 witnessed now dissipates just as the mist did as you crossed over and into\cb3 \ \cb1 the past you are still and silent and\cb3 \ \cb1 for the moment nothing remains to be seen\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue to allow positive and empowering lessons to reach you as you\cb3 \ \cb1 transition into a sleeping state but you are not in search of anything you are\cb3 \ \cb1 ready to rest easy for the entire night ahead dozing off swiftly and soundly\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few more breaths mindfully inhaling peace contentment and freedom\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and exhaling everything whatever once\cb3 \ \cb1 was [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 the only place that truly exists is this very moment everything that once was can\cb3 \ \cb1 be used as

breaths\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if your mind is wandering it's no big deal that is typical as the momentum of\cb3 \ \cb1 the day gradually slows simply become\cb3 \ \cb1 aware of your thoughts just as they are with acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 notice these thoughts arising and passing by notice with curiosity and\cb3 \ \cb1 permission rather than the need for change the mind will not stop thinking\cb3 \ \cb1 completely so you can choose to notice accept and\cb3 \ \cb1 allow these thoughts to pass by [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you acknowledge and allow your thoughts to pass you can begin to slip\cb3 \ \cb1 deeply into relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 become aware of your breath just as it is\cb3 \ \cb1 notice with curiosity all there is to notice about your natural graph without\cb3 \ \cb1 the need to have it be something that it is not already\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] since your breath without the need to\cb3 \ \cb1 change it in any way [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 our breath is always there for us in the background an automatic action\cb3 \ \cb1 let the inhale and exhale guide you into\cb3 \ \cb1 a calm deeply relaxed State\cb3 \ \cb1 become aware of your inner physical experience just as it is notice how you\cb3 \ \cb1 are showing up to this practice not needing to be something else\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] not needing to be somewhere different\cb3 \ \cb1 than exactly where you are\cb3 \ \cb1 take note of exactly where you are on your journey with acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you can give yourself permission to\cb3 \ \cb1 simply be\cb3 \ \cb1 peace is available when we stop resisting any given moment\cb3 \ \cb1 notice your body sensations just as they are\cb3 \ \cb1 notice any body pain with acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 notice anybody pleasure with acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 notice any neutral areas with acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 settle into your body except being in\cb3 \ \cb1 your body right now just as you are\cb3 \ \cb1 take this time to be with yourself move\cb3 \ \cb1 closer to yourself accepting all that\cb3 \ \cb1 you are\cb3 \ \cb1 there is no need to make a change during meditation be just as you are accepting\cb3 \ \cb1 allows us to fully experience what is happening in the present moment to fully\cb3 \ \cb1 engage in life [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 know that without suffering we cannot know joy without darkness we cannot know\cb3 \ \cb1 light allowing life as it is can lessen\cb3 \ \cb1 any struggle and perhaps additional unnecessary suffering when you feel life\cb3 \ \cb1 brings you challenges you can't accept you have the opportunity to be\cb3 \ \cb1 transformed by acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 you may add suffering when you resist the way things are because they aren't\cb3 \ \cb1 the way you expect or want them to be\cb3 \ \cb1 you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the\cb3 \ \cb1 way things are naturally there is a\cb3 \ \cb1 possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 peace is available when you stop resisting any given moment\cb3 \ \cb1 become aware of your whole body in your environment\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] notice where your body makes contact\cb3 \ \cb1 with the surface beneath you and feel yourself being grounded\cb3 \ \cb1 since the weight of your body making a strong anchoring connection\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let go into gravity to feel heavy into your support notice the fabric of your\cb3 \ \cb1 clothes on your skin or the areas of exposed skin feeling the\cb3 \ \cb1 touch of the air simply be aware of your\cb3 \ \cb1 experience in this moment [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 scan your body for any areas of tension\cb3 \ \cb1 except your experience as it is and then\cb3 \ \cb1 use your attention to welcome a softening\cb3 \ \cb1 a sense of ease to move throughout your body [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you observe your body soften and release any areas you are able\cb3 \ \cb1 invite in the feeling of peace as you begin to tune out the whole world around\cb3 \ \cb1 you and go within with my voice as a\cb3 \ \cb1 soothing guide to help you sleep in a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the top\cb3 \ \cb1 of your head going all the way through your body down to your feet as I say\cb3 \ \cb1 each part of your body you can see that part in your mind's eye notice what is\cb3 \ \cb1 true with acceptance so that you can invite relaxation to that body part\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind encourage the\cb3 \ \cb1 weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface below you so\cb3 \ \cb1 that there is no need to hold on you can simply let go into sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 now as you begin to scan your body bring\cb3 \ \cb1 your attention to the top of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to notice the sensations here [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and then relax the top of your head and your scalp\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] welcome this ease into your forehead and\cb3 \ \cb1 eyes relax any facial expression release\cb3 \ \cb1 the tiny muscles around your eyes and\cb3 \ \cb1 feel your eyelids becoming heavy allow\cb3 \ \cb1 your cheeks to soften\cb3 \ \cb1 unclench your jaw and allow your teeth\cb3 \ \cb1 to part\cb3 \ \cb1 become aware of the area of your neck and throat and with acceptance of your\cb3 \ \cb1 present moment experience completely\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 as you accept yourself just as you are\cb3 \ \cb1 you allow each muscle to relax in progression and this invites a deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 sense of relaxation to the parts of your\cb3 \ \cb1 body that came before it in your body scan\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to notice except\cb3 \ \cb1 and relax as you invite a sense of peace\cb3 \ \cb1 and stillness to your shoulders chest\cb3 \ \cb1 and arms\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps feeling a comfortable heaviness move into your ribs abdomen and back\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of any gripping in your hips and\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your thighs to rest heavy on the surface below you as if there is no\cb3 \ \cb1 difference between where you end and where the surface begins\cb3 \ \cb1 you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part\cb3 \ \cb1 allows it to relax and let go\cb3 \ \cb1 since now your ankles and feet\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing and relaxing completely\cb3 \ \cb1 take another moment to slowly scan your body once more\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] this time notice any areas that may\cb3 \ \cb1 still be holding on to any lingering tension and after acknowledging and\cb3 \ \cb1 accepting your present experience ask\cb3 \ \cb1 your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in\cb3 \ \cb1 control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe\cb3 \ \cb1 and supported and knows what to do to relax if you\cb3 \ \cb1 simply allow the tension to release\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 in addition to the added suffering that occurs when you resist the way things\cb3 \ \cb1 are you may also experience suffering when you are not accepting of yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 self-acceptance means accepting yourself exactly as you are without any wishes of\cb3 \ \cb1 how you should be there is a possibility\cb3 \ \cb1 for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true\cb3 \ \cb1 the practice of self-acceptance is a step toward freedom and happiness in\cb3 \ \cb1 your life\cb3 \ \cb1 self-acceptance is knowing deep down in your heart that you are enough as you\cb3 \ \cb1 are it means being comfortable with your\cb3 \ \cb1 body your emotions and your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 it means accepting what you have achieved as well as what you have not\cb3 \ \cb1 yet accomplished\cb3 \ \cb1 acceptance of all your strengths as well as what you may consider your flaws\cb3 \ \cb1 it means being exactly who you are and not who you want others to see you as\cb3 \ \cb1 accepting yourself is not about praising yourself or receiving praise from others\cb3 \ \cb1 it means that you have a sense from within that you feel loved simply\cb3 \ \cb1 because you are being yourself [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 when you love and accept yourself you are authentic and can trust yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 the first step on the path of self-acceptance is increased awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 as you build this awareness of yourself invite any feelings you may be having to\cb3 \ \cb1 show up fully\cb3 \ \cb1 welcome both positive and negative and\cb3 \ \cb1 honor what they are without judging or\cb3 \ \cb1 trying to change accept any positive\cb3 \ \cb1 emotions and know that you deserve to feel good\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and when negative emotions come to the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface treat yourself as you would a loved one with kindness and compassion\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 know that these emotions are just that emotions\cb3 \ \cb1 they are not you they do not make you the person that you are\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] notice your emotions as they show up for\cb3 \ \cb1 you now [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 since the physical feelings of your emotions and where in your body you may\cb3 \ \cb1 be experiencing them\cb3 \ \cb1 notice with curiosity and acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 experience your emotions just as they are let go of what you may think your\cb3 \ \cb1 thoughts or your emotions should be\cb3 \ \cb1 without changing anything simply meet yourself exactly where you are in the\cb3 \ \cb1 present moment and be aware of yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 the second step towards self-acceptance is loving-kindness and compassion for\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself in order to fully love and\cb3 \ \cb1 accept yourself you must let go of limiting beliefs and self-defeating\cb3 \ \cb1 behaviors let go of anything that no\cb3 \ \cb1 longer serves you on your journey to self-acceptance\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to let go of all the behaviors and beliefs that no longer\cb3 \ \cb1 serve you or are working against you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] there is no need to name these\cb3 \ \cb1 specifically right now simply let the negative energy go and replace it with\cb3 \ \cb1 positive energy\cb3 \ \cb1 make space for acceptance [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of judgments of ourselves and comparisons to others\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of unmet and unrealistic expectations\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of the need for perfection to be\cb3 \ \cb1 human is to be imperfect\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of comparisons with past versions of yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of negative self-talk\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of shame and let go of guilt\cb3 \ \cb1 let it all go see all of this melting\cb3 \ \cb1 off of your body to be gone from your life forever without going into story or\cb3 \ \cb1 naming specific events let go of blame\cb3 \ \cb1 of ourselves and others let the heavy\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling float off your shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of blame of our circumstances\cb3 \ \cb1 let the sensation dissolve from your muscles\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] let go of judgment of good and bad\cb3 \ \cb1 when we practice meditation we can choose to befriend our circumstances\cb3 \ \cb1 with compassion\cb3 \ \cb1 in a moment I will guide your subconscious with some positive\cb3 \ \cb1 affirmation statements of acceptance of reality as well as acceptance of self\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] there is no need to repeat these if you\cb3 \ \cb1 are so relaxed you are almost sleeping\cb3 \ \cb1 your subconscious will hear them simply\cb3 \ \cb1 believe they are true continue to relax\cb3 \ \cb1 fully and know that at the core of your\cb3 \ \cb1 being these statements are true allow\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself to drift off to sleep with the sound of my voice if you wish through\cb3 \ \cb1 acceptance comes freedom and peace\cb3 \ \cb1 I allow my thoughts to be what they are\cb3 \ \cb1 I have the strength to accept what I perceive to be a challenge or an\cb3 \ \cb1 obstacle\cb3 \ \cb1 I trust that challenges will make me stronger\cb3 \ \cb1 I allow life to be exactly what it is I\cb3 \ \cb1 am loving and accepting of others\cb3 \ \cb1 I accept

lying down position\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 wherever you are and sure that the spine and neck are straight but relaxed and\cb3 \ \cb1 that you are supported in any way that you need take your time to adjust any\cb3 \ \cb1 cushions or blankets so the gyrus comfortable as possible in\cb3 \ \cb1 this very moment [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 set an intention now to fully let go through both body and mind as we enter a\cb3 \ \cb1 process of complete release now let's\cb3 \ \cb1 begin by becoming more mindful of this exact moment in time and space begin by\cb3 \ \cb1 drawing your awareness to your ears and to all the sounds that you may currently\cb3 \ \cb1 be infiltrating through them\cb3 \ \cb1 you open your hearing simply observe all the sounds that come from subtle hums to\cb3 \ \cb1 more prominent noises outside you\cb3 \ \cb1 without judging or labeling these sounds practice remaining in a state of deep\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness as vibrations filter into your eardrums and as they disappear\cb3 \ \cb1 allow the Mayans tendencies to categorize to label and the judge to\cb3 \ \cb1 step aside as you simply witness these noises as dynamic expressions of life as\cb3 \ \cb1 simple and subtle vibrations of energy\cb3 \ \cb1 now expand your awareness of this present moment by beginning to observe\cb3 \ \cb1 the physical space you rest in notice\cb3 \ \cb1 the air that touches your skin and the material world that supports and\cb3 \ \cb1 surrounds you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a few moments to observe each inch of your body that is in contact with the\cb3 \ \cb1 physical world [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you might come to notice the temperature of your body and surfaces around you you\cb3 \ \cb1 might observe the textures of blankets and pillows that brush against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and you might even observe a barely describable feeling of support of safety\cb3 \ \cb1 or of heaviness as you sink further into\cb3 \ \cb1 the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 notice if the body's formation or sensory experience changes in any way as\cb3 \ \cb1 you become more mindful of this physical space you are in\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 become more mindful now of your breath quietly observing the rhythm and depth\cb3 \ \cb1 of its present form [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 to be mindful does not mean to change or to manipulate the present moment in any\cb3 \ \cb1 way that the mind deemed to make better or worthy to the contrary mindful\cb3 \ \cb1 awareness asks us to open to and to accept this moment exactly as it is so\cb3 \ \cb1 with this in mind see if you can open to your breath exactly as it is right now\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing any judgment or expectation for it to feel any differently than it\cb3 \ \cb1 presently does [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if a natural deepening occurs allow this\cb3 \ \cb1 simply noticing it as a natural movement of energy further into your being\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to observe the breath for a few more moments feeling into the expression\cb3 \ \cb1 of each inhalation and each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the feeling of air entering through your nasal cavity filling your\cb3 \ \cb1 lungs and pressing upward against your\cb3 \ \cb1 belly [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and then notice the same dynamic movement in Reverse observing any\cb3 \ \cb1 sensations connected to your fall exhalation [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 just breathe here in mindful awareness for a few more silent moments\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if the mind wanders at any point during this meditation see if you can refrain\cb3 \ \cb1 from judgment as you compassionately call your attention back to the present\cb3 \ \cb1 moment it is in the minds nature to wander but with that said we can use the\cb3 \ \cb1 power of our intention to refocus our attention back on this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 this refocusing is what helps us to enter an expanding state of complete of\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 in just a few moments we will enter into a full-body scan through which you will\cb3 \ \cb1 become deeply aware of the presence of tightness in the body and then of the\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling of complete relaxation you will\cb3 \ \cb1 be guided to witness tighten and release each area that we pass allowing each\cb3 \ \cb1 part of the body to come to deep rest and complete ease in preparation for a\cb3 \ \cb1 peaceful night's sleep [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as much as possible see if you can align tightening movements with your\cb3 \ \cb1 inhalations and all movements towards release with your exhalations\cb3 \ \cb1 just breathe naturally in between each muscle group that we work on\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] so before we begin into this body scan I\cb3 \ \cb1 invite you to make any adjustments now that will help you to feel into the\cb3 \ \cb1 entirety of your body you might find that it is easiest to access each muscle\cb3 \ \cb1 when in a straight line down position on your back however if this is not\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable for you come into a position that is as neutral as possible while\cb3 \ \cb1 remaining comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 ensure that the chest is open with shoulders drawing away from the ears\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your breath to continue to be in the background of your awareness\cb3 \ \cb1 secondary only to your gently shifting awareness of the physical body so begin\cb3 \ \cb1 by noticing your toes feeling into them exactly as they are in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 notice if there are any sensations present any tiredness or softness\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and now consciously tighten just your toes on your next inhalation observing\cb3 \ \cb1 what it feels like for them to be pulled inwards completely and then exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 letting them go and allowing all tension melting away with ease [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now bring your awareness towards both feet toes and ankles included observing\cb3 \ \cb1 them exactly as they are in this moment\cb3 \ \cb1 on the next breath in tensor muscles in the feet area holding tightly for just a\cb3 \ \cb1 brief moment and then release all of the tension on your exhalation allowing your\cb3 \ \cb1 feet toes and ankles to rest back down completely and breathing normally for a\cb3 \ \cb1 few moments [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 observe now the presence of both of your lakes drawing your awareness all the way\cb3 \ \cb1 from your heels up to your hips noting any sensations you pass along the way\cb3 \ \cb1 hold the entirety of both legs in your awareness and then inhale as you tighten\cb3 \ \cb1 these muscles squeezing them in towards\cb3 \ \cb1 your midline hold there for a moment and\cb3 \ \cb1 then exhale releasing them completely into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 moving to the area between the hips draw your awareness to your pelvis on your\cb3 \ \cb1 next breath in tighten all of these muscles holding them for just a brief\cb3 \ \cb1 moment and then release them completely on your next breath out just feel into\cb3 \ \cb1 this complete release from your pelvis downward letting each of these areas\cb3 \ \cb1 sink further into the support of the physical world\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 observe the stomach region now becoming aware of its present state\cb3 \ \cb1 and then as you inhale tighten all of these core muscles holding them in\cb3 \ \cb1 tightly for just a moment as you hold the breath in and then release entirely\cb3 \ \cb1 as you exhale softening all muscles around the belly return to your natural\cb3 \ \cb1 breathing rhythm as you relax the stomach completely\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now expand your awareness of the stomach to encompass the entire tosser from\cb3 \ \cb1 lower back to upper and from belly up to the shoulders take a moment now to\cb3 \ \cb1 observe each muscle group in the core of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now on your next inhalation tighten them or towards the midline of your body\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling them in a contracted state and then release heavily with a sigh\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing your entire torso to relax completely [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment here to reconnect with your breath mindfully observing its\cb3 \ \cb1 present form [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 bring your awareness now to your hands fingers included observe the way they\cb3 \ \cb1 are resting in this moment noticing if they are relaxed or tense or somewhere\cb3 \ \cb1 in between [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you inhale allow all of these muscles in the hands and fingers to tighten\cb3 \ \cb1 coming into a compressed fist hold for a\cb3 \ \cb1 brief second or two and then exhale as you release allowing both hands to rest\cb3 \ \cb1 completely relaxed\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 draw your awareness now from your wrists all the way up to your shoulders and\cb3 \ \cb1 compasses all the muscles and areas in between so inhale as you contract all of\cb3 \ \cb1 these muscles perhaps pulling them up towards your ears and then soften releasing all of\cb3 \ \cb1 these muscles in the limbs back down shoulders falling back down gently as\cb3 \ \cb1 well notice how different it feels in\cb3 \ \cb1 both body and mind between your contracted States and your\cb3 \ \cb1 softened ones\cb3 \ \cb1 now begin to observe all of the intricate muscles in your face noticing\cb3 \ \cb1 if there are any sensations present here\cb3 \ \cb1 consider the muscles in your jaw your\cb3 \ \cb1 cheeks your eyebrows and your forward\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now inhale as you contract all of these muscles squeezing your entire face\cb3 \ \cb1 together hold for just a moment observing the sensation and then exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 as you release all of these muscles completely let go of each muscle\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing all tension to drain away [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to come back to your breath for just a moment observing the\cb3 \ \cb1 entire body right where it is and right as it is\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 observe this neutral state just for a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 and then on your next inhalation contract every muscle group accessible\cb3 \ \cb1 to your awareness squeezing the entirety of your body towards your midline hold\cb3 \ \cb1 everything together with the breath held in and then release completely letting a deep sigh escape from your\cb3 \ \cb1 lungs as all remaining tension and stress falls away allow each muscle to\cb3 \ \cb1 melt into the surface beneath you\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm as you sing further and\cb3 \ \cb1 further into the experience of this complete relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to breathe naturally mindfully observing the flow of air into and out\cb3 \ \cb1 of your being [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 in this state of deep relaxation and release there is absolutely nothing to\cb3 \ \cb1 do but be entirely present\cb3 \ \cb1 with every muscle group relaxed completely you are moments away from\cb3 \ \cb1 drifting into a peaceful sleep that is in alignment with your present state of\cb3 \ \cb1 tranquillity allow your breath to become\cb3 \ \cb1 like waves your body is soft and gentle as the water beneath the service as you\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe notice yourself being rocked gently into an even deeper state of\cb3 \ \cb1 tranquillity\cb3 \ \cb1 the mind follows the body's lead quietening softening\cb3 \ \cb1 as you come into harmony with everything within and around you\cb3 \ \cb1 with every inch of your being having been consciously relaxed allow yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 to float effortlessly into a deep slumber allow your breath and the sounds\cb3 \ \cb1 to soothe your entire being as you slowly but surely descend completely\cb3 \ \cb1 into restorative and peaceful night's sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 and allow these affirmations to sink into your subconscious mind even if you\cb3 \ \cb1 do fall asleep trust that these affirmations will assist you as you\cb3 \ \cb1 drift deeper deeper into sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 I am relaxing deeper and deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 my mind is slowing down\cb3 \ \cb1 all tension is melting away [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I let go of all my worries [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1

\f0\fs22 \cf2 hello and welcome to this guided meditation and visualization that will\cb3 \ \cb1 help you to cleanse negative energy from both mind and body before leading you\cb3 \ \cb1 into a restorative night's sleep my name\cb3 \ \cb1 is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to set the world you know aside as you open\cb3 \ \cb1 your heart and mind to the possibility of awakening new inspired energy to\cb3 \ \cb1 begin take a moment to find a comfortable lying down position and\cb3 \ \cb1 using whatever blankets and pillows you need for support and then closing your\cb3 \ \cb1 eyes when you're ready\cb3 \ \cb1 soften your brow [Music] your jaw\cb3 \ \cb1 and your limbs just allowing your entire body to soften into the surface beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 before we dive deeper into this visualization let's take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 mindfully tune into the present moment beginning with the breath noticing the\cb3 \ \cb1 path that your breath takes as it moves through you beginning as it enters your\cb3 \ \cb1 nostrils moves through your windpipe and\cb3 \ \cb1 fills your lungs\cb3 \ \cb1 and then notice the same path but in Reverse watching how the chest and belly\cb3 \ \cb1 soften as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 observe that gentle subtle movement of the body as you breathe becoming more\cb3 \ \cb1 aware of the aliveness of your being\cb3 \ \cb1 and now as the breath enters I invite you to draw your attention towards the\cb3 \ \cb1 stomach welcoming the breath to flow all the way into it and as you exhale let\cb3 \ \cb1 the belly soften completely\cb3 \ \cb1 just take a few more deep belly breaths on your own now\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps releasing a softer sigh with your next view exhalations\cb3 \ \cb1 and now I invite you to let the breath expand even further by imagining each\cb3 \ \cb1 inhalation reaching into the furthest corners of your body into your toes your\cb3 \ \cb1 fingertips and your crown\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you come to exhale imagine the breath taking with it any and all\cb3 \ \cb1 tension lingering anywhere within the body\cb3 \ \cb1 you breathe into the fullness of your being\cb3 \ \cb1 and then invite your entire body to release as you exhale\cb3 \ \cb1 take just a few more full-body breaths on your own\cb3 \ \cb1 when you were ready to let go of even this breathing technique let your breath\cb3 \ \cb1 resume its natural pace depth and rhythm\cb3 \ \cb1 in a few moments we will begin a visualization that will help you to\cb3 \ \cb1 cleanse any negative energy you may be holding and as we move through this\cb3 \ \cb1 practice I invite you to remain compassionate and patient towards\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself softening any judgement if it arises I\cb3 \ \cb1 encourage this because it is not uncommon that we feel shame guilt or\cb3 \ \cb1 judgment when we consider that we have been harnessing negative thoughts\cb3 \ \cb1 feelings or other energies and yet all\cb3 \ \cb1 of these things are a part of the human experience they offer us opportunities\cb3 \ \cb1 to learn evolve and awaken\cb3 \ \cb1 regardless of where this negative energy may have come from I invite you to\cb3 \ \cb1 release any stories you might hold about wrongdoing\cb3 \ \cb1 and by softening shame and guilt and through opening up to ourselves with\cb3 \ \cb1 compassion and patience we lovingly create space to release what no longer\cb3 \ \cb1 serves us and to invite in the energy that will\cb3 \ \cb1 so take a moment now to draw your attention to the crown of your head\cb3 \ \cb1 gently softening any tension you might observe here or in the space of the\cb3 \ \cb1 third eye\cb3 \ \cb1 relax your shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 your arms release your belly\cb3 \ \cb1 and any other unnecessary tension and\cb3 \ \cb1 then come back to your breath as we prepare to cleanse our energy field\cb3 \ \cb1 through the power of this visualization\cb3 \ \cb1 calling upon your innate capacity for imagination now I invite you to envision\cb3 \ \cb1 that you are on a small chartered boat sailing calmly and gently towards the\cb3 \ \cb1 shore of a pristine tropical island\cb3 \ \cb1 you sit or stand at the prow breathing in the fresh salty breeze of the open\cb3 \ \cb1 sea around you\cb3 \ \cb1 you have charted this small boat for an island getaway for a chance to rest\cb3 \ \cb1 reset and cleanse yourself of any negative energy you've been exposed to\cb3 \ \cb1 or have been holding on to\cb3 \ \cb1 and as the boat nears the dock at the shore you feel your shoulders releasing\cb3 \ \cb1 some of the unnecessary weight they've been carrying\cb3 \ \cb1 no breathing deepens\cb3 \ \cb1 and finally the boat pulls up against the dock overhanging the turquoise\cb3 \ \cb1 waters\cb3 \ \cb1 you carefully step on to the steady dock turning to thank the captain and to let\cb3 \ \cb1 him know that you will be back later in the day then you head on your way your\cb3 \ \cb1 backpack is full of all you need for the day and so pulling the straps tight now\cb3 \ \cb1 you begin your journey through the pathway that leads through the tropical\cb3 \ \cb1 jungle oasis\cb3 \ \cb1 palm trees and other lush greenery line the narrow trail you find yourself on\cb3 \ \cb1 birds ring out in the trees overhead as do chirping insects and croaking\cb3 \ \cb1 amphibians\cb3 \ \cb1 the air is completely free of any man-made sounds you relish in this in\cb3 \ \cb1 the purity of the symphony that fills your ears\cb3 \ \cb1 already you can feel your lungs being cleansed your breath moving deeper and\cb3 \ \cb1 your body being filled with pristine air full of vitality\cb3 \ \cb1 you continued on a little while longer weaving through the jungle of this\cb3 \ \cb1 private island\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] eventually you come across a shimmering\cb3 \ \cb1 Azure Blue Lagoon just off to your right\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a moment's pause here kneeling down by the water's edge\cb3 \ \cb1 something about this Lagoon feels enchanted something tells you that the\cb3 \ \cb1 water is listening that it is aware of your presence\cb3 \ \cb1 so you take this as an invitation to consciously set the intention to release\cb3 \ \cb1 any negative energy that has been harbored within you take a moment to\cb3 \ \cb1 formulate this intention in your own words\cb3 \ \cb1 and when you were ready you whisper this intention to the pristine mystic waters\cb3 \ \cb1 before you\cb3 \ \cb1 you sense that simply through having set this intention something has been\cb3 \ \cb1 released and that the process of deep cleansing and rejuvenation has been\cb3 \ \cb1 upgraded\cb3 \ \cb1 so you take a few final moments to absorb the beauty of this Lagoon\cb3 \ \cb1 and then you continue along the path that has gotten ooh this far\cb3 \ \cb1 continuing to make your way through the lush environment you've retreated to you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel a deep sense of gratitude for this opportunity to clear your energy field\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] not only do you thank the environment\cb3 \ \cb1 that is supporting you now but you also feel a sense of appreciation for the\cb3 \ \cb1 part of you that made this retreat a priority you thank yourself for this act\cb3 \ \cb1 of self-care\cb3 \ \cb1 you carry on until soon the path widens\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly transitioning from soil to sand\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you make your way through the last layers of trees on this opposite\cb3 \ \cb1 side of the island your jaw drops at the purity of the white sand beach before\cb3 \ \cb1 you and at the calm turquoise waters\cb3 \ \cb1 that ripple out from the island you've\cb3 \ \cb1 arrived at a place where you can allow all remaining negativity to be cleared\cb3 \ \cb1 from your being you are certain that this is the place for it\cb3 \ \cb1 and so you take off your shoes carrying\cb3 \ \cb1 them in one hand as you walk closer towards the water you walk slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 allowing your feet to sink into the warm sand with each step\cb3 \ \cb1 a few meters from where the soft wave slap against the shore you drop your bag\cb3 \ \cb1 and your shoes letting your feet ground into the sand rooting yourself through\cb3 \ \cb1 your feet you then stretch your arms up towards the sky your heart opens as your\cb3 \ \cb1 chest pushes forward welcoming the radiance of the Sun the sky and sea\cb3 \ \cb1 you let your arms come to rest by your sides now as you gaze out over the open\cb3 \ \cb1 waters with not a single other landmass\cb3 \ \cb1 inside you feel as if you're a world away from the everyday you take a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 breath in and letting it go with a sigh\cb3 \ \cb1 and then you lay out your towel and prepare to head into the calm and cleansing waters\cb3 \ \cb1 you remember the intention you had said to cleanse yourself of any negative\cb3 \ \cb1 energies perhaps negative thoughts feelings habits or more subtle energies that no\cb3 \ \cb1 longer serve you and as you begin\cb3 \ \cb1 walking towards the water you invite these negative energies to come to the\cb3 \ \cb1 forefront of your mind and you hold them\cb3 \ \cb1 here not to judge criticize or condemn\cb3 \ \cb1 them but to silently let them know that you can see them and to let them know\cb3 \ \cb1 that it is time for them to be let go\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly wading into the water you let the cool sea brush against your skin\cb3 \ \cb1 beginning to cleanse you from the outside\cb3 \ \cb1 continuing on until you are waist-deep you pause and then you bring your palms\cb3 \ \cb1 together in front of your body inviting all negative energies to be held between\cb3 \ \cb1 them\cb3 \ \cb1 raising your arms up and overhead you let these negative energies begin moving\cb3 \ \cb1 away from your body\cb3 \ \cb1 and you throw them forward sending them off into the sea\cb3 \ \cb1 as your hands dip underwater all the negative energies you once held begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 dissolve in the salty water that surrounds you you let the water to\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to cleanse you of all negative energies that you do not wish to hold on\cb3 \ \cb1 to\cb3 \ \cb1 you can even watch all the negative attachments float away from you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] all negative beliefs and stories\cb3 \ \cb1 all self-limiting beliefs\cb3 \ \cb1 and any of the negative energies you've picked up from the world around you all\cb3 \ \cb1 of it is now dissolving in the ocean\cb3 \ \cb1 feel free to roll on your back floating here safely for some time as the\cb3 \ \cb1 sunshine beams down on you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly the subtle waves carry you back towards the shoreline and as you get\cb3 \ \cb1 closer you rise to your feet and slowly make your way back onto the beach\cb3 \ \cb1 resting your back on your towel you lie down here and let the Sun and the\cb3 \ \cb1 Seabreeze continue to cleanse you you\cb3 \ \cb1 notice there is far more room to breathe now to breathe in light love and\cb3 \ \cb1 positivity the negative energies you\cb3 \ \cb1 once held now feel so distant and all\cb3 \ \cb1 you are left with is room to grow new ideas new beliefs and new dreams and to\cb3 \ \cb1 conjure up new energies you feel immensely blessed for this\cb3 \ \cb1 transformation\cb3 \ \cb1 and as the Sun beams down on you you sense it awakening each and every cell\cb3 \ \cb1 in your body\cb3 \ \cb1 it awakens the cells in your toes your\cb3 \ \cb1 feet\cb3 \ \cb1 your lower legs\cb3 \ \cb1 your knees and your thighs\cb3 \ \cb1 it reinvigorates the cells in your hips your pelvis and your root chakra\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] it brings new life to your belly your\cb3 \ \cb1 lower back your chest and your heart and\cb3 \ \cb1 your upper back\cb3 \ \cb1 and in the same way it awakens all the cells in your arms from your fingertips\cb3 \ \cb1 right up to your shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 the cells and energy center in your throat awakens to as do all the cells in\cb3 \ \cb1 your face\cb3 \ \cb1 finally the top of your head the crown area\cb3 \ \cb1 opens up to the sunlight completely becoming a portal for positive energy to\cb3 \ \cb1 flow through your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 you are fully alive here fully awake and\cb3 \ \cb1 positively inspired\cb3 \ \cb1 you come back to your breath letting each inhalation spread throughout your\cb3 \ \cb1 entire body and each exhalation to\cb3 \ \cb1 soften you you melt into the sand a\cb3 \ \cb1 little bit further with each breath knowing there is nothing you need to hold on to here\cb3 \ \cb1 a great wave of compassion washes through you as you bless yourself but\cb3 \ \cb1 the places you've been and the courage of harnessed to arrive here letting go\cb3 \ \cb1 and allowing for cleansing to happen is not always easy and so you feel immense\cb3 \ \cb1 appreciation to yourself for opening up in this way\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you also feel a growing compassion for all those who've crossed your path for\cb3 \ \cb1 those who have been weighed down by their own negative energy - you see the\cb3 \ \cb1 goodness and light at the core of everything\cb3 \ \cb1 you spend just a few more moments here on the sand beneath the Sun\cb3 \ \cb1 and then you slowly rise to your feet and prepare to head back to the boat\cb3 \ \cb1 that awaits you\cb3 \ \cb1 you take one last look at the beach and see that so graciously held you offering\cb3 \ \cb1 them your thanks and you turn towards\cb3 \ \cb1 the path that brought you here slowly venturing back into the tropical\cb3 \ \cb1 abyss\cb3 \ \cb1 as you walk you feel a lightness in your\cb3 \ \cb1 steps and in your entire body you move\cb3 \ \cb1 with ease and grace all parts of you are now deeply cleansed\cb3 \ \cb1 soon you make your way back to the lagoon where you had powerfully set your\cb3 \ \cb1 intention you pause at its edge letting\cb3 \ \cb1 an inner smile spread through you\cb3 \ \cb1 all of a sudden the tropical Symphony begins to grow louder the birds chirp\cb3 \ \cb1 with glee from their perches the frogs croak with contentment and the insects\cb3 \ \cb1 sing in their own way it sounds to you\cb3 \ \cb1 as though the jungle is applauding rejoicing in this return to your natural\cb3 \ \cb1 state of being\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue on your way leaving the lagoon behind positive energy continues\cb3 \ \cb1 to spread through you\cb3 \ \cb1 eventually you arrive back at the outer limits of the jungle noting the dock and\cb3 \ \cb1 the boat that awaits you slowly you make\cb3 \ \cb1 your way over towards it thanking the captain for his time\cb3 \ \cb1 you climb back in taking a comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 seat on the boat and as it slowly pulls\cb3 \ \cb1 away from the dock and the island you look back in love and admiration of your\cb3 \ \cb1 experience here you consider how\cb3 \ \cb1 unconditionally you were held by the sand and by the sea feeling in complete\cb3 \ \cb1 alignment with the world you thank the\cb3 \ \cb1 sea for cleansing you of the energies you no longer needed and you imagine\cb3 \ \cb1 these energies slowly sinking to the ocean floor where they will be\cb3 \ \cb1 transformed into their raw pure elements\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as the boat continues towards the\cb3 \ \cb1 nearest mainland you let your back come to rest on its surface it's smooth and\cb3 \ \cb1 steady journey across the water lulls you towards slumber a state that will\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to process all of the transformation you experienced here\cb3 \ \cb1 you take one more deep breath in of the sea breeze and as you exhale you gently\cb3 \ \cb1 release the imagery of this beautiful cleansing landscape\cb3 \ \cb1 grounding yourself back into the surface that supports you in this reality\cb3 \ \cb1 carrying the experience of being cleansed into the awakened life notice\cb3 \ \cb1 the natural ebb and flow of your breathing using it to anchor you anytime\cb3 \ \cb1 the mind wanders in these next few moments before sleep and as you slowly\cb3 \ \cb1 drift off let the following affirmations flow through you to reaffirm the\cb3 \ \cb1 cleansing that has taken place as these words float through your subconscious\cb3 \ \cb1 mind they will help to embed this new reality into your daily life\cb3 \ \cb1 I let go of what no longer serves me\cb3 \ \cb1 I am an embodiment of love and truth\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I am at peace with the present\cb3 \ \cb1 I opened myself up to new opportunities\cb3 \ \cb1 I am free of negative energy\cb3 \ \cb1 positivity flows through me with ease\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 I am supported by the universe\cb3 \ \cb1

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to see\cb3 \ \cb1 your well-being and immune system strengthening as you drift off to sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 my name is Jason Stevenson and over the next short while I will guide you into a\cb3 \ \cb1 greater sense of peace health and well-being through mindful awareness and\cb3 \ \cb1 the power of visualization to settle\cb3 \ \cb1 into this practice let yourself find a comfortable lying down position\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] whether on your back or on your side\cb3 \ \cb1 ensure that the spine is straight and your heart space is as open as is\cb3 \ \cb1 comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 let your arms and legs soften into the surface beneath you and if you haven't\cb3 \ \cb1 already done so just closing your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 just taking a moment here to feel into the bed or other surface that supports\cb3 \ \cb1 you and feeling a sense of gratitude for the comforts that you are provided with\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as remaining closed consider the roof\cb3 \ \cb1 over your head and the open air that\cb3 \ \cb1 surrounds you now visualize this open\cb3 \ \cb1 air as it becomes the breath entering into your nostrils as you inhale and\cb3 \ \cb1 being released from your body with each exhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 as you breathe mindfully let yourself soften further into the earth beneath\cb3 \ \cb1 you letting all unconscious and unnecessary tension begin to unravel\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as your body melts into a deeper state of relaxation the presence of stress\cb3 \ \cb1 hormones begin to decline and the immune system begins to strengthen naturally\cb3 \ \cb1 reflecting the symbiotic relationship between mind and body our physical\cb3 \ \cb1 well-being improves as we consciously and compassionately invite the mind into\cb3 \ \cb1 this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 so take a few more moments now to witness the breath as it flows through\cb3 \ \cb1 you and with each exhalation let your\cb3 \ \cb1 bodies surrender more completely\cb3 \ \cb1 you might witness and soften the muscles around your eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 your jaw and tongue your shoulders and\cb3 \ \cb1 arms and your belly\cb3 \ \cb1 or any other part of you that feels tense in the same way that relaxing the\cb3 \ \cb1 mind promotes physical well-being relaxing the physical body encourages\cb3 \ \cb1 ease and release of the mind\cb3 \ \cb1 in a minute or two we will begin a visual journey of immune system\cb3 \ \cb1 strengthening but for now let's just take a few more moments to deepen the\cb3 \ \cb1 body's relaxation response first allow\cb3 \ \cb1 all the air in your lungs gently to be released to the atmosphere around you\cb3 \ \cb1 and together let's just take a deep full breath into the bottom of the belly and\cb3 \ \cb1 then slowly let it back out another long\cb3 \ \cb1 deep breath in and when you're ready let it back out\cb3 \ \cb1 one more full belly reaching breath now making it even longer this time and once\cb3 \ \cb1 you've reached the top slowly release all the air back out to the world around you let your breath come back to its\cb3 \ \cb1 natural rhythm now as you mindfully observe it for just a few more moments on your own\cb3 \ \cb1 now as we slowly transition into our visualization take a moment to draw your\cb3 \ \cb1 attention to the space before your closed eyes\cb3 \ \cb1 though the mind might conjure up images and ideas when left unchecked an open\cb3 \ \cb1 space of unlimited creative potential exists before the mind's eye when we\cb3 \ \cb1 slow down quiet down and tune in and it\cb3 \ \cb1 is upon this canvas now that I invite you to imagine yourself seated on a\cb3 \ \cb1 treehouse balcony overlooking a radiant singing rain forests of Central America\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the Sun glistens in the sky casting its\cb3 \ \cb1 light upon the treetops above you the\cb3 \ \cb1 air is warm and humid earthy and pure you take a long deep breath in and out\cb3 \ \cb1 feeling a strong but subtle wave of gratitude washed through you from where\cb3 \ \cb1 you sit or you can see is the untouched rainforest a sea of green spreading in\cb3 \ \cb1 every direction your gaze turns towards an intuitive understanding of the\cb3 \ \cb1 vitality and health of this rainforest rises to your awareness inspiring you to\cb3 \ \cb1 venture through this ecosystem to experience its restorative and healing\cb3 \ \cb1 potential and yet you take a moment now to notice\cb3 \ \cb1 how you feel in this very moment in these moments before heading on your way\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps you feel tired perhaps you feel well or unwell perhaps you feel what you\cb3 \ \cb1 would call normal or average maybe numbness or discomfort\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever is the case view now ear on your perch above the rainforest simply\cb3 \ \cb1 notice it without attaching yourself to the feelings and sensations moving\cb3 \ \cb1 through you just notice what is here [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 if there is any discomfort tension or\cb3 \ \cb1 unease send those sensations your love\cb3 \ \cb1 your care and your patience as you prepare for a journey into greater\cb3 \ \cb1 health vitality and immunity\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 now you've heard that somewhere not far from the tree house lives a wise healer\cb3 \ \cb1 a mystical woman who knows all about the healing elements and herbs of this\cb3 \ \cb1 rainforest and who may be able to grant you with the greatest sense of health\cb3 \ \cb1 and well-being and so trusting your intuition to guide\cb3 \ \cb1 you in the right direction you pack a backpack with all the essentials you'll\cb3 \ \cb1 need for the day and then you begin your\cb3 \ \cb1 journey you start by climbing down from your treehouse rung by rung gently\cb3 \ \cb1 making your way onto the earth\cb3 \ \cb1 feet firmly rooted in the soil beneath you you take a moment to mindfully\cb3 \ \cb1 inhale the fresh nourishing rainforest air once again and as you exhale you\cb3 \ \cb1 take your first step down the foot path that leads you to the main road\cb3 \ \cb1 not far from your private perch in those natural lands the main road is humble\cb3 \ \cb1 and unpaved just a few metres wide it\cb3 \ \cb1 weaves its way quietly through the rainforest [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 mindful step-by-step you make your way\cb3 \ \cb1 down it in the direction your heart guide you as you walk you note the\cb3 \ \cb1 silence between the forest symphony the air is both quiet and lively modest and\cb3 \ \cb1 confident\cb3 \ \cb1 birds call to you from the overarching canopy as does the breeze the cicadas\cb3 \ \cb1 and the howler monkeys the orchestra\cb3 \ \cb1 awakens you softening the rational and analytical mind as it guides you deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 into the beauty and mystery of the world\cb3 \ \cb1 you continued on for a short while until a path appears on your right-hand side\cb3 \ \cb1 as if silently calling you towards it you are drawn in its direction\cb3 \ \cb1 and so deciding to venture off the main road you take a leap of faith as you\cb3 \ \cb1 make your way down this narrow footpath into the unknown\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as you meander seemingly aimlessly you\cb3 \ \cb1 note that your body begins to shift shoulders begin to soften\cb3 \ \cb1 releasing knots of tension they have held onto for quiet some time now\cb3 \ \cb1 your belly begins to relax expanding and\cb3 \ \cb1 softening with each full deep breath\cb3 \ \cb1 your eyes begin to widen taking in more\cb3 \ \cb1 of the surroundings than they are accustomed to absorbing\cb3 \ \cb1 and your jaw begins to unclench sinking\cb3 \ \cb1 into greater comfort and ease\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] your feet tread lightly as if kissing\cb3 \ \cb1 the earth and you sense yourself coming into greater alignment with the natural\cb3 \ \cb1 world\cb3 \ \cb1 you continue on for some time taking in the surroundings through open eyes is\cb3 \ \cb1 mind and heart great big beautiful\cb3 \ \cb1 flowers in magenta tangerine and lilac\cb3 \ \cb1 tones break up the pervading greenery of the forest meanwhile your ears continue\cb3 \ \cb1 to absorb the sounds of the nearby creatures frogs now chiming in alongside\cb3 \ \cb1 the cicadas birds and monkeys\cb3 \ \cb1 your expanded state of mind takes in the wonder of this incredible vibrant space\cb3 \ \cb1 reflecting upon how healing these natural ecosystems are\cb3 \ \cb1 how can it be you wonder that we have yet to truly learn from the\cb3 \ \cb1 wisdom of these natural ecosystems\cb3 \ \cb1 and then your heart fully expanded now\cb3 \ \cb1 takes in the love and beauty of this rainforest you feel an immense wave of\cb3 \ \cb1 gratitude wash through this loving energy center and so you silently offer\cb3 \ \cb1 a word of thanks to the natural lands you move across you thank them for\cb3 \ \cb1 providing you with just the sort of healing you had yearned for\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you continued on a little while further until another path comes into view this\cb3 \ \cb1 time is on your left-hand side and is even narrower than the one you are on\cb3 \ \cb1 your intuition tells you it is the path to take and so you turn down with\cb3 \ \cb1 confidence and curiosity\cb3 \ \cb1 the path weaves in and out of the tropical trees bringing you into even a\cb3 \ \cb1 closer contact with its wonder the broad\cb3 \ \cb1 leaves are close enough that they nearly brush your cheeks leaving you for a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment to question if you are going the right way and yet just as you begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 doubt the path you've chosen something opens up to you it is a small clearing\cb3 \ \cb1 in the forest in the center of it an elderly woman\cb3 \ \cb1 stands gazing up at the branches of the surrounding trees she's dressed in a\cb3 \ \cb1 long burnt orange dress and is wrapped in a loosely knit Shore the silver\cb3 \ \cb1 braided hair is wrapped in front of her left shoulder and as she stands there it\cb3 \ \cb1 seems as if she is whispering to the trees and then listening\cb3 \ \cb1 and whispering\cb3 \ \cb1 and then listening [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you cough quietly to let her know you were here completely unstart 'old by your presence\cb3 \ \cb1 she turns to you slowly and welcomes you with a warm smile you make your way\cb3 \ \cb1 towards her and she invites you to sit down on a long bench in the center of\cb3 \ \cb1 the clearing she sits next to you and asks what brings you here you begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 tell her that what you longed for is a greater sense of health and well-being\cb3 \ \cb1 particularly in the area of immunity you yearn for a system that is strong and\cb3 \ \cb1 resilient and you believe that perhaps this rainforest might hold what you need\cb3 \ \cb1 she embraces every word you speak and lets you know that it is possible to\cb3 \ \cb1 invite greater balance into your body through any and all acts of self-care\cb3 \ \cb1 including through the words and images you hold in your mind she invites you to\cb3 \ \cb1 begin by taking a dip in the healing blue lagoon just a short walk from her\cb3 \ \cb1 sacred circle and upon your return she\cb3 \ \cb1 will have concocted an herbal tea that will heal and balance your body and\cb3 \ \cb1 enhance its immunity\cb3 \ \cb1 you take her advice and follow the pathway she points you towards\cb3 \ \cb1 veering down a small hill and around a few more bends in the path you soon\cb3 \ \cb1 arrived at a break in the treeline we're turquoise waters reflect back at\cb3 \ \cb1 you from a short distance a small set of\cb3 \ \cb1 stairs guide you down towards the water's edge\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you step off the final stair you\cb3 \ \cb1 take a moment to absorb the fullness of this landscape you have never seen water\cb3 \ \cb1 so bright so clear so radiant\cb3 \ \cb1 after preparing to head into these cool and cleansing waters you inch your way\cb3 \ \cb1 slowly into the lagoon the water moves\cb3 \ \cb1 gently up your body until soon it has\cb3 \ \cb1 reached your waist\cb3 \ \cb1 you went to the water to as comfortable as you possibly can\cb3 \ \cb1 and if you choose to dunking your head under the water and up again\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] the Sun is still high in the sky beaming\cb3 \ \cb1 down on you from its steady place there [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you close your eyes and surrender to the lagoon knowing that it will support you\cb3 \ \cb1 you take a full deep breath in and as\cb3 \ \cb1 you exhale you envision all heaviness or constriction and all imbalances leaving\cb3 \ \cb1 your body you take another full breath in and\cb3 \ \cb1 exhaling once again you envision yourself releasing all the thoughts all\cb3 \ \cb1 the ideas and all the physical imbalances that inhibit you from\cb3 \ \cb1 experiencing radiant health\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] and now that space has been created within you for the new you consciously\cb3 \ \cb1 let your next inhalation fill you with the sun's healing energy it enters your\cb3 \ \cb1 lungs is a warm golden glow cleansing this part of the body's defense system\cb3 \ \cb1 completely\cb3 \ \cb1 then as the sun's golden light seeps further into your body it cleanses and\cb3 \ \cb1 brings balance to your lymphatic system your spleen your thymus your white blood\cb3 \ \cb1 cells and all other parts of your body's\cb3 \ \cb1 immune system\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as it spreads through you from within it\cb3 \ \cb1 continues to penetrate you from the outside as the Sun continues to beat\cb3 \ \cb1 down on your bare skin\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you spend a few more moments here soaking up the healing energy of the Sun\cb3 \ \cb1 off the breath and of the water you rest in knowing that only when all systems\cb3 \ \cb1 and elements are healthy can we experience true health and vitality\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 when you were ready you slowly make your way back towards the shore drying\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself off with the towel and preparing to head back your entire body\cb3 \ \cb1 feels light and free full to the brim with energy and vitality\cb3 \ \cb1 you take the small pathway back to where you encountered the wise woman before she awaits your return with a fresh cup\cb3 \ \cb1 of a hot herbal tea\cb3 \ \cb1 the two of you hold silence as you bow your head and accept the mug she extends\cb3 \ \cb1 to you and as you let the warm immune-boosting\cb3 \ \cb1 liquid flow through you you trust that you already have and continue to come\cb3 \ \cb1 back into balance to come back to your innate capacity for strength vitality\cb3 \ \cb1 and resilience\cb3 \ \cb1 you pass back the empty mug and thank this woman for the blessings she has\cb3 \ \cb1 bestowed upon you and before you leave\cb3 \ \cb1 she reminds you to make sure that you prioritize your rest in the days and\cb3 \ \cb1 years to come rest of both body and mind she says is\cb3 \ \cb1 one of the most underrated and yet most important factors of a healthy internal\cb3 \ \cb1 defense system you smile thanking her\cb3 \ \cb1 once more and then you slowly head back in the direction of your very own tree\cb3 \ \cb1 house\cb3 \ \cb1 first you navigate your way down the narrow rainforest encroaching pathway\cb3 \ \cb1 towards the wider footpath then you\cb3 \ \cb1 follow this wider path until you arrive at the main road and the main road\cb3 \ \cb1 guides you back to the pathway up to your heart\cb3 \ \cb1 and before you know it you were resting on the hammock that swings on your\cb3 \ \cb1 balcony\cb3 \ \cb1 your entire body rests with ease and yet you can feel the awakened empowered\cb3 \ \cb1 energy that flows through you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] you remember the healing light of the Sun that entered your lungs as you\cb3 \ \cb1 floated in the turquoise lagoon and you\cb3 \ \cb1 sense its presence still within you and visioning yourself glowing from within\cb3 \ \cb1 just a few final moments\cb3 \ \cb1 and for just a few more final moments imagine the golden light of the Sun\cb3 \ \cb1 spreads through your entire being\cb3 \ \cb1 and as you slowly release the image of a healing glow within you also begin to\cb3 \ \cb1 dissolve the imagery of the rainforest [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] coming back to the surface that supports you in this reality whether that be a\cb3 \ \cb1 bed a couch or something else you ground\cb3 \ \cb1 yourself affirmative ly back into this present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 notice the innate flow of your breath now continuing to nourish and cleanse\cb3 \ \cb1 you with each cycle follow its gently\cb3 \ \cb1 rhythm as you slowly let yourself drift\cb3 \ \cb1 into slumber [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 goodnight\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1

\f0\fs22 \cf2 you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 hello this is Sara Raymond and welcome to this meditation to help you increase\cb3 \ \cb1 your confidence and inner strength to prepare you for the day ahead today I\cb3 \ \cb1 will guide you into complete body and mind relaxation that can lead you into a\cb3 \ \cb1 deep sleep if you would like or if you are not ready to sleep you will be deeply relaxed before we get started\cb3 \ \cb1 make sure you are prepared to drift off to sleep when this recording is over if\cb3 \ \cb1 you would like take a moment now to turn\cb3 \ \cb1 off all distractions you can pause this recording if you like if there's\cb3 \ \cb1 anything you need to do to prepare yourself for safe and comfortable\cb3 \ \cb1 night's sleep know that you are safe and\cb3 \ \cb1 supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you choose to do so\cb3 \ \cb1 make yourself as comfortable as you can close your eyes and settle in for a deep\cb3 \ \cb1 productive night's sleep so you'll wake in the morning feeling rejuvenated and\cb3 \ \cb1 confident to start your day\cb3 \ \cb1 somewhere deep inside us all we know there is someone trying to grow to the\cb3 \ \cb1 surface our true self our higher self\cb3 \ \cb1 when we delve into self exploration we can see this person we know what\cb3 \ \cb1 direction we want to go for some of us the missing link is just the confidence\cb3 \ \cb1 to believe in ourselves enough to take action\cb3 \ \cb1 the confidence to live our life in alignment with what is truly important to us\cb3 \ \cb1 the last moments before sleep are so important to us they have a tremendous\cb3 \ \cb1 impact on how we start our next day when we wake up our thoughts pick up where\cb3 \ \cb1 they left off we can use this as an opportunity to give us the best chance\cb3 \ \cb1 to begin our day with a positive attitude and in alignment with our\cb3 \ \cb1 values and intentions this meditation is\cb3 \ \cb1 designed to help you drift off to sleep knowing you are going to have a great day\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] confident to handle all that comes your\cb3 \ \cb1 way with a positive intention take a\cb3 \ \cb1 moment before we begin this relaxation process to set an intention for the day\cb3 \ \cb1 ahead the intention can be anything that\cb3 \ \cb1 resonates with you it may be a specific quality you would like to embody more in\cb3 \ \cb1 your life or an emotion you'd like to cultivate\cb3 \ \cb1 maybe you would like to focus on being mindful and staying in the present moment\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever intention is calling to you is fine\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 once you have set your intention bring your awareness to the natural rhythm of\cb3 \ \cb1 your breath at first simply noticed the sensations\cb3 \ \cb1 that accompany your breath maybe you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel a slightly cool sensation as the air passes through your nostrils\cb3 \ \cb1 maybe you feel a floating sensation as your abdomen and chest rise and fill\cb3 \ \cb1 with breath or a heaviness as the air moves out of\cb3 \ \cb1 your body taking any attention with it\cb3 \ \cb1 maybe the breath brings a warming sensation to the body as it travels along its path\cb3 \ \cb1 whatever you're feeling is perfect simply observe the process\cb3 \ \cb1 begin to count the length of your breath in\cb3 \ \cb1 then as you breathe out invite the exhale to be one count longer than the inhale\cb3 \ \cb1 allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress or\cb3 \ \cb1 tension\cb3 \ \cb1 by exhaling just a little longer than you inhale your breath will slow your\cb3 \ \cb1 body and mind will calm down in response\cb3 \ \cb1 breathe in this way for a few more cycles then allow your breath to return\cb3 \ \cb1 to its natural rhythm [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 in a moment I will guide you through a full slow body scan to take you deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 down into relaxation your body knows how to relax and\cb3 \ \cb1 sometimes a simple invitation to do so is all that it takes to release any tension pain or areas of gripping\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 imagine that you can send your breath to any area in your body and the breath\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxes that area and make space for the energy to flow freely\cb3 \ \cb1 now as we begin to scan the body bring your attention first to the top of your\cb3 \ \cb1 head can you feel this area from the\cb3 \ \cb1 inside of your body as sensations only\cb3 \ \cb1 without moving your eyes as you scan the body simply move your awareness to each\cb3 \ \cb1 part and relax that part completely\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] as you move your attention throughout\cb3 \ \cb1 the body you will scan for any areas of tension tightness or pain and if you\cb3 \ \cb1 find areas of tension stay on that part for a moment\cb3 \ \cb1 and send your breath into that area to soften it invite the breath to wash over\cb3 \ \cb1 any part wash away any tension like a way of moving over your body\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] do not attach to the feelings of your\cb3 \ \cb1 body simply accept them as they are in this moment and ask your body to relax\cb3 \ \cb1 and release [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 as you continue scanning your body you will feel this relaxing wave-like energy\cb3 \ \cb1 move through your entire body and it takes you deeper and deeper into a safe\cb3 \ \cb1 and supported state of sleep where you can build your confidence to live as\cb3 \ \cb1 your highest self [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and now move your attention from the top of your head down to your forehead and\cb3 \ \cb1 feel a sense of softening and smoothing\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] continue to relax even deeper around the\cb3 \ \cb1 area of your eyebrows and eyes as you\cb3 \ \cb1 feel the tension from this area melt away your entire body softens a little\cb3 \ \cb1 further [Music] feel your eyelids becoming very heavy\cb3 \ \cb1 allow your cheeks to lengthen down and let go part your teeth unclench your jaw\cb3 \ \cb1 and relax your tongue\cb3 \ \cb1 the softening of your face and jaw will deepen the relaxation of your entire\cb3 \ \cb1 body [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you can now feel your throat softening\cb3 \ \cb1 notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper\cb3 \ \cb1 and deeper allowing this wave of comfort\cb3 \ \cb1 to continue its journey down your body you feel your chest and shoulders\cb3 \ \cb1 release and rest heavy\cb3 \ \cb1 every breath in oxygenate the body to promote healing and recovery from your\cb3 \ \cb1 day\cb3 \ \cb1 now allow the front and back of both arms to relax imagine water droplets\cb3 \ \cb1 flowing from your shoulders down your arms and out of your fingertips taking\cb3 \ \cb1 away all of the stress and tension that your body carries since the relaxing of\cb3 \ \cb1 the abdomen as it sinks down into the surface below you\cb3 \ \cb1 and now inviting the relaxation to continue its path down your body into\cb3 \ \cb1 your hips and lower back\cb3 \ \cb1 linger on this area a little longer and ask your body for a sense of ease\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of all of the tension and tightness held in this area\cb3 \ \cb1 feel your body softening as each breath in creates space for an easy flow of\cb3 \ \cb1 energy through your body\cb3 \ \cb1 this comfort moves into both of your legs washing relaxation over your thighs your\cb3 \ \cb1 knees your shins and your calves imagine\cb3 \ \cb1 again the droplets of water flowing out of your legs and feet washing away any\cb3 \ \cb1 remaining tension tightness or pain\cb3 \ \cb1 you feel as it flows out of your body through the bottoms of your feet so that you are completely relaxed throughout\cb3 \ \cb1 your entire body [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 know that your relaxed body will allow for productive recovery while you sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 so you will awake feeling refreshed and rejuvenated and aligned with your\cb3 \ \cb1 intention [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 you are now deeply relaxed and you can begin to use your\cb3 \ \cb1 imagination I will guide you on a\cb3 \ \cb1 journey taking you into a dream state where you can physically remain safe in\cb3 \ \cb1 your bed while your mind will travel to a

[Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 trees must let go of leaves in the fall to have the opportunity\cb3 \ \cb1 for new growth [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 waves in the ocean flow in to the shore and back out again\cb3 \ \cb1 creating a natural ebb and flow\cb3 \ \cb1 many animals must shed their skin or outer layer in order\cb3 \ \cb1 to grow\cb3 \ \cb1 humans have a period of exhalation to make room for the next inhalation\cb3 \ \cb1 consider the times when resistance creates more difficulty\cb3 \ \cb1 for example the spinning wheels of a car in mud the more you try to get out\cb3 \ \cb1 the deeper the wheels dig into the mud\cb3 \ \cb1 can you find any areas where you are holding on\cb3 \ \cb1 and then let go [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 perhaps you may be holding at the area of your stomach\cb3 \ \cb1 can you let go\cb3 \ \cb1 can you open the flow of energy within you\cb3 \ \cb1 continue to connect with relaxation and letting go\cb3 \ \cb1 as deeply as you can\cb3 \ \cb1 practice surrender\cb3 \ \cb1 practice letting go\cb3 \ \cb1 open to the healing energy within\cb3 \ \cb1 are you able to relax even more\cb3 \ \cb1 connect even deeper to yourself\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] listen to your heart surrender to your inner wisdom\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of your body further and further into\cb3 \ \cb1 relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 let go and drift effortlessly into peace\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of any thoughts of worry\cb3 \ \cb1 any thoughts that might be holding you back from experiencing tranquility\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of any thoughts holding you back from sleep\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music] see these thoughts drift off\cb3 \ \cb1 in the wave of relaxation\cb3 \ \cb1 they will be there when you need them in this calm state of your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of worries so that you can sleep peacefully now\cb3 \ \cb1 what you resist persists\cb3 \ \cb1 acknowledge your thoughts with acceptance without the need to follow them into\cb3 \ \cb1 story\cb3 \ \cb1 meet your present experience with\cb3 \ \cb1 permission allow your thoughts to come\cb3 \ \cb1 and go without resistance\cb3 \ \cb1 welcoming a calmness to wash over you [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 completely [Music] let go of anything you might be holding\cb3 \ \cb1 on to from yesterday or earlier today\cb3 \ \cb1 let go of anything that may be taking up space in your mind\cb3 \ \cb1 give yourself permission to be here right now\cb3 \ \cb1 sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission\cb3 \ \cb1 to let go of the past\cb3 \ \cb1 give yourself some space for something new\cb3 \ \cb1 something to grow into\cb3 \ \cb1 [Music]\cb3 \ \cb1 and now
