0 begin by getting in a comfortable seated position spine tall and straight sit bones balanced shoulders rolled away from the ears opening up that beautiful heart of yours letting your palms rest open in your lap and lovingly close your eyes tune into your breath and your body becoming present noticing how it feels as you breathe in and out letting your belly and rib cage expand on every in-breath and contract on every out breath as you tune into the weight of gravity letting the muscles in your face relax letting any muscles you do not need right now become loose with the weight of gravity  then you tune in to you you say to yourself i am here with me now i choose to be my best friend and to offer myself the gift that a growth mindset brings  feel this commitment to yourself in your heart for truly a growth mindset is a commitment it's not a one-time thing  tune into your heart in the middle of your chest and a couple of inches inwards  this is the energy center of your heart and in here lies an eager happy openness to committing to a growth mindset  do you feel that happiness your heart is happy that you are open to committing to a growth mindset for it doesn't just affect your mindset mentally it affects your entire way of being it affects your emotions your physical body and of course your mental wellness as you tune into your heart you become clear why do you desire a growth mindset why do you feel it will serve you who do you wish to become  as you tune in to your desire in your heart to become the best version of you you take a nice deep breath in stomach and ribcage fully expanding holding your breath at the top letting this desire to be the best version of you build and when you're ready exhale with a sigh  you tune in to that desire to grow to be open to feedback to be committed to you and you let that desire flow as you breathe in and out and listen to these words as they spark more desire within you  and start to even turn from desire into action for you feel open and knowing that the more you listen to the following messages the more you will start to shift into a growth mindset keep breathing and listen to these words and let them move you  you are responsible for your thoughts yes the world around you has influenced you in some way but it ultimately is up to you to decide what is true to you you create your reality with the beliefs you have and the beliefs you have are just thoughts you've been thinking over and over  you have the power to think new thoughts every time a thought occurs that you wonder does this serve me if the answer is no you can choose a new thought much like attending to a garden that perhaps has been long overlooked for years and years and there are many weeds and tangled roots it takes time to pull out what's no longer needed in that garden the weeds may keep growing back time and time again but the more you tend to the garden the more you plant the seeds you wish to see in the garden the more your garden becomes that which you desire it to be it takes daily work and daily cultivation the same is true with your mind and when you become the gardener of your mind you become a master at growth mindset because you know you can change the landscape of your mind masterfully you can curate it to be whatever you wish it to be you become open to feedback from others you become non-resistant because you know that everything you see witness here you are the one who ultimately decides whether or not you keep it  whether or not it is part of the garden you wish to  cultivate in the past perhaps you have allowed yourself to feel triggered by someone's words or actions and perhaps you thought that was a bad thing now as the gardener of the landscape in your mind you recognize that any time you feel triggered it's quite similar to stumbling upon a patch of bittersweet in the garden this is an invasive species that can choke out the other plants instead of viewing it as a bad thing you now with your growth mindset simply view it as something to take care of when you focus on what you would rather see and stand you allow yourself to remove that which doesn't serve and you only view that which doesn't serve as guidance versus a bad thing you are the gardener of the landscape of your mind continually shaping molding and cultivating beliefs and views that serve you it is a daily commitment feel in your heart how committed you are as you affirm to yourself i cultivate the landscape of my mind i choose a growth mindset every time i am faced with anything i view as an obstacle or bad i choose to curate thoughts and beliefs that serve me  i'm open to growth and commitment to growth now take a nice big deep breath in stomach and rib cage fully expanding holding your breath at the top and when you're ready exhale with a sigh  take this feeling and commitment with you as you begin to roll your shoulders wiggle your fingers and toes and when you're ready slowly open your eyes back to the world around you  now go out there as the gardener of your inner landscape of your mind and enjoy cultivating the thoughts and beliefs you wish to see you
0 Learn New Skills | Guided Meditation To Learn Faster A New Skill Learning something new represents a challenge as we know we will be forced to leave our comfort zone. Sometimes we pass on learning something new because we fear we couldn't “get it right”; it’s just too hard or will take too much time. However, there are times when learning something new is easy and exciting in the beginning, but as we dive deeper into the skill, frustrations may emerge. The frustration barrier doesn’t just make learning more difficult; it is also demotivating. When you face the barrier repeatedly, you may start to believe that you are not born with the talents necessary to succeed in the particular skill you are trying to learn. Whether it be learning how to code, drawing, play a new sport or business, there’s no skill that you can’t acquire. In this meditation, we will grow your mental capacity to learn faster, memorize more, and keep yourself motivated. It is recommended to do this meditation every time before practice your new desired skill to maximize your learning potential. Let's begin Find a quiet place where you can lay down or sit in a comfortable position without being disturbed. Allow your eyelids to close over your eyes softly. Slowly take a deep breath in...hold for a moment and slowly let the breath all the way out. Take a few more deep breaths. Gently all the way in - pause and slowly, all the way out. On every exhale, your body relaxes more and more. As you focus on my voice, your mind calms down and opens to the positive suggestions of becoming very good at a desired new skill. Now, I would like you to call to mind a skill you already have and are good at. It can be driving a car or a bicycle. Maybe, cooking, work, or business-related. Anything that comes to your mind. In your mind's eye, visualize yourself practicing this skill. Take a few moments to enjoy it. How does it feel doing something that you are good at? Remember the time when you learned that skill. When was it? How did you learn it? Was it easy or hard? Take notes on how you feel knowing that you pass a long way to learn that skill, and you are here, now enjoying it. Proud of it. Now, I would like you to call to mind the skill you want to develop. It could be one that you find particularly challenging. It could be a skill that you have been trying to acquire for some time. Take a moment and visualize yourself practicing this skill. Zoom-in on the details. What do you feel? If you sense any frustration or anxiety emerging, take a deep inhale, and as you exhale, let it go. Now, I would like you to find a connection between your desired skill and the one you already acquire. The connection does not have to be a direct one. Take a moment to find a connection, small or big. As your mind bridges the gap between the two skills, visualize yourself practicing the new desired skill with the same confidence and pleasure you practice the skill you already possess. See yourself improving and getting better and better. It’s becoming too easy. This skill cannot be taken away. This skill is a part of you. Notice all there is to notice, from your breath to your posture and how you feel. Allow yourself to relish in this moment of victory. You may sense the corners of your mouth curl up into a smile. You may even jump up in celebration in your mind's eye. And as you celebrate getting good at your new skill, repeat the following affirmation in your mind. My brain can easily contain a lot of information. I can learn anything I choose to. I’m finding learning new things easy and fun. I believe in myself and my abilities. I have a great memory. My desire to learn new things increases daily. I am always motivated to learn new things. I am a naturally smart and intelligent person. I have full confidence in my learning abilities. Let yourself feel a sense of fulfillment. Take a moment to thank yourself for showing up to your practice and taking the time to develop a skill that you truly desire. Stay in this sense of gratitude for a few more moments, the gratitude for learning a new skill, your ability, and your mindset. When you are ready, slowly come back to your physical body. Wiggle the fingers and toes. At your own pace, open the eyes.

0 Awaken Your Intuition |10 Minute Guided Meditation To Enhance Your Inner Voice Your intuition is the heart of your soul. It connects you to a higher intelligence that protects you and guides you. It knows everything you want in this lifetime. And, it knows how to get you there. All you need to do is quiet the mind, ask a question, and listen to your heart. This meditation will guide you to tap into your intuition’s infinite wisdom and transform your life in a magical way. Begin by finding a comfortable position sitting or laying down. When you are ready, gently close your eyes and let out a deep breath. Exhale all that you have been carrying around with you throughout the day. This is a new moment. Leave everything else in the past and bring your awareness to this moment. As you inhale through the nose, slowly follow your breath as it travels from your nostrils, down your throat, and into your lungs. Feel the air expand and fill up your entire chest. And as you exhale, focus on the steady stream of air that comes from out of your body. Keep focusing on your breathe a few more moments, and let your body fully relax. Anytime you notice your thoughts wandering off, bring yourself back to the present moment by focusing on your breathing. You are safe here. Surrender to this moment. Now, we are going deeper into relaxation. Bring your attention to your feet. Imagine warm energy slowly pouring over your feet and going up to your legs. Feel how all the tension is leaving your feet and legs. Visualize the energy going up to your torso. Feel your lower body getting heavier and heavier. As the energy goes up, it relaxes your stomach, chest, shoulders, arms, neck. Imagine this energy like a blanket that melts and hugs your entire body. Feel your body as it’s pulled by gravity, sinking deeper into the surface beneath you. Feel the energy going up and loosen all your face muscles. Allow this relaxing feeling to release all the tension from your body. From this place of full relaxation, shift your attention to the space between your eyebrows. This is your third eye chakra. It is the place where your soul meets your physical body. It also provides the wisdom necessary to access truth beyond time and space. Imagine a single point of purple energy penetrating the space between your eyebrows. Visualize the purply energy going deeper into your skull. Extend that energy outwards as well, and imagine the purple light beaming out of your third eye. Feel the tingling sensation as you bring focused attention to this area. You may also feel a buzz of powerful energy all around your forehead. Go deeper into the sensation as you connect to your intuition center. Now, think about an area of your life that you would like guidance or clarity on and form a question that could shed light on it. Ask for the answer to be revealed to you. Be open to any information you receive. Notice any thoughts that arise. Avoid censoring your thoughts or processing them with your rational mind. Just observe what comes up without overthinking about it. Even if things don’t seem to make sense or the answers feel incomplete, just note everything that comes up without judgment. If it feels right to do so, ask additional questions, one at a time. But, do not force the answers. If you still feel that you need more information, let it come to you. Know that your intuition will communicate to you in perfect timing. Your intuition has heard you, and the answers will come. With this understanding, relax your mind and focus on the space between your eyebrows once again. Take three deep breaths. With each inhale, breathe in light. With each exhale, breathe out worry and fear. Repeat these affirmations either out loud or in your head: I trust myself and the voice that speaks within me. All that I need to know at this moment is revealed to me. I am always in the right place at the right time. My intuition effortlessly guides me. My intuition guides me to everything that is meant for me. I am wise, intuitive, and connected to my inner guidance. I am one with the highest intelligence that guides my soul. Take one last deep breath and wiggle your fingers and toes to bring awareness back to your body. Shake your arms and legs gently. Gently open your eyes and bring your awareness back to your surroundings.

0 Welcome to SoothingPod’s meditation. In today’s meditation, we will be exploring  what it means to be creative, as well as how we   can better express ourselves with courage. And,  what does it take to colour outside the lines? Before we dive into this exploration,  take a moment to tune into this present   moment by bringing yourself to  a comfortable seated position. Gently elongate the spine, neck included,   and then allow your arms to rise up  overhead for a momentary stretch… … and then release them back down to rest  on the thighs, the knees, or in your lap. Draw your attention now to the breath,   mindfully watching the path it takes from the  outer world to the inner… and then back out again. Notice your breaths current rhythm and depth   as you begin to settle more comfortably into  this space. With every mindful breath we take,   the racing mind softens and we become more  receptive to whatever is here right now. Continuing to breathe mindfully,  expand your awareness to include   any other sensations you might be experiencing. Perhaps you notice a tingling sensation…  a tightness… a softening… or an expansion. Whatever is the case for you right now, simply  witness each sensation without any judgment,   inviting the breath deep into any areas  of tension if discomfort is present. Inhale a sense of nourishment and inspiration… … and exhale all tension, all fear, and  any discomfort that might be present.   If you feel completely at  ease in this moment already,   simply continue to watch the breath move  through you, cleansing you as it does so. Take just a few more breaths in silence, releasing  any rising thoughts with each exhalation. Creativity is often believed to be something  exclusive to people such as painters, poets,   and playwrights. And while these people do  tend to embody a high degree of creativity,   the essence of creativity is  something much broader than this. Creativity is the use of imagination or  inventiveness to create something new and   original, and by this definition, creativity is  something that all of us embody. Whether on paper   or canvas, or in our homes and relationships,  creativity expresses itself in numerous ways. In the words of writer Elizabeth Gilbert,  “If you’re alive, you’re a creative person.” Creativity is required to navigate  complicated relationships,   just as much as it’s needed to  compose a great piece of music.   Of course these are very different examples of  the use of creativity, but at the core of them,   they require the same things: courage, confidence,  and a willingness to step beyond the familiar. To be creative, we need to be willing to make  mistakes – to be willing to colour outside of   the lines. Through mistakes, we learn.  Through colouring beyond our boundaries,   we discover we are capable of far  more than we had previously imagined. So, take a moment now to return to your breath,   silently inviting your innate capacity  for creativity to rise to the surface. Now, silently repeat the words: My imagination has no bounds. I honour my unique expression of creativity. I am willing to draw outside of the lines. Continuing to breathe slowly and steadily,  with these affirmations lingering in mind,   notice how it feels to honour the  creative energy within your being. And, if the mind intervenes to  deny your embodiment of creativity,   gently invite these self-limiting beliefs  into the heart for healing and release. When it comes to creativity, it is not possible to  compare ourselves to any standards we might hold.   Our creative energy and potential is  unique to who we are as individuals. Take another deep breath in, all  the way to the base of the belly…  And as you exhale, release any fears,   any limitations, or any standards you might  hold for yourself in relation to creativity. Gently allow the heart space to  open wider on your next inhalation,   inviting your courage and confidence  to rise alongside your creativity. Take just a few more slow and steady breaths now,  silently honouring your unique creative potential. Observe the natural ebb and flow of one more   breath… … and then shift your attention back  to your physical presence in this room. When you are ready, gently open your eyes.  I hope you enjoyed today’s  meditation. See you again.  English (United States)       
0 if it's comfortable for you let's begin by taking a gentle deep breath in through the nose and out through the mouth and with that exhalation adopting a comfortable posture of awareness returning the breath to its natural rhythm and allowing your attention to gently drop into this present moment and without turning or looking around just lightly bringing into your awareness all that's in your surrounding space and with your next out breath allowing your focus to fall onto one specific object that's in your field of vision and it's not an intense stare so just maintaining it as a very soft focus and this is a gentle practice so if at any point the eyes become fatigued allowing yourself to gently close them for a moment or two and then reopening them nice and easy noticing as any thoughts come and go and just returning the attention back to your object and now letting the focus zoom back out again being aware of your surroundings perhaps blinking a few times allowing this cultivated focus to follow you into your next activity  you
0 Welcome to Soothing Pod’s meditation.  In this session, we’ll explore the   ways our meditation practice can help us  better enjoy who we are and what we do.   Begin by finding a quiet place to sit.   Gently close your eyes, and  let your spine lengthen.   As you sit up tall, release any unnecessary  tension so that you stay alert yet relaxed.   And as you start to settle  in, take a few deep breaths.   As you exhale, let go of any  expectations you have for your practice.   Let go of commitments for the rest of your day.   And set aside whatever you  don’t need at this moment.   Now, turn towards your breath.   Soft, smooth inhales and exhales.   There’s no need to shape or control your  breath. Instead, notice its natural flow.   Observe your breath’s length.  Notice its depth… its temperature.   Just let your breath be as it is, and stay  present from the start of each inhalation   to the end of each exhalation.   As you breathe in, watch the breath moving  through your nostrils... your ribs expanding...   your belly rising. As you breathe out,  follow the movement of your belly releasing,   your ribs gently contracting, and your  breath moving out of your nostrils again.   Stay with the whole cycle of your breath,  noticing your whole body breathing with you.   And now, invoke a sense of  appreciation for your breath.   As you observe each cycle, enjoy the wave of  your breath. Notice the freshness of each inhale.   The soft ease of the exhales.   And when your mind inevitably wanders,   drop any judgments or labels, and bring your  attention back to your breath once more.   Tap into the ebb and flow of your  breath with kindness and appreciation.   Now, allow your awareness to soften.   Have you ever stopped to ask yourself  if you like the person that you are   and the life that you’ve created? Regardless of  what your life looks like, it can be exhausting   to live in a world where we don’t like who we are  or what we do. And no matter how hard we work or   how many goals we manage to reach, we’ll never  feel truly content until we learn to accept,   to like, and eventually to love who we are. Liking  ourselves isn’t about landing our ideal job,   living in our dream house, or having the  perfect family. It’s about learning to hold   ourselves with love and respect, celebrating  our strengths, and honoring our weaknesses.   Meditation is a powerful tool which helps us step  more fully into our authentic selves, and learn to   appreciate our unique gifts and qualities. Every  time we make room for our breath, just as it is,   we are developing self-acceptance. And when we  turn towards our experience with appreciation   and kindness, we are building our capacity  to honor and celebrate ourselves. It is   from this place that we also learn  to appreciate and value who we are,   how we speak and act, and how we move  through our days. As Maya Angelou once said:   “Success is liking yourself, liking  what you do, and liking how you do it.”   Now, slowly come back to your breath and send  a wave of appreciation into your whole body.   When you’re ready, wiggle your fingers  and toes. And let your eyes softly open.   Enjoy the rest of your day, and  we’ll see you back here soon.  English (United States)

0 welcome to a guided meditation for focus for studying on the clutter of the mind let's start the practice by finding a comfortable seat you can practice this meditation right where you're planning to study so it can be on a computer chair or seat in the library or in the bedroom or in the office and just ensure you're sitting with your back upright but comfortable and resting your hands in your lap let's start with our eyes open and taking in a few big deep breaths breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth and now if you're doing this meditation in public such as in a library or school  you can keep your eyes opened for the practice just maintain a soft gaze looking downwards otherwise you can close your eyes here and allow your breath to return to a comfortable pace and let's start by reflecting on the reality of our distraction-filled world there's so many things competing for our attention but we ultimately have in us the ability to maintain control over our minds and our attention so let's start by setting an intention for this practice in your mind repeat the following may i have a focused and energized meditation session and now let's turn our attention to the breath most of us don't notice that we are breathing all day long we simply forget that we are breathing we're so caught up in our days and thoughts it just sits there in the background without us noticing so let's bring our attention to the breath and notice the sensations around breathing and you don't need to change the breath here just allow the body to breathe on its own and notice it watch the rising and falling sensations around the body with each inhale and exhale and when you inhale naturally picture yourself breathing all the way down into your toes feel as though the air travels all the way into each one of your toes on each in-breath and notice as you do this as you watch the breath and maintain this visual thoughts and feelings may arise and attempt to pull your attention away from the breath just like distractions in the world that attempt to pull your attention away while you study but we can notice distractions just like we notice the breath and when a distraction arises we don't need to engage with it or follow it with more thinking simply allow the distraction to come and go through the mind and then return your attention back to the breath and now imagine that when you inhale you are breathing all the way into each fingertip imagine the feeling in your hands as the breath extends all the way into each fingertip and again if you find that the mind has become distracted or lost in thought if it's planning or thinking about what you'll be doing after the practice don't become frustrated or attach more thoughts to these thoughts simply notice it as a distraction allow the thought to dissipate and then return your attention to the breath and now i want you to bring your attention to how you are feeling right now notice how focused or unfocused you are in this moment there's no judgment needed just be with whatever you notice and when it's time to focus and study all we need to do is calm the mind and ground our attention our goal is to keep our mind with the task at hand and let it enter a flow state on its own we just need to create the internal conditions to allow that to happen but this also means creating the right conditions in our external world so this practice focused on our internal worlds but outside we need to mute our phones close out all other tabs use tools that allow us to block social media and news sites create the conditions both internally and externally for a successful study session and now let's close out the practice by setting an intention for our studying session and for the rest of our day so in your mind repeat may i have a focused and productive study session may i be undistracted and concentrated may i be committed to my studies may i focus effortlessly and now open your eyes you've just completed the practice for studying thanks for sitting and may you have a focused and productive day you  English (auto-generated)

0 you welcome to this guided meditation focusing on being open to change for growth and uncovering your values find a position you can be comfortable in turn off all distractions and settle in for the next 20 minutes or so close your eyes and begin to bring your awareness to your breath without changing your breath without any judgments or expectations of what it should or shouldn't be notice how your breath flows in through your nose and fills up your body with life as it flows out each exhale takes with it any physical and emotional tension as if that tension just melts away from your body to be gone forever as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer then allow the thoughts to pass by you can say in your mind thinking and allow that thought to move on and return your attention to your breath and to the sound of my voice as your guide on this journey of relaxation and discovery now as you begin to deepen each breath in and out notice the stillness that comes between each inhale and exhale as your breath deepens focus your attention on the stillness between the breaths take another deep slow breath in making your deepest breath yet fill your lungs completely and then release the breath through your mouth like a sigh empty your lungs completely and feel all the tension in your body loosen then inviting your breath to return to a natural rhythm allow each breath to deepen your level of relaxation give yourself permission to be fully supported by the surface below you to turn off all distractions and to be open to the possibilities of what comes with a state of comfort as you move deeper into this meditation approach it with the intention of letting go of expectations letting go of comparisons and just discover what comes up without any judgement and now turn your attention to the top of your head and imagine there is a warm light surrounding you and protecting you visualize this light see the lights color see the glowing nature of the soft warm light and as this light passes over your body it progressively relaxes you and releases each muscle small and large from your head all the way down to your toes so you begin to feel your forehead soften and smooth your eyebrows and eyes melt the tiny muscles around your eyes release you feel your eyelids becoming very heavy your cheeks lengthen down on the sides of your face you part your teeth unclench your jaw and relax your tongue you feel your throat softening and as the muscles around your eyes let go and the jaw releases the rest of the body knows what to do and will respond by letting go of any held tension as well you see and feel the warm glowing light moving downwards continuing this progressive relaxation like a wave washing over you feel the tension melting out of your shoulders moving down your arms so that the tension flows out of your body through your fingertips feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and connected to the Earth's energy as you allow it to let go this connection of energy will support you on your journey of self-discovery today with each breath your chest and abdomen begin to feel heavy and you are fully supported by your surroundings and protected by this glowing calming light as it continues the relaxation process and notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper this light continues to move down your body releasing the tension from your lower back and hips your thighs and pelvis feel very heavy and sink down into the surface below you your knee is softened and your calves melt as your body continues to rest heavy your ankles and feet let go of any remaining tension that your body may still feel to be completely relaxed safe and supported now take one more moment to scan your body for any residual tightness pain or tension and then breathe into that area so that you can completely let go and surrender to the heaviness of gravity and now your whole body is heavy on the earth strongly connected and rooted into the Earth's energy we are all connected in this world every living thing there are no gaps between us we are exchanging molecules with each other constantly with the animals with the trees with the water we are one collective field of energy now that you are deeply relaxed begin to use your imagination and

the breeze you feel yourself walking in the direction of the water slowly moving step by step you get to the sloping bank of the water and look out at the sparkling reflections of the trees and the Sun on the glassy water standing on the bank of the lake you root your feet down and feel the Earth's energy come up through your body taking in this energy into your body it grounds you and centers

this beautiful garden notice the beautiful flowers along each side and you feel more peaceful and comfortable deep snap feeling so contempt and this path leads you to further enlightenment along this path you easily experience spiritual growth however your journey comes to an abrupt end when you suddenly see before you stone rock wall approach the wall that barricades your way as you look around on either side of the mall you see that there's no way around this wall and as you look up at how high the wall is you realize that you have to go past this wall the progress on your journey remaining on the side of the wall limits your personal growth perhaps you can jump over this wall move back just a bit and run a few steps jumping up as high as you can however you cannot reach the top you slide back down and this time you walk back even further and you run harder and jump towards the top of this wall but you still cannot reach the top again you slide back down the wall so now you go back many feet and with a running start you run as hard as you can and jump as high as you can and clench your fingers on the top of the wall soon start scratching your arms hurting your elbows as you fall back upon the ground and suddenly you realize that this wall it's a part of yourself that you've repressed it's a part of you carefully hidden from the world and perhaps even yourself this wall was a block on your journey through life it's a part of yourself and needs to be healed but you must move beyond this wall in order to continue to grow and learn about yourself so one more time we try to go over this wall you start back even further and run harder you jump as high as you can climbing grasping at the wall but you slide down scratching your face and hands hurt your knees and as you stand up and look at yourself you realize that to fight this wall will destroy you so you think what am I gonna do how am I gonna get past this wall this part of myself that needs to be healed if it's important for you to know take a moment now to understand a part of you is causing this block what is the emotion or event that has kept you stuck walk up now and place your hands on the wall you can smell the stones and feel the roughness of the wall you realize again there's no way around this wall and no way to go over or under this wall you have to go through the wall ask yourself I will take

0 hi and welcome to a brain boost here from ezel this is a special brain boost that's designed to be a mantra or guided meditation that you can come back to anytime you're feeling especially challenged at work and you need to cultivate a growth mindset in the face of those challenges positive change is the result of working through the challenges before me flowers are nature's response for plants that needed to attract pollinators leaves were nature's response for plants that needed more energy the challenges that I face are a natural part of life and like a beautiful garden my mind will grow from facing the challenges before me when I'm stretching my abilities I expect to make some mistakes so when these mistakes come I'm going to react by taking a new approach by taking a smaller step towards solving the problem or when the stakes are especially high I'm going to use small experiments to test my ideas before I put them into broader action each time that I try something new I'm planting a seed in the garden of my mind in like a garden my mind grows from each new challenge that I face courage and bravery in the face of my challenges are the fertilizer for the garden of my mind the belief that I will never be able to do something is the ugly weed in the garden of my mind and I'm removing these weeds by smiling in the face of new challenges the garden of my mind is beautiful and ever-growing come back to this video whenever you need it and for a new brain boost every week here on the easel YouTube channel  English (auto-generated)      
0 begin by sitting in a comfortable position make sure you are in a place where you will not be interrupted let your spine grow tall and straight roll your shoulders back slightly to open up your heart place your palms in your lap facing upwards and whenever you're ready lovingly close your eyes begin by allowing all of your awareness to center in on your breath without judging it or trying to change it for now just notice it paying attention to how it feels as it enters and exits your body becoming curious about what muscles you are engaging as you breathe extending your awareness you noticing the feeling of gravity on your body using this awareness to drop into your body in this present moment and now on your next inhale allow your stomach to expand fully as you breathe in deeply rib cage expands and you hold your breath at the top and as it feels right to you exhale with a sigh at the bottom of this breath and just return to breathing at a pace that's comfortable for you stomach expanding as you breathe in and contracting as you breathe out throughout the course of this meditation you begin to see yourself standing on a trail before you the trail splits into five different pathways going from left to right we will number the trails as one through five trail one on your left shows you the version of you in the future that is as if you just stayed exactly the same as you are now you see that version of you smiling and waving at you much yourself become aware of that version this should be easy to do as they are exactly as you are right now you may even see them in the clothes you are wearing in this very moment  regardless of how much you desire change much yourself lovingly wave back at them feeling grateful that they are here  appreciating where you are right now and with that appreciation you allow your awareness to turn to Path number two here you see a version of yourself who has made one small alteration to their life what is this small change that they made perhaps it's a tiny change you've been thinking of doing  how does this change affect their life  how does it affect their appearance their personality or the successes that they have let yourself see this version of you clearly see them smiling and waving at you as you smile and wave back and now on path green the middle path the one directly before you you see a version of you who has made several small changes nothing too big but enough to make a difference on their life what do they look like what changes have they made  perhaps they've achieved goals that you've had in mind for a long time see them smiling and waving at you as you smile and wave back and now on the fourth path you see the version of you that has reached the goals and dreams you currently have notice how they feel and look it's as if you can sense the emotions but they are feeling the accomplishments they've achieved notice how that feels within you see them smiling and waving at you as you smile and wave back  and now as you turn your awareness to the right to path number five you see the version of you that's gone way above and beyond all the changes all the goals that you had in mind their success is way beyond anything you had yet imagined take a moment to see what that looks like what have they done what is their appearance like tune into how they feel and let yourself feel their emotions they smile and wave at you as you smile and wave back and as you look at all five of these versions of you while smiling and waving you know in your heart which path you desire to follow and you happily walk down the path towards the version of you you most desire to be right now see yourself standing before this version of you and as soon as you are face to face all the other paths just melt away it's just you and this desired version of you the person you most want to be look into their eyes  allow your heart to connect to their heart  tune into a confidence in their eyes there's a confidence and a wisdom of knowing who they are tune into your heart as it connects to theirs feel how it feels to be them what accomplishments have they achieved what material objects do they have how fulfilled are they in love and their financial life  and in terms of their physical health feel all of these aspects and imagine your body merging with theirs becoming who they are aligning fully with this desired version of yourself if this is what you desire yourself to be this is who you truly are take a deep breath into the snowing let your stomach fully expand and hold your breath at the top let the feeling of being this version of you build within Europe and as it feels right to you exhale with a sigh this is your birthright everywhere you go throughout the rest of the day remind yourself of this feeling feeling yourself aligned with the truest version of you your most desired version of you who you truly are and who you truly want to be and take this feeling with you everywhere you go as you slowly bring your awareness back to the room around you opening your eyes whenever you are ready  you  English (auto-generated)

0 good morning and welcome to your practice i'm sarah raymond from the mindful movement and i am truly honored you have chosen to allow me to be your guide this meditation is designed to empower you if you are feeling stuck overwhelmed and anxious and if you are motivated for change yet feeling limited by your beliefs today is a new day and a new opportunity to gain clarity in a time of personal growth i invite you to make yourself comfortable choose a relaxed seated posture with your spine upright if possible  perhaps on a cushion on the floor a chair against a wall or on a couch close your eyes if you'd like or simply soften your gaze start to shift side to side gently in your seat feel the movement of your attention from one side to another move this shifting upward to your waist then see if you are able to move the wiggle up to your ribs  and then shoulders then maybe even a small movement side to side at the height of your neck and then your head take a deep breath in through your nose then let out an audible sigh exhale as you settle into stillness become aware of the feels in your body the sensations perhaps you sense a buzzing or tingling as the energy from your movement continues yet your physical body becomes still as if there is a momentum within you that takes a few moments too slow take another few deep breaths at your own pace continuing to settle  inhale through your nose and let out an audible exhale a sigh or ha sound or perhaps make a humming noise on your exhale  noise creates vibration in your throat and it is effective to help you relax and regulate your nervous system  after a few cycles let your breath return to its effortless rhythm invite a softening of your outer layer to wash over you perhaps you might imagine the removal of armor put there to protect you yet here you are safe it is okay to let go of this armor for a bit or consider what it might feel like to blur your edges as if a camera lens is changing focus you are still you you are safe you are simply letting go of the rough hard edges as you continue to relax and soften in your mind visualize a doorway or an entrance of sorts this can be a doorway you have been to before or one that exists only in your mind  this may show up as a memory or as if it is a picture in your mind  if nothing specific comes to mind simply use the idea of a door this door represents your opportunity to grow to move forward to make the change in your life that you desire this is the metaphorical threshold you may be having trouble crossing in your own life perhaps something related to business a relationship your home life a creative endeavor  as this image becomes clearer in your mind you can also see yourself in front of this doorway  as you witness yourself standing in front of the door that you know leads you to the next step in your life you see that you are holding many items in both of your hands it becomes clear that you cannot open this door unless you are willing to put some things down breathe slowly and continue to relax and connect with the feeling that you are safe these items you are holding represent any and all beliefs obstacles or responsibilities that are holding you back knowing that you must let go  in order to open this door consider what needs to be laid down breathe in and exhale letting go letting go letting go as you let go sense the weight being lifted the lightness wash over you consider these questions to help you let go what is no longer serving you  what is standing in your way is there a story you have been telling yourself that is holding you back from the change you desire the answers to these questions may show up for you now or sometime in the future be open be  curious now is the time to let go of anything that may be holding you back from making a change you desire  let go of any negative beliefs you may have about yourself visualize yourself putting down the limiting beliefs so they can no longer hold you back and now consider what is a new belief about yourself that would serve you  better you have put down any negative beliefs or anything holding you back you have freed your hands to be able to open the door now you have made room for new positive powerful beliefs to surface that will support you as you move through this door things may not feel aligned with the life of your dreams right now and that's okay today you begin to move towards what you want  know that all you desire is available to you because you are absolutely good enough you are worthy you deserve love success health financial freedom and all that you desire  hear these words again  feel them in your heart as true you are enough you are worthy you deserve all that you desire  now that you have laid down what is holding you back you can open the door you can move through the threshold into the next phase the next step see yourself moving through the doorway and look back at all that you have laid down perhaps you recognize that now you are open to receive new clear thoughts and ideas about your path  you are open to experience clarity you begin to notice how new ideas begin to present themselves to you and now let the visualization go and bring your awareness back to your felt sensations once more take a moment to ground yourself after this visualization and feel the weight of your body a strong anchoring connection with the surface below you become rooted in this present moment fully allow your breath to create ease in your body and ease in your mind to open to clarity to show itself from within you  as you breathe sense the feeling of clarity breathe in a state of calmness and ease the clarity you desire is within you simply bring your focus inward  cultivate simplicity and focus of the mind to experience clarity may you move through the doorway with ease and experience all that you desire while remaining grounded in presence when you feel ready open your eyes if you feel called to do so you can benefit from taking pen to paper and writing about what came up for you during this practice for your reference as your writing i have included the questions from this meditation in the description box below thank you for practicing with me today i hope you have a wonderful day  English (auto-generated)

0 Welcome to Soothing Pod’s meditation.   In today’s meditation, we will be  exploring the power of vulnerability,   opening the heart lovingly to both  ourselves and to this innate human quality. To begin, bring yourself to a seated  position that is secure and comfortable. Close the eyes and allow   the muscles around them to soften… … and then check in with your posture. Ensure that the neck and the rest  of the spine form one straight line,   and then allow the shoulders to relax. Soften the stomach as you become  more attuned to your breath,   allowing it to flow as deep as is  comfortable for you in this moment. Now, take a moment to tune into any thoughts or  stories that may be trickling through the mind. They may be strong, heavy, and stubborn… … or they may be soft, gentle, and fleeting. Whatever the mind’s contents feel  like in this moment, see if you can   open your heart lovingly to whatever is here… … and then soften as you return to your direct felt experience in this moment. Notice the earth beneath you or the surface  supporting you… and notice any physical   sensations that may be present within. If anything uncomfortable is present, invite a loving, compassionate  breath into each of these areas. Take a few more moments of quiet space  now, just witnessing whatever is here   as you continually re-ground  yourself through the breath. What does it mean to be vulnerable? To be vulnerable is to be raw, honest,   and open; it is to be capable of loss,  hurt, and pain. It is to be fully human. Many of us hide our vulnerabilities, denying  wounds and avoiding failure, because they   hold much shame, guilt, and judgment. In a world  that often fails to go deep (or fears doing so),   vulnerabilities are seen as weakness – and  weakness is seen as something negative. However, if we open ourselves to the  possibility of being truly vulnerable,   we come into contact with its power. Because, despite any misconceptions we might hold about it, vulnerability is where our humanity shines through; and through it, we grow, evolve, and find strength. In the words of Brené Brown, “Vulnerability is the birthplace of  innovation, creativity, and change.” When we allow ourselves to be vulnerable, we  learn more about who we are as individuals   and as humans; understandings that  propel us forward for positive growth. Brown also explains, “Embracing  our vulnerabilities is risky   but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love   and belonging and joy – the experiences  that make us the most vulnerable.” Her words are an invitation for us to  honour and acknowledge our vulnerabilities.   As each of us is human, each of us  is vulnerable in a variety of ways. As we open ourselves up honestly and  authentically with healthy boundaries in place,   we deepen our understanding of  ourselves and our connection to others.   And, as we practice this authentic opening,  we invite others to do the same with us. Let’s explore this a little further,  diving into the inner world: Take a moment to tune in  once again with your posture,   opening your heart space to be  witnessed, nurtured, and respected. And then take a moment to consider what  vulnerability means to you – and to   reflect mindfully upon what makes you vulnerable. If fear-based thoughts arise during this inquiry,  see if you might speak compassionately towards   them, reminding them that you are in a  safe space to explore what rests within. To love is to be vulnerable. To  create is to be vulnerable. To   take leaps of faith is to be vulnerable.  Allow this inquiry to expand and deepen. And now, returning your attention to the  center of your chest – perhaps resting   a palm or two on top of your heart –  silently repeat the following words: I am authentic, honest, and true. I am willing to be all of who I am. Vulnerability fuels compassion,  creativity, and growth. Take a moment now to thank yourself for  showing up for this courageous practice. And then, draw your attention to  your breath for another cycle or two.   Notice the breath’s innate ebb and flow. Draw your attention to the earth beneath  you… and to any sounds around you. And when you are ready, gently open your eyes. I hope you enjoyed today’s session. See you again.  English (United States)       
0 hello and welcome to day 10 of the expand  meditation program today is a wonderful   day not only because it's the last day of  the program and you made it through the   entire program so far but it's also the beginning  and continuation of your own meditation journey   maybe you have found those last 10 days  really hard and it was very hard for you to   sit down find time to practice or maybe you found  it very easy and it felt all really good for you   no matter how the experience was know that there  is no bad meditation so you showed up for yourself   and you did the work which is all that counts  usually we have a next steps video at the end of   every single one of our programs but this can  all be summarized in today's video and of course   the message that we want to send to you is to  keep going keep showing up really just don't   stop every single day is a new opportunity to  connect to yourself to learn more about yourself   to connect to stillness within and you do that  through your meditation practice so although the   program ends today we highly encourage you that  you continue again tomorrow with day one and just   keep repeating the program we strongly encourage  you to follow the program and go through it   for at least 30 days so two or three times more  through the full program so that you really have   established a solid habit and something that you  can rely on in the flow of life you can always   come back to this practice it will help you ground  it will help you lift you up no matter what life   is throwing at you you always have your practice  to come back to to reconnect only because your   experience of this program was a certain way  for the last 10 days doesn't mean that it has   to continue like this for the next 10 days or for  the next whatever how many days it could be that   the experience was so far challenging and the  next 10 days will be super easy and smooth and   you feel incredibly good it could also be that you  felt really good throughout the last 10 days the   next 10 days will be very challenging know that  this is completely normal that the meditation   progress is not really linear it comes in  different stages and there's ups and downs and   the important part is to not compare your  meditation practice and experience as it   is today to something that was a while ago  sometimes even when you're meditating for   many years it could be that at a certain time in  a certain stage it feels like you just started   out again and you feel like the meditations that  you did several years ago but know that this is   all part of the growth and part of the process  so the reminder here to just trust the process   keep showing up and treat every meditation  independently enjoy every meditation as it   is and as it unfolds each day when you are ready  to begin grab your pillow set everything up find   a comfortable seat take a few deep breaths  and whenever you're ready close your eyes take the next few breaths or  so to connect to your body notice what you're sitting on the  connection and support to and from the earth from there lengthen upwards through the spine in the beginning of your meditation  when you just sat down it's the time   to readjust to move around so that you can  sit effortlessly throughout this practice this helps to set you up right in the beginning  so that you can be as still as possible throughout your session establish  that connection to your breath that is   it has become so familiar  now over the last 10 days because you continue to show up every day to  sit down and feel the breath feel yourself feel the life force that is  included in the air you take in that keeps all the systems  going that keeps you going as well as the plants and animals and all  the other earthlings on this beautiful planet we all breathe the same air you all see the same sun the same moon feel the same rain mother nature is ultimately what connects us all that connects all beings that means reconnecting to mother nature is reconnecting to everything  it's reconnecting to life reconnecting to yourself each and every day as  you sit down perhaps for the rest of your life by really making your meditation practice a really solid part of your day it is through that that you discover more  about yourself you discover more about everything and everyone around you and you can bring more quality into all  the actions you do throughout the day continue to lean back into that pure  awareness where you observe the breath if distractions come up let them be and let them go treat yourself with kindness that you noticed and refocus on the breath there are three qualities of awakened doing with awakening being the realization  that you are not your thoughts but instead your being your true  self is separate from the thoughts it is which has the ability to observe the  thoughts those three doings are acceptance which is you being fully present  surrendering and accepting to what is it might seem like a passive  action or you being passive but it's not to be confused with not caring it is actively choosing to be okay  with something that's currently going on although your first instinct  or reaction or from the outside it seems like not such a good thing whatever is coming  your way in life through presence you accept you're accepting life the second awaken doing is enjoyment enjoyment is not something inward   flowing towards you it's not something  found in the activities or in the doing or in the work or in your surrounding it's from the deep connection to yourself within that you feel this enjoyment and let it grow so that it then is outward flowing from  within outwards into whatever you're doing the doing itself is the purpose of the doing not to reach any goal or anything you're  working towards that is helpful but secondary the act of doing right now is all that counts the third modality of awakened doing is enthusiasm it is you finding joy and fulfillment in your actions so much so that you are just really excited about it all your enthusiasm is so strong that you  cannot wait to do more of what you're doing because you enjoy doing it if you recognize any of these three in your life then the awakening process has already started where you go deeper and deeper  to yourself to life to nature at this point you cannot stop the process anymore you can only delay it and by establishing a meditation practice daily you can cultivate those  qualities let them grow go deeper the plant has already started to grow maybe you see a little bit of it already maybe  not if you continue to show up to meditate   to breathe to be you are watering that plant as you continue your meditation  practice over the next days weeks months and years imagine how much this can transform you  imagine how much this can transform your life your relationships your work all this enjoyment and all this quality  outward flowing into everything else   around you but coming from deep within it's  important to reconnect to that source within as often as possible maybe someday you don't have to reconnect anymore   because you are constantly in this state  of connection this is the true liberation also called moksha but it's all about feeling it within you feel it a little bit within yourself  you felt that spark the process has started   continue to show up day  after day to water the plants let it grow and enjoy enjoy what is unfolding notice the air coming in through the nose and out to the nose the breath is always with you there are many opportunities  for you throughout the day to feel it to reconnect to take a few minutes of breathing in and  out nice and slow there is no upper limit to   how many times you can reconnect throughout  the day in addition to your daily meditation practice if you're waiting in line if you're  waiting for the train or for your taxi consider just sitting down or standing eyes open or closed and breathe just for a minute maybe for five it's about this reconnection several  times throughout the day which   will really rewire your brain and create stronger connections of love peace relaxation presence and authenticity the journey has just begun you know the door and it's up to you to go through it to continue this practice the path will appear as you walk it day after day step by step feel the connection to the earth again length now to the spine when you feel ready bring your palms  together bring the hands to the heart to be so so proud of yourself for  showing up over the last 10 days sitting down to practice to reconnect that  space within you has always been there   but it's sometimes covered up this is why we come back to the practice  to sit reconnect to who you truly are from here on it's up to you  what you make of this journey but you are worth it to go deep to feel the  love for yourself for others to be happy to be at ease i wish you the best of luck  love and support on your journey thank you very much for practicing with us today with love and gratitude namaste  English      
0 hello and welcome to inspired meditations this guided meditation is called embrace a growth and success mindset 95% of our thoughts are repetitive if that's any indication of how we live our lives we repeat a lot day in and day out the problem with this is we begin to settle into a groove without growth and to be successful to achieve your goals you need to do something you haven't done before and think in a way you haven't thought before most people remain stuck in the same old patterns and limited beliefs and thoughts rendering them the same old results and lack of growth their goals have changed but their mindset has not and they repeat the same day even a tree planted firmly in the ground finds a way to grow it grows up and toward the sky your thoughts and beliefs impact your reality if you're currently operating on a fixed mindset old thoughts or you've hit too many dead ends you may think is is it or be convinced this is it please give this guy to meditation to listen don't settle for what you already have and nothing more when you are desiring so much more aren't you the least bit curious about what you are capable of new growth and successful thought patterns are something you can achieve with this guided meditation if you are ready and I believe you are let's begin settle yourself into your seat like you've never settled before go ahead let loose what have you got to lose give yourself permission to relax you can say to yourself permission to relax permission granted permission to slump over restfully like a sleeping dog or napping cat you will be relaxing and learning here and relaxing while you learn learning things for your benefit your growth your personal success just get really nice and comfortable committed to this process you are preparing to alter or enhance your current mindset in your favor instead of forcing it like you may be accustomed to by willpower or waiting on motivation you will settle into it easily naturally and almost effortlessly like easing into relaxation now no need to force it relaxation happens differently for everyone often the mind or the body resists pulling back just a little or a lot this resisting is a silly habit you can feel free to let go of at any time because what you really crave his deep relaxation whether you resist with a tense body or busy mind let me assure you it is natural it's better to release the urge to control the resisting than to push back do not resist the resisting let it go let nature take his course and let relaxation find your body ultimately either your mind or your body will release it first releasing the effort it takes just to relax instead it will resist the effort it takes to resist and simply give in to the feeling of complete and comfortable relaxation the kind of relaxation that soothes your mind and your body you may be wondering how much easier would be to just relax nestled in your protective corner of your mind wherever relaxation occurs for you loosen up your neck and shoulders wiggle or slouch into your seat  now is a good time to take a deep breath in and exhale releasing tension release whatever it is you're holding on to feel yourself relax deeper on the exhales another nice deep breath in through your nose and exhale releasing relaxing deeper into relaxation settling deeper into your seat checking whether your mind or your body feels more relaxed right now is your mind settling into the background or your body releasing tightness whichever it is see if you can notice it now and make a mental note of it body relaxed mind relaxed any and all relaxation is progress as you achieve a state of peace  take one more deep breath in through your nose really enjoying the process like a vacation and exhale let the tension deflate out of your shoulders your back your hips all the way down to your legs relaxation cascading down through your entire body washing over you soothing and effortless your breathing becomes regular and easy finding a natural rhythm for you gently closing your eyes if you haven't already quieting the mind pleasantly distracted with a simple game of counting backwards starting with 100 down to 99 imagine the numbers in your mind as you count down 98 97 96 down to 90 watching the numbers go down drifting down into deep relaxation still counting  down further still counting your way backwards and to relaxation and soon you spend less effort on counting and simply watch the numbers drift on and on and you can lose track of them if you like now at this point accomplishing just the right amount of relaxation for you releasing the numbers let go of any efforts now while you take this time to relax and learn in a special way for your growth your personal success and to see farther beyond what you have ever seen before listen carefully and diligently now that you are relaxed in your own way I can let you into a sacred space of growth one that will contribute to your personal success you can almost feel it now relaxed in mind and body you can let these learnings soak into you flow into your inner knowing listen now to this universal truth people grow evidence shows all people can purposely change and grow throughout their lifetime leading to positive effects both physically and mentally you can grow the hand you were dealt is just a starting point for development I wonder if you know you can grow through mistakes and setbacks too that's called learning and the more you learn the more you can do and the more knowledge you take with you to apply to your future success you can grow because you recognize your accomplishments maybe some you haven't noticed before you grow because you feel moved by possibilities ignoring what you think is impossible you can say I'm exploring this and just trying things out you have a GPS navigation pointing you towards something good at all times like an inner compass you can now see golden opportunities thanks to your focused growth mindset that you continually develop and expand unexpected events and happenstance leads to new opportunities you now recognize those opportunities considering changes you've always wanted to make they show up as a reality in your mind now the seed is planted for things to be set in motion learning from your difficulties every success story is sprinkled with difficulties learning in this meditation so that you can apply it to your life learning from the process of growth in order to grow your personal success discovering and focusing on your definition of success regardless of external influences learn and never forget or take for granted the lessons they are valuable beyond measurement this is your recipe for growth and now I want you to see what growth looks like open your mind up to your imagination I want you to see growth to see it presented to you through five doors just ahead of you imagine what those five doors look like you scope them out before approaching perhaps they are monotone and unassuming or colorful and eye-catching are they made of wood or metal or any other door material notice all these doors appear to be closed from a distance but as you come closer step by step you experience an open minded attitude open to possibilities open to good changes open to learning a special invitation awaits you from behind each door you ask yourself which of these doors looks the most open to me what more do I want to experience open any door and investigate any number of opportunities waiting for you keep this in mind you have infinite possibilities for growth in your life you have infinite ways of achieving your personal definition of success you may not continue to seek out what every door offers you develop the knowing and intuition to leave a door behind when it no longer serves you there are plenty of opportunities limitless invitations to grow begin to open doors in your own life step by step day by day you open yourself up to new ways of thinking and expanding your gaze beyond what is just in front of you there are always doors for you to open opportunities up ahead some doors will be there for you to learn others there to encourage you and even others will direct you somewhere else better suited for you and your goals you are open to opening the doors open to opportunities and growth that is rewarding open to possibilities open to learning developing yourself in your life day by day finding your way to your personal success noting that even your most basic abilities can be

stretching your existing abilities farther a growth mindset grows with you as long as you are growing and you are dedicated to growing you can change and grow as you apply meaning and dedication to the areas you wish to develop success to you takes on its own meaning and definition and significance for you when you enter now into your new and improved growth and success mind it's like entering into a new world learning is a good thing growing is natural relaxing reflection like in meditation becomes your navigation tool of choice seeking input and feedback and opportunities is a rewarding part of your success continue along the path enjoying the process most get curious about what works for you and what doesn't imagine yourself moving into a new space a bigger space so that you have room to grow you can spread out and learn you can unpack possibilities open up a few windows and let the light in feeling especially uplifted from this relaxing and important talk we had I'd like you

0 ﻿A Guided Meditation on the Body, Space & Awareness Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche Welcome! I’m very happy to share with you some meditation instructions. It is very simple: Please keep your spine straight. Just straight, but don't worry too much about perfection. I have to stay there, perfectly! Just keep straight. And please close your eyes. Just close your eyes like you’re sleeping. You don’t have to close them too tightly, or in any special way. And relax your muscles in your body. Relax the muscles in your head, forehead, face, ears, cheeks, throat, upper body, arms and hands, lower body, legs and feet. Just totally relax, yet with your spine straight. And bend your neck forward a little bit. It's almost like the weight of your head rests on your neck. You can effortlessly rest. Each part of the body rests on the one below. And in this way, you feel like you’re resting but there’s also some strength, so you can find balance. All the parts of your body are resting, one on top of the other. But, at the same time, there’s a strength within you. Your spine is straight. Sometimes you feel a little bit of gravity. And sometimes you feel some sensations. Just let it be. Whatever feeling is in your body, just be aware and let it be. When I was young, my father used to tell me, "Let your body be on the cushion, and let your mind be in the body." This way, you join body and mind together. Your mind comes into the body. Just be aware of your body, and be aware of any sensation or feelings in your body. Pleasant feelings, joy, bliss, or unpleasant feelings, tightness, pain, or neutral feelings, maybe tingling, or no feeling. So, with any type of feeling, just be aware and let it be. OK, for a few seconds, just be aware and relaxed. OK. Now, you can expand your awareness beyond your body, to what surrounds you. Maybe there are some sounds, or some smells, or some sensations, like your room temperature is a little bit too hot or cold, or some noise, like people chatting, or a car, a train, or airplanes moving around, or your neighbors making noise. Anything. Just be aware. Just know. Just recognize there are sounds. And your awareness becomes more open, and vaster. Stay there and be aware of any phenomena for a few seconds. Now, you can expand your awareness  beyond your immediate surrounding. Feel the space around you, above you, and be aware of that space. Further, deeper. All the phenomena are occurring in the space, changing in the space, dissolving back into the space. Like clouds, they come into the space, remain in the space, and dissolve into the space. And, now, you can expand your awareness even more. Go beyond the clouds, into space, which is boundless. Space, which is open in all directions, everywhere. Be there. Don’t worry, you’re not going to get lost. Stay there for few seconds. OK, now, please slowly open your eyes, and be present here. And rest your mind, also — not only the body. How do you rest your mind? For example: If you like to do physical exercise, like jogging in the garden or park, or hiking in the hills or mountains, maybe for a few minutes or hours... let’s say one hour... After you finish your jog, you may use a nice seat or a rock, or a grass field. Sit on the grass field and, with a big sigh, “Ahh,” just rest. You don’t have to meditate, just let your mind rest as it is and the body, also. Just rest... for a few seconds. Maybe you feel like, “Oh, there are so many thoughts, so many emotions occurring in my mind. What should I do with those emotions, those thoughts?” Same. Same as before, you just be aware. If there are thoughts and emotions, you’re just aware of thoughts and emotions, what I call “blah blah blah,” just look at the “blah blah blah,” be aware, and let it be. Same as when you’re aware of your body, aware of sounds and sensations, now it’s the same: Just be aware of thoughts and emotions. Let them come, and let them go. But, if you cannot be aware of them, it’s also fine. You're in a non-conceptual state of mind, but not too long — only for a few seconds. Again, when you see thoughts and emotions, or forms, sounds, smells — anything, just be aware... for a few seconds. If anything occurs in your mind, in your body, in your perceptions, just be aware, and let it be. OK. Now, you can apply this awareness, this openness, this awareness with any situation in your life, with any activities in your daily life. Short time, many times, everywhere, anytime. Seven days a week, 365 a year. In this way, you can fill your mind with joyful, peaceful experiences, and you will develop your inner love, compassion, and wisdom. Thank you!  English       
0 begin by getting in a comfortable seated position spine tall and straight sit bones balanced shoulders rolled away from the ears opening up that beautiful heart of yours letting your palms rest open in your lap and lovingly close your eyes tune into your breath and your body becoming present noticing how it feels as you breathe in and out letting your belly and rib cage expand on every in-breath and contract on every out breath as you tune into the weight of gravity letting the muscles in your face relax letting any muscles you do not need right now become loose with the weight of gravity [Music] then you tune in to you you say to yourself i am here with me now i choose to be my best friend and to offer myself the gift that a growth mindset brings [Music] feel this commitment to yourself in your heart for truly a growth mindset is a commitment it's not a one-time thing [Music] tune into your heart in the middle of your chest and a couple of inches inwards [Music] this is the energy center of your heart and in here lies an eager happy openness to committing to a growth mindset [Music] do you feel that happiness your heart is happy that you are open to committing to a growth mindset for it doesn't just affect your mindset mentally it affects your entire way of being it affects your emotions your physical body and of course your mental wellness as you tune into your heart you become clear why do you desire a growth mindset why do you feel it will serve you who do you wish to become [Music] as you tune in to your desire in your heart to become the best version of you you take a nice deep breath in stomach and ribcage fully expanding holding your breath at the top letting this desire to be the best version of you build and when you're ready exhale with a sigh [Music] you tune in to that desire to grow to be open to feedback to be committed to you and you let that desire flow as you breathe in and out and listen to these words as they spark more desire within you [Music] and start to even turn from desire into action for you feel open and knowing that the more you listen to the following messages the more you will start to shift into a growth mindset keep breathing and listen to these words and let them move you [Music] you are responsible for your thoughts yes the world around you has influenced you in some way but it ultimately is up to you to decide what is true to you you create your reality with the beliefs you have and the beliefs you have are just thoughts you've been thinking over and over [Music] you have the power to think new thoughts every time a thought occurs that you wonder does this serve me if the answer is no you can choose a new thought much like attending to a garden that perhaps has been long overlooked for years and years and there are many weeds and tangled roots it takes time to pull out what's no longer needed in that garden the weeds may keep growing back time and time again but the more you tend to the garden the more you plant the seeds you wish to see in the garden the more your garden becomes that which you desire it to be it takes daily work and daily cultivation the same is true with your mind and when you become the gardener of your mind you become a master at growth mindset because you know you can change the landscape of your mind masterfully you can curate it to be whatever you wish it to be you become open to feedback from others you become non-resistant because you know that everything you see witness here you are the one who ultimately decides whether or not you keep it [Music] whether or not it is part of the garden you wish to [Music] cultivate in the past perhaps you have allowed yourself to feel triggered by someone's words or actions and perhaps you thought that was a bad thing now as the gardener of the landscape in your mind you recognize that any time you feel triggered it's quite similar to stumbling upon a patch of bittersweet in the garden this is an invasive species that can choke out the other plants instead of viewing it as a bad thing you now with your growth mindset simply view it as something to take care of when you focus on what you would rather see and stand you allow yourself to remove that which doesn't serve and you only view that which doesn't serve as guidance versus a bad thing you are the gardener of the landscape of your mind continually shaping molding and cultivating beliefs and views that serve you it is a daily commitment feel in your heart how committed you are as you affirm to yourself i cultivate the landscape of my mind i choose a growth mindset every time i am faced with anything i view as an obstacle or bad i choose to curate thoughts and beliefs that serve me [Music] i'm open to growth and commitment to growth now take a nice big deep breath in stomach and rib cage fully expanding holding your breath at the top and when you're ready exhale with a sigh [Music] take this feeling and commitment with you as you begin to roll your shoulders wiggle your fingers and toes and when you're ready slowly open your eyes back to the world around you [Music] now go out there as the gardener of your inner landscape of your mind and enjoy cultivating the thoughts and beliefs you wish to see you
0 Learn New Skills | Guided Meditation To Learn Faster A New Skill Learning something new represents a challenge as we know we will be forced to leave our comfort zone. Sometimes we pass on learning something new because we fear we couldn't “get it right”; it’s just too hard or will take too much time. However, there are times when learning something new is easy and exciting in the beginning, but as we dive deeper into the skill, frustrations may emerge. The frustration barrier doesn’t just make learning more difficult; it is also demotivating. When you face the barrier repeatedly, you may start to believe that you are not born with the talents necessary to succeed in the particular skill you are trying to learn. Whether it be learning how to code, drawing, play a new sport or business, there’s no skill that you can’t acquire. In this meditation, we will grow your mental capacity to learn faster, memorize more, and keep yourself motivated. It is recommended to do this meditation every time before practice your new desired skill to maximize your learning potential. Let's begin Find a quiet place where you can lay down or sit in a comfortable position without being disturbed. Allow your eyelids to close over your eyes softly. Slowly take a deep breath in...hold for a moment and slowly let the breath all the way out. Take a few more deep breaths. Gently all the way in - pause and slowly, all the way out. On every exhale, your body relaxes more and more. As you focus on my voice, your mind calms down and opens to the positive suggestions of becoming very good at a desired new skill. Now, I would like you to call to mind a skill you already have and are good at. It can be driving a car or a bicycle. Maybe, cooking, work, or business-related. Anything that comes to your mind. In your mind's eye, visualize yourself practicing this skill. Take a few moments to enjoy it. How does it feel doing something that you are good at? Remember the time when you learned that skill. When was it? How did you learn it? Was it easy or hard? Take notes on how you feel knowing that you pass a long way to learn that skill, and you are here, now enjoying it. Proud of it. Now, I would like you to call to mind the skill you want to develop. It could be one that you find particularly challenging. It could be a skill that you have been trying to acquire for some time. Take a moment and visualize yourself practicing this skill. Zoom-in on the details. What do you feel? If you sense any frustration or anxiety emerging, take a deep inhale, and as you exhale, let it go. Now, I would like you to find a connection between your desired skill and the one you already acquire. The connection does not have to be a direct one. Take a moment to find a connection, small or big. As your mind bridges the gap between the two skills, visualize yourself practicing the new desired skill with the same confidence and pleasure you practice the skill you already possess. See yourself improving and getting better and better. It’s becoming too easy. This skill cannot be taken away. This skill is a part of you. Notice all there is to notice, from your breath to your posture and how you feel. Allow yourself to relish in this moment of victory. You may sense the corners of your mouth curl up into a smile. You may even jump up in celebration in your mind's eye. And as you celebrate getting good at your new skill, repeat the following affirmation in your mind. My brain can easily contain a lot of information. I can learn anything I choose to. I’m finding learning new things easy and fun. I believe in myself and my abilities. I have a great memory. My desire to learn new things increases daily. I am always motivated to learn new things. I am a naturally smart and intelligent person. I have full confidence in my learning abilities. Let yourself feel a sense of fulfillment. Take a moment to thank yourself for showing up to your practice and taking the time to develop a skill that you truly desire. Stay in this sense of gratitude for a few more moments, the gratitude for learning a new skill, your ability, and your mindset. When you are ready, slowly come back to your physical body. Wiggle the fingers and toes. At your own pace, open the eyes.

0 Awaken Your Intuition |10 Minute Guided Meditation To Enhance Your Inner Voice Your intuition is the heart of your soul. It connects you to a higher intelligence that protects you and guides you. It knows everything you want in this lifetime. And, it knows how to get you there. All you need to do is quiet the mind, ask a question, and listen to your heart. This meditation will guide you to tap into your intuition’s infinite wisdom and transform your life in a magical way. Begin by finding a comfortable position sitting or laying down. When you are ready, gently close your eyes and let out a deep breath. Exhale all that you have been carrying around with you throughout the day. This is a new moment. Leave everything else in the past and bring your awareness to this moment. As you inhale through the nose, slowly follow your breath as it travels from your nostrils, down your throat, and into your lungs. Feel the air expand and fill up your entire chest. And as you exhale, focus on the steady stream of air that comes from out of your body. Keep focusing on your breathe a few more moments, and let your body fully relax. Anytime you notice your thoughts wandering off, bring yourself back to the present moment by focusing on your breathing. You are safe here. Surrender to this moment. Now, we are going deeper into relaxation. Bring your attention to your feet. Imagine warm energy slowly pouring over your feet and going up to your legs. Feel how all the tension is leaving your feet and legs. Visualize the energy going up to your torso. Feel your lower body getting heavier and heavier. As the energy goes up, it relaxes your stomach, chest, shoulders, arms, neck. Imagine this energy like a blanket that melts and hugs your entire body. Feel your body as it’s pulled by gravity, sinking deeper into the surface beneath you. Feel the energy going up and loosen all your face muscles. Allow this relaxing feeling to release all the tension from your body. From this place of full relaxation, shift your attention to the space between your eyebrows. This is your third eye chakra. It is the place where your soul meets your physical body. It also provides the wisdom necessary to access truth beyond time and space. Imagine a single point of purple energy penetrating the space between your eyebrows. Visualize the purply energy going deeper into your skull. Extend that energy outwards as well, and imagine the purple light beaming out of your third eye. Feel the tingling sensation as you bring focused attention to this area. You may also feel a buzz of powerful energy all around your forehead. Go deeper into the sensation as you connect to your intuition center. Now, think about an area of your life that you would like guidance or clarity on and form a question that could shed light on it. Ask for the answer to be revealed to you. Be open to any information you receive. Notice any thoughts that arise. Avoid censoring your thoughts or processing them with your rational mind. Just observe what comes up without overthinking about it. Even if things don’t seem to make sense or the answers feel incomplete, just note everything that comes up without judgment. If it feels right to do so, ask additional questions, one at a time. But, do not force the answers. If you still feel that you need more information, let it come to you. Know that your intuition will communicate to you in perfect timing. Your intuition has heard you, and the answers will come. With this understanding, relax your mind and focus on the space between your eyebrows once again. Take three deep breaths. With each inhale, breathe in light. With each exhale, breathe out worry and fear. Repeat these affirmations either out loud or in your head: I trust myself and the voice that speaks within me. All that I need to know at this moment is revealed to me. I am always in the right place at the right time. My intuition effortlessly guides me. My intuition guides me to everything that is meant for me. I am wise, intuitive, and connected to my inner guidance. I am one with the highest intelligence that guides my soul. Take one last deep breath and wiggle your fingers and toes to bring awareness back to your body. Shake your arms and legs gently. Gently open your eyes and bring your awareness back to your surroundings.

0 Welcome to SoothingPod’s meditation. In today’s meditation, we will be exploring  what it means to be creative, as well as how we   can better express ourselves with courage. And,  what does it take to colour outside the lines? Before we dive into this exploration,  take a moment to tune into this present   moment by bringing yourself to  a comfortable seated position. Gently elongate the spine, neck included,   and then allow your arms to rise up  overhead for a momentary stretch… … and then release them back down to rest  on the thighs, the knees, or in your lap. Draw your attention now to the breath,   mindfully watching the path it takes from the  outer world to the inner… and then back out again. Notice your breaths current rhythm and depth   as you begin to settle more comfortably into  this space. With every mindful breath we take,   the racing mind softens and we become more  receptive to whatever is here right now. Continuing to breathe mindfully,  expand your awareness to include   any other sensations you might be experiencing. Perhaps you notice a tingling sensation…  a tightness… a softening… or an expansion. Whatever is the case for you right now, simply  witness each sensation without any judgment,   inviting the breath deep into any areas  of tension if discomfort is present. Inhale a sense of nourishment and inspiration… … and exhale all tension, all fear, and  any discomfort that might be present.   If you feel completely at  ease in this moment already,   simply continue to watch the breath move  through you, cleansing you as it does so. Take just a few more breaths in silence, releasing  any rising thoughts with each exhalation. Creativity is often believed to be something  exclusive to people such as painters, poets,   and playwrights. And while these people do  tend to embody a high degree of creativity,   the essence of creativity is  something much broader than this. Creativity is the use of imagination or  inventiveness to create something new and   original, and by this definition, creativity is  something that all of us embody. Whether on paper   or canvas, or in our homes and relationships,  creativity expresses itself in numerous ways. In the words of writer Elizabeth Gilbert,  “If you’re alive, you’re a creative person.” Creativity is required to navigate  complicated relationships,   just as much as it’s needed to  compose a great piece of music.   Of course these are very different examples of  the use of creativity, but at the core of them,   they require the same things: courage, confidence,  and a willingness to step beyond the familiar. To be creative, we need to be willing to make  mistakes – to be willing to colour outside of   the lines. Through mistakes, we learn.  Through colouring beyond our boundaries,   we discover we are capable of far  more than we had previously imagined. So, take a moment now to return to your breath,   silently inviting your innate capacity  for creativity to rise to the surface. Now, silently repeat the words: My imagination has no bounds. I honour my unique expression of creativity. I am willing to draw outside of the lines. Continuing to breathe slowly and steadily,  with these affirmations lingering in mind,   notice how it feels to honour the  creative energy within your being. And, if the mind intervenes to  deny your embodiment of creativity,   gently invite these self-limiting beliefs  into the heart for healing and release. When it comes to creativity, it is not possible to  compare ourselves to any standards we might hold.   Our creative energy and potential is  unique to who we are as individuals. Take another deep breath in, all  the way to the base of the belly…  And as you exhale, release any fears,   any limitations, or any standards you might  hold for yourself in relation to creativity. Gently allow the heart space to  open wider on your next inhalation,   inviting your courage and confidence  to rise alongside your creativity. Take just a few more slow and steady breaths now,  silently honouring your unique creative potential. Observe the natural ebb and flow of one more   breath… … and then shift your attention back  to your physical presence in this room. When you are ready, gently open your eyes.  I hope you enjoyed today’s  meditation. See you again.  English (United States)       
0 if it's comfortable for you let's begin by taking a gentle deep breath in through the nose and out through the mouth and with that exhalation adopting a comfortable posture of awareness returning the breath to its natural rhythm and allowing your attention to gently drop into this present moment and without turning or looking around just lightly bringing into your awareness all that's in your surrounding space and with your next out breath allowing your focus to fall onto one specific object that's in your field of vision and it's not an intense stare so just maintaining it as a very soft focus and this is a gentle practice so if at any point the eyes become fatigued allowing yourself to gently close them for a moment or two and then reopening them nice and easy noticing as any thoughts come and go and just returning the attention back to your object and now letting the focus zoom back out again being aware of your surroundings perhaps blinking a few times allowing this cultivated focus to follow you into your next activity [Music] you
0 Welcome to Soothing Pod’s meditation.  In this session, we’ll explore the   ways our meditation practice can help us  better enjoy who we are and what we do.   Begin by finding a quiet place to sit.   Gently close your eyes, and  let your spine lengthen.   As you sit up tall, release any unnecessary  tension so that you stay alert yet relaxed.   And as you start to settle  in, take a few deep breaths.   As you exhale, let go of any  expectations you have for your practice.   Let go of commitments for the rest of your day.   And set aside whatever you  don’t need at this moment.   Now, turn towards your breath.   Soft, smooth inhales and exhales.   There’s no need to shape or control your  breath. Instead, notice its natural flow.   Observe your breath’s length.  Notice its depth… its temperature.   Just let your breath be as it is, and stay  present from the start of each inhalation   to the end of each exhalation.   As you breathe in, watch the breath moving  through your nostrils... your ribs expanding...   your belly rising. As you breathe out,  follow the movement of your belly releasing,   your ribs gently contracting, and your  breath moving out of your nostrils again.   Stay with the whole cycle of your breath,  noticing your whole body breathing with you.   And now, invoke a sense of  appreciation for your breath.   As you observe each cycle, enjoy the wave of  your breath. Notice the freshness of each inhale.   The soft ease of the exhales.   And when your mind inevitably wanders,   drop any judgments or labels, and bring your  attention back to your breath once more.   Tap into the ebb and flow of your  breath with kindness and appreciation.   Now, allow your awareness to soften.   Have you ever stopped to ask yourself  if you like the person that you are   and the life that you’ve created? Regardless of  what your life looks like, it can be exhausting   to live in a world where we don’t like who we are  or what we do. And no matter how hard we work or   how many goals we manage to reach, we’ll never  feel truly content until we learn to accept,   to like, and eventually to love who we are. Liking  ourselves isn’t about landing our ideal job,   living in our dream house, or having the  perfect family. It’s about learning to hold   ourselves with love and respect, celebrating  our strengths, and honoring our weaknesses.   Meditation is a powerful tool which helps us step  more fully into our authentic selves, and learn to   appreciate our unique gifts and qualities. Every  time we make room for our breath, just as it is,   we are developing self-acceptance. And when we  turn towards our experience with appreciation   and kindness, we are building our capacity  to honor and celebrate ourselves. It is   from this place that we also learn  to appreciate and value who we are,   how we speak and act, and how we move  through our days. As Maya Angelou once said:   “Success is liking yourself, liking  what you do, and liking how you do it.”   Now, slowly come back to your breath and send  a wave of appreciation into your whole body.   When you’re ready, wiggle your fingers  and toes. And let your eyes softly open.   Enjoy the rest of your day, and  we’ll see you back here soon.  English (United States)

0 you welcome to this guided meditation focusing on being open to change for growth and uncovering your values find a position you can be comfortable in turn off all distractions and settle in for the next 20 minutes or so close your eyes and begin to bring your awareness to your breath without changing your breath without any judgments or expectations of what it should or shouldn't be notice how your breath flows in through your nose and fills up your body with life as it flows out each exhale takes with it any physical and emotional tension as if that tension just melts away from your body to be gone forever as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer then allow the thoughts to pass by you can say in your mind thinking and allow that thought to move on and return your attention to your breath and to the sound of my voice as your guide on this journey of relaxation and discovery now as you begin to deepen each breath in and out notice the stillness that comes between each inhale and exhale as your breath deepens focus your attention on the stillness between the breaths take another deep slow breath in making your deepest breath yet fill your lungs completely and then release the breath through your mouth like a sigh empty your lungs completely and feel all the tension in your body loosen then inviting your breath to return to a natural rhythm allow each breath to deepen your level of relaxation give yourself permission to be fully supported by the surface below you to turn off all distractions and to be open to the possibilities of what comes with a state of comfort as you move deeper into this meditation approach it with the intention of letting go of expectations letting go of comparisons and just discover what comes up without any judgement and now turn your attention to the top of your head and imagine there is a warm light surrounding you and protecting you visualize this light see the lights color see the glowing nature of the soft warm light and as this light passes over your body it progressively relaxes you and releases each muscle small and large from your head all the way down to your toes so you begin to feel your forehead soften and smooth your eyebrows and eyes melt the tiny muscles around your eyes release you feel your eyelids becoming very heavy your cheeks lengthen down on the sides of your face you part your teeth unclench your jaw and relax your tongue you feel your throat softening and as the muscles around your eyes let go and the jaw releases the rest of the body knows what to do and will respond by letting go of any held tension as well you see and feel the warm glowing light moving downwards continuing this progressive relaxation like a wave washing over you feel the tension melting out of your shoulders moving down your arms so that the tension flows out of your body through your fingertips feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and connected to the Earth's energy as you allow it to let go this connection of energy will support you on your journey of self-discovery today with each breath your chest and abdomen begin to feel heavy and you are fully supported by your surroundings and protected by this glowing calming light as it continues the relaxation process and notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper this light continues to move down your body releasing the tension from your lower back and hips your thighs and pelvis feel very heavy and sink down into the surface below you your knee is softened and your calves melt as your body continues to rest heavy your ankles and feet let go of any remaining tension that your body may still feel to be completely relaxed safe and supported now take one more moment to scan your body for any residual tightness pain or tension and then breathe into that area so that you can completely let go and surrender to the heaviness of gravity and now your whole body is heavy on the earth strongly connected and rooted into the Earth's energy we are all connected in this world every living thing there are no gaps between us we are exchanging molecules with each other constantly with the animals with the trees with the water we are one collective field of energy now that you are deeply relaxed begin to use your imagination and visualize yourself outside on a wooded trail take in your surroundings with all of your senses you can see the gentle rays of sunshine coming through the branches of the trees Sun castle gentle warmth on your skin and you feel that the temperature is perfect for you the air feels pure and smells fresh and clean notice how your feet feel on the path and how the surface below feels in contact with your feet look at your surroundings and take in all the sights of nature it is peaceful and quiet on this wooded trail and you can feel your body remain in its calm and relaxed state feeling very safe you begin to walk along the trail and your attention is drawn to a small lake on one side of the path in the distance although the water is calm you can hear the noise the water makes as it moves with the breeze you feel yourself walking in the direction of the water slowly moving step by step you get to the sloping bank of the water and look out at the sparkling reflections of the trees and the Sun on the glassy water standing on the bank of the lake you root your feet down and feel the Earth's energy come up through your body taking in this energy into your body it grounds you and centers you you feel this energy all the way up to your head and all around you protecting you and supporting you you feel the Earth's energy in your heart and your soul this energy relaxes you even more deeply it is supportive and enjoyable to feel and connect to the Earth's energy this energy is pure love now imagine your feet are growing roots down into the earth they are powerful holding you firm and strong see these roots growing down into the earth growing down deep into the soil to support you through the strongest winds the most challenging times now that you are grounded and connected to the collective energy around you take in this loving energy bring it in word begin to connect to your heart explore what you are feeling in this moment if you have thoughts that are coming to a mind

Earth's energy is grounding and your strong roots will you support you on your journey of discovery and growth in your mind continue walking along the wooded trail as you begin to explore the idea of your values and with each step you will find that you are becoming more and more relaxed allow your mind to wander and be imaginative you are aware of your thoughts and you know you have the ability to change from a negative thought to a positive one just by being aware you know all it takes is a thought to make a change you change your life the moment you decide to change you choose to live life how you choose to live life you know that you are not the sum of your circumstances you are the sum of your choices so you choose to live in alignment with what is truly important to you now begin to imagine if you could not fail what would your ideal self look like see the image of yourself in vivid detail there are no financial or time restraints and nothing is getting in your way what would your most desirable goals and dreams be this can be how you would like to live how you would like to show up in this world how you would like to feel or what you would like to accomplish and most

ideal life what are the personal values that you live by and that guide your decisions you what and who is most important to you what would it look like for you to give more value by doing what you love in the world around you and how will that feel draw those feelings up to the surface for you now while you may not know your future clearly your values and visions are coming to the surface and are becoming more concrete now that you have a clear image of what you really want you know you are moving towards this vision this ideal self this ideal version of you you know what to do to live in alignment with what you really want when there is a choice to make you can see it clearly you have an anchor to lean on this image of your ideal life this is what you really want it is easy to get off track when you do not define what you want in your life but now you know now you can see it you can even feel it it is happening and you know you are on the right track you are growing towards your ideal self right now whenever you have a choice you find it as easy to say to yourself this is how I live my life this is an alignment with what I truly want and what is important to me as your goals dreams and values begin to unfold in your mind you feel a building sense of increased motivation and purpose arising inside you you begin to realize that to change anything that change must begin with you and you are ready to take action toward your ideal life you have planted the seeds for your future consider again how will you feel when these goals and dreams are your reality and now that you have your sights set for the future realize that you are a confident person and you believe in your abilities you accomplish your goals and you are grateful for your successes your thoughts are positive and give you the confidence to grow and reach your goals this confidence keeps you motivated and willing to move out of your comfort zone you are focused yet open to possibilities of positive experiences with the clarity of your values your path has been illuminated for you opportunities present themselves often and you are prepared for anything that comes your way in your mind your thoughts are positive and you know you have the choice to live the life that you want in your mind consider the choices you have and repeat these phrases after me I choose to love deeply I choose to breathe deeply I choose to laugh and feel joy I choose to live with passion I choose to be courageous I choose to live with my whole heart I choose abundance in all aspects of my life I choose an authentic life I choose to be patient on this journey to change and growth take one more moment and consider how you choose to live your life and now let go of any negative thoughts that no longer serve you see your limiting beliefs and behaviors disappear self-doubt and fear are things of the past and you replace them with confidence and conviction you trust your instincts and your abilities you know there is no failure only opportunities to learn and grow here today you have planted the seeds for your ideal life you are confident and positive and taking action in the right direction to successfully reach your goals you are open to the possibilities as they unfold and you are committed to living in alignment with your personal values now bring your attention back to the wooded trail

reach your goals you begin to walk away from the water feeling confident knowing that you can and will succeed and when you awake you will still feel this way and now bring your awareness back to the present moment back to your physical body to the surface below you you are feeling relaxed yet energized and confident your mind is clear you are committed to living in alignment with your values you believe in yourself and you are motivated to grow towards your ideal self begin to bring some gentle movements to your fingers and toes feeling a warm rush of energy flow over you and now you're fully

yourself get in a comfortable chair or lying in bed and taking a nice big deep breath and as he release it imagine the tension getting to leave your body and with your eyes closed focus your attention at the bottoms of your feet imagine that their cords going from the soles of your feet down into the earth grounding you and ultimately connecting you imagine that there's now stream of liquid relaxation now flowing up to the center of those courts into the soles of your feet and imagine that liquid relaxation is now spreading throughout the bottoms of your feet relaxing here feeling very calm and peaceful and any outside noises that you may become aware of will simply help you to relax more and more and that liquid relaxation is now spreading spreading to the tops of your feet to your ankles relaxing you even more as you sink deeper and deeper down continuing to focus on this Pleasant feeling liquid relaxation now spreads through your shins your calves your knees and your thighs and your legs are feeling very relaxed now as you're sinking deeper and deeper down and that liquid relaxation is now flowing through your hips your pelvis your stomach feeling very relaxed and it feels so good to just let go and to allow this liquid relaxation to spread throughout your body very nerve so working at muscle and their liquid relaxation it's now flowing into your chest filling your heart and lungs allowing you to brave deeper and even more relaxed and now that liquid relaxation spreading to your shoulders softening all the muscles there in your shoulders and it might even feel like a great weight just been lifted from your shoulders relaxing you even more you're sinking deeper down and the liquid relaxation now spreads from your shoulders down through your back softening each and every muscle there in your back and now that liquid relaxation spreads from your shoulders down through each arm down to your elbows your forearms your wrists and your hands all the way down to your fingertips and it's so calm so peaceful and the liquid relaxation is now spreading through your neck and throat beer chin and jaw through your cheeks behind your eyes or your forehead on the top of your head and every part of your face is completely relaxed in fact your entire body from the tips of your toes to the top of your head it's filled with this wonderful liquid relaxation and you're feeling so calm and unpeaceful now in just a moment I will begin the countdown and with each descending number your level of relaxation multiple want that to happen and allow that to happen five sinking deeper and deeper down four so calm so peaceful and so relaxed three letting go and it feels so good to just let go two getting even closer now one now peacefully and comfortably relaxed and now that you relaxed it's important to know and all things are possible in this private Haven this peaceful place let's take a walk out of your sanctuary and into a garden now as you walk through this beautiful garden notice the beautiful flowers along each side and you feel more peaceful and comfortable deep snap feeling so contempt and this path leads you to further enlightenment along this path you easily experience spiritual growth however your journey comes to an abrupt end when you suddenly see before you stone rock wall approach the wall that barricades your way as you look around on either side of the mall you see that there's no way around this wall and as you look up at how high the wall is you realize that you have to go past this wall the progress on your journey remaining on the side of the wall limits your personal growth perhaps you can jump over this wall move back just a bit and run a few steps jumping up as high as you can however you cannot reach the top you slide back down and this time you walk back even further and you run harder and jump towards the top of this wall but you still cannot reach the top again you slide back down the wall so now you go back many feet and with a running start you run as hard as you can and jump as high as you can and clench your fingers on the top of the wall soon start scratching your arms hurting your elbows as you fall back upon the ground and suddenly you realize that this wall it's a part of yourself that you've repressed it's a part of you carefully hidden from the world and perhaps even yourself this wall was a block on your journey through life it's a part of yourself and needs to be healed but you must move beyond this wall in order to continue to grow and learn about yourself so one more time we try to go over this wall you start back even further and run harder you jump as high as you can climbing grasping at the wall but you slide down scratching your face and hands hurt your knees and as you stand up and look at yourself you realize that to fight this wall will destroy you so you think what am I gonna do how am I gonna get past this wall this part of myself that needs to be healed if it's important for you to know take a moment now to understand a part of you is causing this block what is the emotion or event that has kept you stuck walk up now and place your hands on the wall you can smell the stones and feel the roughness of the wall you realize again there's no way around this wall and no way to go over or under this wall you have to go through the wall ask yourself I will take you through this wall all your beliefs will help you now a belief in yourself that you can do anything and you can do it begin the pro one foot into the wall and feel your foot go into the wall put one hand into the wall bring your other foot into the wall and your other hand into the wall you're now a few inches unto the wall it's becoming very clear now you have to get through this block in order to heal there's no way around it no way over it in no way to go under it take one more step and another step and soon you realize that the wall is very thick but you're standing in it somewhere in the middle of this wall breathing easily and effortlessly standing in the middle of your block you may be wondering how can I do this how can I move myself through a wall did you have a choice you may go back to the other side of the wall or you can continue toward greater freedom and personal growth and if you decide to continue through this wall take another step and another step and as you can get almost to the edge of the wall you have to decide can I continue can I break through this wall can I get through this block you can do it just take one more step push yourself out suddenly you're standing on the other side of this wall you see a strange new world before you a world they've never seen before free open healthy world for you to personally experience freed forever from your block continue on your path now notice how different you feel as you continue on this path you come to a lake stop and look at your reflection in the water see how different you look now your thoughts are different your view of the world has changed the world around you seems brighter more clear the colors are more vibrant the air even smells fresher enjoy this new improved world within take a few moments now to absorb this transformation enjoying the shift within at your deepest level absorbing the change and every cell every thought and every believe you accepting all suggestions which were positive and beneficial for you and releasing anything that does not fit into your life at this time in just a moment I will invite you to return from your experience and as you return you will bring back your experience with you feeling calm and refreshed one feeling returning to your fingers and toes to all energies and complete balance Theret body closed three feeling more confident and in control realizing things that used to bother you in the past have now been released for feeling as if your eyes haven't bathe and cool clear water five realizing you have now release the blocks and now you'll experience more self development and spiritual growth eyes open fully aware you

0 begin by sitting in a comfortable position make sure you are in a place where you will not be interrupted let your spine grow tall and straight roll your shoulders back slightly to open up your heart place your palms in your lap facing upwards and whenever you're ready lovingly close your eyes begin by allowing all of your awareness to center in on your breath without judging it or trying to change it for now just notice it paying attention to how it feels as it enters and exits your body becoming curious about what muscles you are engaging as you breathe extending your awareness you noticing the feeling of gravity on your body using this awareness to drop into your body in this present moment and now on your next inhale allow your stomach to expand fully as you breathe in deeply rib cage expands and you hold your breath at the top and as it feels right to you exhale with a sigh at the bottom of this breath and just return to breathing at a pace that's comfortable for you stomach expanding as you breathe in and contracting as you breathe out throughout the course of this meditation you begin to see yourself standing on a trail before you the trail splits into five different pathways going from left to right we will number the trails as one through five trail one on your left shows you the version of you in the future that is as if you just stayed exactly the same as you are now you see that version of you smiling and waving at you much yourself become aware of that version this should be easy to do as they are exactly as you are right now you may even see them in the clothes you are wearing in this very moment [Music] regardless of how much you desire change much yourself lovingly wave back at them feeling grateful that they are here [Music] appreciating where you are right now and with that appreciation you allow your awareness to turn to Path number two here you see a version of yourself who has made one small alteration to their life what is this small change that they made perhaps it's a tiny change you've been thinking of doing [Music] how does this change affect their life [Music] how does it affect their appearance their personality or the successes that they have let yourself see this version of you clearly see them smiling and waving at you as you smile and wave back and now on path green the middle path the one directly before you you see a version of you who has made several small changes nothing too big but enough to make a difference on their life what do they look like what changes have they made [Music] perhaps they've achieved goals that you've had in mind for a long time see them smiling and waving at you as you smile and wave back and now on the fourth path you see the version of you that has reached the goals and dreams you currently have notice how they feel and look it's as if you can sense the emotions but they are feeling the accomplishments they've achieved notice how that feels within you see them smiling and waving at you as you smile and wave back [Music] and now as you turn your awareness to the right to path number five you see the version of you that's gone way above and beyond all the changes all the goals that you had in mind their success is way beyond anything you had yet imagined take a moment to see what that looks like what have they done what is their appearance like tune into how they feel and let yourself feel their emotions they smile and wave at you as you smile and wave back and as you look at all five of these versions of you while smiling and waving you know in your heart which path you desire to follow and you happily walk down the path towards the version of you you most desire to be right now see yourself standing before this version of you and as soon as you are face to face all the other paths just melt away it's just you and this desired version of you the person you most want to be look into their eyes [Music] allow your heart to connect to their heart [Music] tune into a confidence in their eyes there's a confidence and a wisdom of knowing who they are tune into your heart as it connects to theirs feel how it feels to be them what accomplishments have they achieved what material objects do they have how fulfilled are they in love and their financial life [Music] and in terms of their physical health feel all of these aspects and imagine your body merging with theirs becoming who they are aligning fully with this desired version of yourself if this is what you desire yourself to be this is who you truly are take a deep breath into the snowing let your stomach fully expand and hold your breath at the top let the feeling of being this version of you build within Europe and as it feels right to you exhale with a sigh this is your birthright everywhere you go throughout the rest of the day remind yourself of this feeling feeling yourself aligned with the truest version of you your most desired version of you who you truly are and who you truly want to be and take this feeling with you everywhere you go as you slowly bring your awareness back to the room around you opening your eyes whenever you are ready [Music] you  English (auto-generated)      
0 allow your body to get very relaxed whatever position most supports you to do this trust yourself and get into that position now [Music] once you're ready softly close your eyes and begin to tune in to your breath and your body allowing your breath to slow down now and begin to become more intentional belly expanding on every in-breath and contracting on every out-breath [Music] allowing the air to flow smoothly and [Music] gently as you scan your awareness to find any muscles you're holding on to that you do not need right now [Music] allow gravity to take over [Music] only using the muscles that you need right now and letting all of the others relax [Music] it is safe for you to allow your body to be heavy right now it is safe for you to relax [Music] you now begin to receive an energetic massage as you feel the highest most loving energy entering in you may see this as white light but either way feel the love [Music] it may feel like tingling massaging [Music] peaceful sensations [Music] relax and allow trust and know you are getting your body ready to do this magnificent work [Music] this experience is for your highest most loving good [Music] allow yourself to relax even more now [Music] dropping down [Music] letting go [Music] and you begin to see yourself walking down a long dark corridor with a golden glowing light at the end this space you're walking through feels peaceful [Music] and yet mysterious in a way that sparks your curiosity compelling you to continue to walk towards the golden light the closer you get the brighter it becomes until you step out of the corridor and enter in to bright golden glittering light [Music] it's as if you are suspended in the center of this golden light [Music] it's as if you are deep within your mind [Music] take a couple more breaths relaxing in this space [Music] and notice that all around you in a circle right now [Music] appear your highest most loving guides some may be different versions of you or perhaps you just feel sense or see energy forms either way feel the love and support here [Music] one of these guides reaches out their hand to give you a golden seed [Music] you place this seed in the palms of your hands and gaze at it lovingly [Music] in this seed you affirm the following thoughts ensuring the energy of these thoughts and feelings enters into the scene i am love i am fortunate all is well [Music] spend a few more breaths infusing this scene with more loving thoughts that come to you now [Music] and as you feel these thoughts allow yourself to be very aware of how the seed is being infused with the energy of these thoughts [Music] me [Music] [Music] allow yourself to wrap up your thoughts and notice how this seed is glittering in golden light [Music] and imagine you are planting the scene in the center of your mind [Music] covering it metaphorically with earth trusting whatever that looks or feels like to you [Music] and more importantly feeling the seed being planted [Music] feeling your energy transforming as it is and with this seed within you [Music] and your highest most loving guides around you you affirm to yourself i am that i am [Music] feel deeply appreciative to yourself for showing up for this practice appreciative for the changes that are to unfold from here [Music] and when you're ready take a nice big deep breath in stomach and rib cage fully expanding holding your breath when you reach the top and when you're ready exhale with a sigh [Music] begin to bring your awareness back to your body where it is right now [Music] as your breath returns to whatever pace feels good to you you take this beautiful feeling you've created with you as you begin to roll your shoulders [Music] wiggle your fingers and your toes and when you're ready open your eyes back to the world around you wonderful job today the more you return to this practice the more you replant these beautiful positive messages and energies within your subconscious continue to return to this practice time and time again for your highest most loving good thank you for being here dear love we're so grateful for the work you're doing that ripples out to the world around you sending so much love you  English (auto-generated)

air a light emanating or maybe nothing at all but just a feeling of love a feeling of life force energy and you feel a pull within your heart to receive this love to support you in both your stillness and your flow in both your being and your becoming tune in to how you feel you know within you that this loving energy this life force will assist you in both aspects of being and becoming stillness and flow and when you're ready you find a big bold button inside of your machine and you have an intuitive knowing that when you press it doors will open and love will come flooding in when you feel ready take a deep breath in and on your exhale press the button feel the doors of this spherical vehicle opening wide and on your next inhale feel yourself receiving the love from the universe the love that's all around you feel it flowing into your heart into every cell of your being and as you exhale feel it flowing throughout you settling in imagining that the breathing in is the flow is the becoming and the breathing out is the stillness the being [Music] sensing love entering into both of these aspects of your life and as you tune into your hearts energy center you discover that just as you've opened the doors of this vehicle so too have you opened metaphorical doors in your heart feel and tune into an openness in your heart a receptivity to love a receptivity to compassion to self-forgiveness acceptance and understanding affirm to yourself i am here i am me i am love and with that the vehicle quickly closes its doors teleports you back to where you are right now you feel yourself in this present time and space perhaps moving your sit bones from side to side to really feel yourself angered down and you tune in to how your body heart and mind feels right now there is an increased flow of love and receptivity towards love towards compassion how in both aspects of your being and your becoming there is love if you feel cold you may place both your hands on your heart as you say thank you thank you thank you carry this feeling with you as you really take your time and you slowly begin to roll your shoulders wiggle your fingers and your toes and when you're ready

0 Welcome to SoothingPod’s meditation. In this meditation, we will be exploring  defensiveness as it presents itself in our own   being. This is not defensiveness that arises when  we need to physically protect ourselves; rather,   it is in relation to the defensiveness that comes  up when we feel misunderstood or criticized. Note that this meditation will include  a visualization of past defensiveness,   so if there is past trauma in relation to this  theme, another meditation may be better suited. To begin this practice, take a moment  to find a comfortable seated position. Relax your shoulders and straighten your  spine as you close your eyes to settle in.  Draw your attention to the breath as you take a  few silent moments to arrive in this practice.  Let the mind come to meet you where you  are by noticing the earth beneath you…  … the air around you… …   and any feelings or sensations  that are moving through you.  Simply note what is here and then come  back to the breath to anchor yourself.  Each breath brings us back  into the present moment,   as long as we are fully attentive to its flow.  If there are any thoughts or stories  continuing to loop through the mind,   take a moment now to soften the forehead and  your eyebrows, easing this area of your being.  It’s also helpful to remember,  as we move through this practice,   that it is natural for the mind to wander.  Anytime you notice your attention has drifted,   just gently bring it back to your breath,  to your body, or to the words spoken here.  And now take just a few more moments to  mindfully anchor yourself through the breath   before we begin our exploration of defensiveness.   Liken the breath to steady waves coming  into and out of the shore of your body.  Let’s now consider the words of Gary  Chapman. In his words, “Defensive   behavior is a barrier to communication.” And it is true: When we go into defensive   mode, we contract, which stifles the  possibility for meaningful connection.  But what is defensiveness  really, and why does it arise?  To better understand this tendency, we can  consider defensiveness as part of the body’s   fight, flight, or freeze response. When we  perceive we are being threatened in some way,   it is only natural that we  try to defend ourselves.  When we are faced with imminent danger, this  response is helpful and even necessary. However,   when we defend ourselves habitually against  other people’s views, needs, and expressions,   we fuel the divide between us.  We might consider that our defenses arise  largely due to our past conditioning,   which explains why I might feel defensive about   something entirely different to what  would cause the same reaction in you.  The more aware we are of our own defensive  tendencies, the easier it becomes to soften   this response where it is safe for us to  do so. And instead of this inner defense,   we might cultivate greater compassion, curiosity,  and openness to the words and feelings of others.  As we ease any tendency we have to be defensive,  our communication with others improves,   our relationships get stronger, and  our capacity for growth flourishes.  To practice this, take a moment  to come back into the body.  Notice whatever is physically present for you now,   and where possible, see if you might soften any  tightness or contraction you may be experiencing.  Observe the breath that flows through you. Let   each inhalation create more space  for compassionate exploration.  Now, compassionately – and with curiosity  – consider a time when you reacted   defensively to something that someone said. Without judging or defending yourself in   your mind, simply note what it felt like  in the body to go into a defensive mode.  And as you hold this scenario  in your mind without judgment,   see if you might let the breath  flow a little bit deeper.  Soften your jaw… your shoulders… or any  other area where tension may be present.  Draw your attention to the heart space now,  and take a moment to cultivate a sense of   self-love in the face of whatever  led to you to contract and defend.  When we hold ourselves in unconditional self-love,   we are less likely to react strongly in the  face of criticism or differences of opinion.  Now, consider if, in the face of something that  makes you want to defend your inner world, it   is possible to become a bit more curious – about  both your own reaction and the words of others.  Consider if it might be  possible to hold differing views   at the same time without resentment or judgment.  Consider how harnessing compassion – for both   oneself and others – might ease the  defensiveness that arises within.  And now, continuing to hold your  attention on the heart space,   take a few moments to repeat  the following words in silence:  I love myself unconditionally. I am open to new perspectives.  I am willing to learn and to grow.  I am calm in the face of criticism. I communicate with curiosity and compassion.  I love myself… unconditionally.  Take a few final moments now  to let all words dissolve   as you hold onto this sense of  self-love and compassion for others.  Come back to your breath, minding the  ebb and flow into and out of the body.  Ground yourself back into  the seat or floor beneath   you… …   and when you are ready, you may  slowly let your eyes flutter open.  I hope you enjoyed today’s session. See you again.

0 So, welcome, everyone to our Saybrook University and Mindfulness Moment! I'm so glad to be here with you all. So, for this time that we're together, I invite you to get cozy, and we'll be spending this time in inquiry. So, maybe you would like to grab a journal or a notebook if that feels right to you. If not, that's okay too. Just simply arriving as you are and engaging in this experience. Just holding this meditation in your mind's eye and just bathing in response. So, as you settle in and maybe you are grabbing for a journal. Maybe a pen or pencil. We'll just preface this experience. So, tomorrow, we're experiencing a full moon and I often like to reflect. Spend some time reflecting around what that means for myself and also for us as a collective. So, there's a certain energy that comes with this full moon and with every full moon as we're shifting from one moon cycle to the next. Here we are, moving through Spring. We're really shedding those days of Winter, and we're growing through Spring. We see growth happening around us, and there's a real core energy that comes with this time of year I think. So, one that calls us to find balance to create harmony and to attend to relationships. So, for me, that also means attending and acknowledging to relationship with disharmony. So, noticing how you relate to other people. How you relate to your community and recognizing differences between defensiveness versus receptivity. How are you moving through your life? How are you moving through change in your life? Is there pushing or fighting or burning of self maybe? I'd like to think of these periods that we go through as shedding of ourselves. We shed, kind of releasing old patterns of thinking or behaviors that no longer serve us. Kind of move into a growth edge. So, what I'd like you to continue or to begin or really consider here is how are you shedding what no longer serves you. How can you do this in a way that holds yourself more deeply? Kind of allows you to move through change and discomfort with dignity and self-respect and to more clearly see the opportunities for growth. Profound growth. So, again, just however you would like to be right now. I'll drop in a few questions into your awareness and then hold some silent space for you to explore in your journal or through writing or if you feel like you just want to sit in still awareness. So, however you would like to be right now is perfectly fine. Again, just calling yourself back into just thinking about what are you shedding? What are you letting go of right now and how are you moving towards your growth edge? So, as we let go of parts of ourselves, there are some things that we want to hold on to. So, here this question really being that I want you to sit with: what are some characteristics you love about yourself and want in every version of you? So, I'll just say that again. What are some characteristics you love about yourself and want in every version of you? I'll just hold some space now for you to move through dialoguing about this or just sitting with that in your own body and mind. So, maybe jotting down or even considering a few more aspects or qualities or characteristics that really make you YOU. Shifting now. I'll drop in another question for you to silently consider or to express onto the page, which is: what skins am I shedding? We're talking about this letting go and moving into new growth. So, what skins are you shedding? For example, something that comes to mind for me and where I'm at is a shedding of the hustle mentality. This go-go-go Westernized mentality. So, again, what skins are you shedding? Just allowing yourself to bring awareness to this in your mind's eye. Maybe allowing those words to format onto the page. Holding all of this with kind awareness. Acknowledging that shedding of old skins, and it's not easy. It's not easy and there can be some resistance that comes up with this as we're metamorphisizing. So, now shifting again. Shifting your awareness to now considering how you can support yourself through this change and how you can support yourself through your difficult times. So, are final question to consider that I'd like to drop in here is to ask yourself how do I desire to be loved? This is a two part question. How do I desire to be loved and how can I love myself the way I desire? I'll say that again. How do I desire to be loved? First thinking about that. How can I love myself the way I desire? So, allowing yourself to consider what you write down anything else that feels meaningful for you here. So, now as we begin to bring this inquiry practice to a gentle close. Just allowing yourself to really sit with whatever meaning or insight that might have come forth from this experience. Taking with you what feels important and maybe you had been closing your eyes if you were just bathing in that still awareness. If so, just allowing yourself to come back into this space that you were in. Refocusing on what's around you. Just acknowledging that there are others who are gathered here in this experience with you. Sharing this meditative space. So, maybe something came up for you that feels important. So, you might choose to speak from a place of experience or perhaps you would like to not say anything at all. Just be with that experience. So, you might choose to remain here as long as you'd like with a sense of presence. Allowing yourself to come back and together we will share in the fruit of practice. Thank you so much everyone for being here today. May you all be well.
0 welcome to doxy meditations I want to share with you the true and incredible power we all have inside us the power to manifest anything we want human progress throughout history resembles something similar to a staircase there is a long period of time with no significant progress just straight steady and stagnant with very little change to human life then all of a sudden something astounding happens a near vertical jump in the advancement of humankind occurs a Leap Forward Leap Forward that instantly improves the lives of every single person on this Earth changing the trajectory of the world forever path of stagnation followed by instant and massive growth has repeated itself all throughout history but why does this happen it's actually very simple when you think about it all these dramatic advancements to human life occur when there is a breakthrough Discovery or invention that changes the world these are simple things that we probably use every day or even take for granted the invention of the wheel allowed for much faster transportation and trade the printing press allowed literacy to expand rapidly throughout the world the discovery of electricity and light bulb is something we use in nearly every aspect of our daily lives the discovery of penicillin has saved countless lives and has changed the field of medicine forever the internet has changed how we live our very lives revolutionizing communication and allowing everyone access to virtually all the information in the world instantly giving each and every individual more power than any king or queen in history ever had before its existence I believe this stair-step pattern of progress is a universal part of life not just on a scale of the entire human population but also for each individual all of us go through stages of stagnation where it seems that no matter what we do we can never make progress no matter how hard we try we are just Out Of Reach to that next level we are desperately grasping for whether we are grasping for more wealth Better Health a loving relationship a great career we find ourselves stuck in the mud motionless until something magical happens something that occurs in our lives that changes everything something that catapults us to another level it's easy to believe that this is mere random coincidence but I assure you it isn't it is something that can be controlled and used in your favor allowing you to make Leaps and Bounds of progress in your life rather than staying in that stagnant State sitting back waiting for something good to miraculously happen in your life as I look back at my life there have been several of these magical moments these moments of absolute transformation and growth I realized that all these occurrences have come when I have used the law of attraction I can honestly say that every dramatic Leap Forward in my life has been because of the law of attraction from first finding my passions in life to eventually Landing my dream job going from the daily worry of a nightmare of huge debt to an abundance and continuous source of wealth finding the home of my dreams finding the woman of my dreams every major Leap Forward in my life occurrences that have changed my life forever have all been because of this incredible power I want to share with you the techniques I use to manifest these incredible leaps of progress in my life so that you can experience this as well so that you can dramatically change your life for the better so that you can finally create a life that you thought was only possible in your dreams you will do this all as you are falling asleep it's that simple sleep meditation will open your powerful subconscious mind to suggestion where you will inject your intentions and visualizations of what you want to manifest from there your subconscious mind will take over and attract to you exactly what you want and it will all seem effortless it will seem like magic like you are truly in a dream as everything you ask for so naturally falls into place and comes into your life I challenge you to listen to this sleep meditation every night for 30 nights and see the Miracles that begin to appear in your life so when you are ready close your eyes relax and let's begin as we begin this meditation take a nice relaxing deep breath in and relax preparing the body and mind for rest and relaxation but before we go any further I want you to set the intention for this meditation what are you going to manifest into your life for it right now and be specific now I want you to just let that go as you take another relaxing deep breath in breathing in as long as you can then hold it for a moment now let it all out slowly foreign s completely pushing out all that air squeezing all the air from the body now releasing everything right now now you can just relax and let go as your breath gently and naturally Moves In and Out of the body feel how the entire body has become instantly and deeply relaxed as all the muscles release going completely limp notice how a relaxed body allows the mind to relax as well letting go of any and all fears or worries or doubts letting go of all thoughts completely as you take another deep breath in hand out feeling as your body and mind begin to transition into the realm of your subconscious mind so deeply relaxed now you can feel as your mind's eye opens looking around with your mind's eye you can see the dust all around you from the barren landscape swirling and blowing around what you see in every direction is a vision of scarcity though just a little ways ahead you can see the face of a giant sheer cliff needing to tilt your head back as the cliff appears to be a mile high soaring into the beautiful Starry Night as if the mountain itself or reaching for the Stars so relaxed now so comfortable a wonderful feeling begins to grow inside you like a voice calling to you pulling you to what is on the top of that mountain you cannot yet see what is at the top but that feeling inside you is telling you exactly what is up there you know it you have been guided to this spot for a reason exactly what you want exactly what you asked for is up on that mountain you have already manifested it and it is so close it is right there in front of you all you must do is reach it as you look up at the treacherous face of the cliff most would believe it to be impossible to reach the Pinnacle of this mountain but a feeling of belief of faith deep inside you begins to guide you closer and closer you come to the face of this mountain you reach out your hand and begin gliding your fingertips across the sharp rocks suddenly you are sent a vision a vision of what is on top of this mountain you can already see yourself at the Pinnacle of this mountain all the way at the top feeling as if you are in the present moment you have manifested exactly what you asked for you feel amazing knowing that you manifested it into your life and then a flash of a hidden stairway pierces your mind you now know how to reach the top of this mountain a way has been shown to you continuing to Glide across the mountain with the palm of your hand you can feel as part of the wall gives way and crumbles around your outstretched hand the small Gap around your hand slowly expands until a large opening is revealed to you and what you see in front of you is a stairway that leads up all the way to the top of the mountain your faith your belief has been rewarded there is a way there is a way to the top you know that there is always a way and as long as you believe that way will be shown to you patiently yet deeply excited to reach your desires you climb up the stone stairway the higher you climb the more relaxed your body becomes the higher you climb the more excited you become to reach your destination you begin to see the Lush trees Peak above the horizon you can hear the crystal clear water of a stream gently flowing above you your Paradise awaits you it is so close that you again begin to visualize yourself reaching your destination where everything you asked for has manifested into your life these Visions seem so real creating an even deeper sense of Desire inside you your feet begin to move so swiftly below you climbing higher and higher until you finally reach the peak it is so beautiful it is exactly how you envisioned it what you see now is a world where you have manifested exactly what you asked for see it now interacts with this world and see how it interacts with you what do you see how do you feel it is happening now you have manifested exactly what you asked for see every detail in front of you now knowing that you have manifested it thank you have the power inside you to manifest the life of your dreams you have done it see it and feel it now relax into these feelings and images it is happening right now when you are ready you can just let it all go You Can Let It Go knowing that your

0 hello and welcome to inspired meditations this guided meditation is called embrace a growth and success mindset 95% of our thoughts are repetitive if that's any indication of how we live our lives we repeat a lot day in and day out the problem with this is we begin to settle into a groove without growth and to be successful to achieve your goals you need to do something you haven't done before and think in a way you haven't thought before most people remain stuck in the same old patterns and limited beliefs and thoughts rendering them the same old results and lack of growth their goals have changed but their mindset has not and they repeat the same day even a tree planted firmly in the ground finds a way to grow it grows up and toward the sky your thoughts and beliefs impact your reality if you're currently operating on a fixed mindset old thoughts or you've hit too many dead ends you may think is is it or be convinced this is it please give this guy to meditation to listen don't settle for what you already have and nothing more when you are desiring so much more aren't you the least bit curious about what you are capable of new growth and successful thought patterns are something you can achieve with this guided meditation if you are ready and I believe you are let's begin settle yourself into your seat like you've never settled before go ahead let loose what have you got to lose give yourself permission to relax you can say to yourself permission to relax permission granted permission to slump over restfully like a sleeping dog or napping cat you will be relaxing and learning here and relaxing while you learn learning things for your benefit your growth your personal success just get really nice and comfortable committed to this process you are preparing to alter or enhance your current mindset in your favor instead of forcing it like you may be accustomed to by willpower or waiting on motivation you will settle into it easily naturally and almost effortlessly like easing into relaxation now no need to force it relaxation happens differently for everyone often the mind or the body resists pulling back just a little or a lot this resisting is a silly habit you can feel free to let go of at any time because what you really crave his deep relaxation whether you resist with a tense body or busy mind let me assure you it is natural it's better to release the urge to control the resisting than to push back do not resist the resisting let it go let nature take his course and let relaxation find your body ultimately either your mind or your body will release it first releasing the effort it takes just to relax instead it will resist the effort it takes to resist and simply give in to the feeling of complete and comfortable relaxation the kind of relaxation that soothes your mind and your body you may be wondering how much easier would be to just relax nestled in your protective corner of your mind wherever relaxation occurs for you loosen up your neck and shoulders wiggle or slouch into your seat [Music] now is a good time to take a deep breath in and exhale releasing tension release whatever it is you're holding on to feel yourself relax deeper on the exhales another nice deep breath in through your nose and exhale releasing relaxing deeper into relaxation settling deeper into your seat checking whether your mind or your body feels more relaxed right now is your mind settling into the background or your body releasing tightness whichever it is see if you can notice it now and make a mental note of it body relaxed mind relaxed any and all relaxation is progress as you achieve a state of peace [Music] take one more deep breath in through your nose really enjoying the process like a vacation and exhale let the tension deflate out of your shoulders your back your hips all the way down to your legs relaxation cascading down through your entire body washing over you soothing and effortless your breathing becomes regular and easy finding a natural rhythm for you gently closing your eyes if you haven't already quieting the mind pleasantly distracted with a simple game of counting backwards starting with 100 down to 99 imagine the numbers in your mind as you count down 98 97 96 down to 90 watching the numbers go down drifting down into deep relaxation still counting [Music] down further still counting your way backwards and to relaxation and soon you spend less effort on counting and simply watch the numbers drift on and on and you can lose track of them if you like now at this point accomplishing just the right amount of relaxation for you releasing the numbers let go of any efforts now while you take this time to relax and learn in a special way for your growth your personal success and to see farther beyond what you have ever seen before listen carefully and diligently now that you are relaxed in your own way I can let you into a sacred space of growth one that will contribute to your personal success you can almost feel it now relaxed in mind and body you can let these learnings soak into you flow into your inner knowing listen now to this universal truth people grow evidence shows all people can purposely change and grow throughout their lifetime leading to positive effects both physically and mentally you can grow the hand you were dealt is just a starting point for development I wonder if you know you can grow through mistakes and setbacks too that's called learning and the more you learn the more you can do and the more knowledge you take with you to apply to your future success you can grow because you recognize your accomplishments maybe some you haven't noticed before you grow because you feel moved by possibilities ignoring what you think is impossible you can say I'm exploring this and just trying things out you have a GPS navigation pointing you towards something good at all times like an inner compass you can now see golden opportunities thanks to your focused growth mindset that you continually develop and expand unexpected events and happenstance leads to new opportunities you now recognize those opportunities considering changes you've always wanted to make they show up as a reality in your mind now the seed is planted for things to be set in motion learning from your difficulties every success story is sprinkled with difficulties learning in this meditation so that you can apply it to your life learning from the process of growth in order to grow your personal success discovering and focusing on your definition of success regardless of external influences learn and never forget or take for granted the lessons they are valuable beyond measurement this is your recipe for growth and now I want you to see what growth looks like open your mind up to your imagination I want you to see growth to see it presented to you through five doors just ahead of you imagine what those five doors look like you scope them out before approaching perhaps they are monotone and unassuming or colorful and eye-catching are they made of wood or metal or any other door material notice all these doors appear to be closed from a distance but as you come closer step by step you experience an open minded attitude open to possibilities open to good changes open to learning a special invitation awaits you from behind each door you ask yourself which of these doors looks the most open to me what more do I want to experience open any door and investigate any number of opportunities waiting for you keep this in mind you have infinite possibilities for growth in your life you have infinite ways of achieving your personal definition of success you may not continue to seek out what every door offers you develop the knowing and intuition to leave a door behind when it no longer serves you there are plenty of opportunities limitless invitations to grow begin to open doors in your own life step by step day by day you open yourself up to new ways of thinking and expanding your gaze beyond what is just in front of you there are always doors for you to open opportunities up ahead some doors will be there for you to learn others there to encourage you and even others will direct you somewhere else better suited for you and your goals you are open to opening the doors open to opportunities and growth that is rewarding open to possibilities open to learning developing yourself in your life day by day finding your way to your personal success noting that even your most basic abilities can be developed with dedication you discover something new about yourself each week and often that you can apply to your goals you learn something each week and

and grow as you apply meaning and dedication to the areas you wish to develop success to you takes on its own meaning and definition and significance for you when you enter now into your new and

memories people places times in your life and as each and every one of these farts or emotions that tie you to the past comes up you simply notice it without grasping or clinging or rejecting and you give thanks for this experience for this fall for this emotion this person in your life is event in your life and as your heart fills with gratitude for this thought this event this person this situation this emotion he begins to dissolve and it begins to move further and further away from you moving back into the blackness of space no longer resonant with you no longer associated with you as you thank it and watch it become smaller and smaller in the distance disappearing dissolving thoughts of I can't I'm not good enough I'm sick I'm not worried I'm gonna lovable I'm guilty I'm wrong I'm bad and as you thank each and every one of these thoughts the emotions associated with these thoughts the people the places the times associated with these thoughts as you think and as your heart opens they move further and further away becoming smaller and smaller dissolving into the blackness of space I need turn every time that one of these thoughts beliefs fears people places situations memories each time one comes out you think it you open your heart and you watch it completely dissolve release back into the blackness of space no longer identified with you no longer tied to you no longer part of your experience because you choose to let it go letting go of the fears of limitations letting go of the pain the hurt the suffering back into the blackness of space and as you continue your journey into this open infinite space you notice a beautiful light pure white light very shiny very bright and you feel pulled to it attracted to it and as you connect to it you recognize it as your intention the most meaningful thing that you want to achieve in your life right now whether that be having a mystical experience achieving abundance success in your life in your career harmonious

tracks are about going within we will begin within it has been stated by many wise ones throughout history that we are vibrational energetic beings we are going to start the process of awareness of the unseen part of ourselves and from that powerful place we will manifest our desires by using our thoughts and our feelings getting right into that feeling place when manifesting is like

0 allow yourself this time to find a comforting  balance and centeredness within yourself find a comfortable spot where you can  bring focus and attention for this time begin by breathing gently in and out as you start to take notice  of your pattern of breathing just allow your arms and legs to release any  tension let gravity pull them gently downward continue to feel that gentle breath in and out   and again bring your focus and attention to it your chest moving up and down slowly and comfortably and on your next breath as you breathe out just let  your limbs relax even further releasing any of that remaining tension during this time you may become  especially aware of your senses.   the feeling of the surfaces you're touching  against the amount of light in the room you may hear detailed sounds that may have  otherwise gone unnoticed and all of these are fine just allow yourself to experience  these and accept them without judgment just take that time to find the  centered feeling of the present moment as you become increasingly  aware and increasingly centered you will become open to contemplate our  topic of focus for today being the boundless finding acceptance and being your best self What does it mean to become the boundless? It  means to unlock what we already have within us   it is to find acceptance within  ourself and with our surroundings   and ultimately it is to make way  for our best self to shine through. we will now do five short affirmations or  short phrases which you can repeat after me   either out loud or in your head and then we'll  take a moment of silent contemplation to reflect   let's try this now repeating after me and  allowing yourself to become more and more present   here in this moment as we count Five: I welcome this moment Four: I become present Three: I open my heart and mind Two: becoming my best self One: becoming the boundless when we talk about being present, it does not mean  that we cannot actively learn from our past and   future it means that we avoid the unconscious  clutter and noise that fogs our true path looking forward actually means being present  but with a purpose just as when we are walking   we understand that each foot is placed one in  front of the other with a clarity of purpose   of being successful through that clarity of mind  cutting through the noise of our unconscious mind. And so, with these ideas present we once again  count using our affirmations starting now. Five: I welcome this moment Four: I become present Three: I open my heart and mind Two: Becoming my best self One: Becoming the boundless Great! Now as you go forth embrace  these ideas to anchor yourself in the   present while learning from your past and  looking ahead into the future with purpose. you understand how failure is a teaching tool and  how we must learn from it yet also let them go you understand how to embody success to  clarify your goals and connect deeply   both within yourself and others  and you understand what it means   to be the boundless to become your  best self and lastly going forward   we remind ourselves to be grateful for  the earth for good fortune for good deeds we take all of this with us as we move  forward into the days and weeks to follow And so, counting one last time  with numbers only we prepare   to finish this session and continue forward with  a powerful new mindset becoming the boundless becoming the boundless counting five four three two one  English      
0 a mirror to the divine this meditation is based upon the teachings of dr. Joe Dispenza karma killer John Jones and our principles and practices of hypnosis and mystical meditation it is designed to help you recognize your own divine nature and help you decide enta PHY from any ego parts that may be experiencing fear beliefs negative emotions or states of limitations so begin when you're ready by finding a comfortable place where you can either sit or lay down [Music] [Music] once you're comfortable and relaxed you can close your eyes as you close your eyes feel the heaviness of the muscles around your eyes the muscles around your eyes are so relaxed and heavy that even if you wanted to open your eyes you couldn't allow yourself to have this time of quiet of relaxation and begin to send a wave of relaxation of the same nature as the relaxation of the muscles around your eyes throughout your entire body from the top of your head all the way down to your fingertips and to your toes as you continue to relax your body you sink deeper and deeper and deeper into a state of inner peace and relaxation as you sink deeper and deeper into deep relaxation you become aware of the space around your body the vast emptiness of space around your body and as you allow yourself to become aware of that space your Werner's of that space expands reaching further and further away into space to the sides the front the back of your body now in the vast emptiness of space imagine feel or visualize yourself traveling down an ancient path and as you travel down this ancient path you find yourself in the middle of a forest aware of the space around you you move deeper and deeper into the forest and somewhere along the path in the forest you see little clearing while light is shining and you decide to go and explore is clearing in the middle of the clearing there is a little pond [Music] you gently approach this pound and as you approach this pond you can see the reflection of your own self on the surface of the pond as you look and observe the images or simply feel it if you're not seeing it maybe you see images of yourself younger older in different bodies different lives and you just observe maybe you see projections of your thoughts your emotions your personality reflected on the pond and you're simply observing these images being projected on the ponds as you observe these images or feel them become aware of the feelings the sensations that are associated with them without clinging or grasping simply noticing the emotional charge whether you feel happy or not whether you're having a judgment or not as all of these images and projections of self are reflected on the pond now as the images continue to appear and disappear send each and every one of them love from your heart placing your awareness at your fourth energy center on your heart and the space around your heart filling the space around this energy center as you observe or feel these images and the associated emotions with them continue breathing through your heart feeling sending love to all of these parts all of these projections of self on the surface of the pond [Music] as you continue with this process keeping your awareness at your fourth energy center your heart center opening your heart breathing through it connecting to the feelings of love you feel lighter brighter more relaxed more connected to your divine nature less and less identified with the images the projections on the surface of the pond loving each and every one of them into the light of pure consciousness [Music] dissolving merging back into oneness now there are less and less images being projected on the surface of the pond upon this serene flat reflective of light and as you see this light you recognize yourself in the light [Music] you recognize that the light is a reflection of your own soul your own divine nature and you connect to the beauty of this light it's magnificence you recognize yourself in the light of pure consciousness and you know that all of these images all of these projections of self are constantly in the process of merging back with the right and as you gain this insight is understanding your heart opens even more and as your heart opens more you see this reflected in the brightness of the light that is reflected on the surface of the pond the more your heart opens the brighter the light and the brighter the light the more your heart opens [Music] and you become aware of this dance between you and the divine between your heart and the light of pure consciousness and what would you like to see reflected in the pure light of consciousness on the pond what qualities what elevated emotions would you like to see reflected would you like to connect to as you connect to the feelings of all of unconditional love of joy a pure love for life a deep sense of freedom and lightness wholesomeness what are you connecting with what emotions how are you choosing in this present moment to connect to pure consciousness what aspects of the divine are you embodying that you are seeing reflected in the pond in the light and as you recognize those aspects of the divine within yourself your heart continues to open and you feel these deep sense of gratitude for this experience for this realization realizing that you've always been one with the divine and that you will continue to be one with the divine for the rest of eternity feeling inspired by this moment feeling grateful for it in all of it you decide that you will come back to this pond anytime you feel the desire to anytime that you wish to see yourself in your true light anytime that you may go into self judgment self blame or criticism you will go back to this pond and allow yourself to see yourself in the true light of who you are feeling enriched by this experience he decide to go back on this path where others have worked before feeling light feeling free with your heart open you find yourself back in this room you find yourself back in the space where you first started this journey back in your body a new body a body that is filled with the light of the Divine her body that is aware of the miracles the healing that can be achieved in the presence of pure consciousness and in this new body in this new time in this new place as you come back you remember all of the insights and understandings that you gained through this experience and you remember your true nature and the pact you made with yourself to come back to this pond to come back to this realization of your true nature anytime that you feel lost hurt in pain or in the illusion of being separate from the divine from your true nature feeling grounded in your body you can begin to deepen your breath feel the flow of energy moving through the entire body from head to toes awakening you bringing your back in this space and time in a new body feeling recharged energized in love with yourself in love with your divine nature when you're ready you can gently open your

0 welcome to a guided meditation for focus for studying on the clutter of the mind let's start the practice by finding a comfortable seat you can practice this meditation right where you're planning to study so it can be on a computer chair or seat in the library or in the bedroom or in the office and just ensure you're sitting with your back upright but comfortable and resting your hands in your lap let's start with our eyes open and taking in a few big deep breaths breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth and now if you're doing this meditation in public such as in a library or school [Music] you can keep your eyes opened for the practice just maintain a soft gaze looking downwards otherwise you can close your eyes here and allow your breath to return to a comfortable pace and let's start by reflecting on the reality of our distraction-filled world there's so many things competing for our attention but we ultimately have in us the ability to maintain control over our minds and our attention so let's start by setting an intention for this practice in your mind repeat the following may i have a focused and energized meditation session and now let's turn our attention to the breath most of us don't notice that we are breathing all day long we simply forget that we are breathing we're so caught up in our days and thoughts it just sits there in the background without us noticing so let's bring our attention to the breath and notice the sensations around breathing and you don't need to change the breath here just allow the body to breathe on its own and notice it watch the rising and falling sensations around the body with each inhale and exhale and when you inhale naturally picture yourself breathing all the way down into your toes feel as though the air travels all the way into each one of your toes on each in-breath and notice as you do this as you watch the breath and maintain this visual thoughts and feelings may arise and attempt to pull your attention away from the breath just like distractions in the world that attempt to pull your attention away while you study but we can notice distractions just like we notice the breath and when a distraction arises we don't need to engage with it or follow it with more thinking simply allow the distraction to come and go through the mind and then return your attention back to the breath and now imagine that when you inhale you are breathing all the way into each fingertip imagine the feeling in your hands as the breath extends all the way into each fingertip and again if you find that the mind has become distracted or lost in thought if it's planning or thinking about what you'll be doing after the practice don't become frustrated or attach more thoughts to these thoughts simply notice it as a distraction allow the thought to dissipate and then return your attention to the breath and now i want you to bring your attention to how you are feeling right now notice how focused or unfocused you are in this moment there's no judgment needed just be with whatever you notice and when it's time to focus and study all we need to do is calm the mind and ground our attention our goal is to keep our mind with the task at hand and let it enter a flow state on its own we just need to create the internal conditions to allow that to happen but this also means creating the right conditions in our external world so this practice focused on our internal worlds but outside we need to mute our phones close out all other tabs use tools that allow us to block social media and news sites create the conditions both internally and externally for a successful study session and now let's close out the practice by setting an intention for our studying session and for the rest of our day so in your mind repeat may i have a focused and productive study session may i be undistracted and concentrated may i be committed to my studies may i focus effortlessly and now open your eyes you've just completed the practice for studying thanks for sitting and may you have a focused and productive day you
0 hello welcome take a moment to settle in relax as we begin a journey through time your eyes and breathe i am your guide we are traveling through time tonight whatever time of day it is for you adjust and return when you are up to speed and ready for a wonderful journey towards incredible peace solitude and healing i'm now going to count down from 10. each number we are becoming more and more relaxed in our bodies and awareness you should feel quite lighter ten nine eight seven six [Music] five for becoming more and more relaxed three more relaxed bring awareness to your body too going now to the most deepest relaxation we have felt in meditation one we are here now at the bottom of the relaxation scale we will remain here until the meditation and guided journey to atlantis has concluded until that time remain grounded and relaxed let's turn up that imagination now we are now ready to journey together through time discovering many unique visits and sites along our way i want to take a moment now and thank you for joining us along this journey together in a journey of discovery and healing my dear friend and soul the best journeys are accompanied by friends and guides we cannot do it all on our own we are all helping each other along the way and you will soon find that even you begin turning into a guide yourself towards the ending of this journey which is really just a new beginning now that we are on this lower level one of the relaxation scale we are now tuning our minds and our imagination directed towards this enlightened healing journey imagine now a time portal in a room this time machine is eternal and has the ability to take you anywhere you choose this time machine will always be with you wherever you go you'll be able to see it but no one around you will as it remains in multiple dimensions at once we use a cloaking mechanism for this beautiful time machine so fear not gather some thoughts now on where you'd like to go stirring up this imaginative real reality i am your guide so i will direct us appropriately the goal here is to find the palace and ruin of healing i've heard this place of healing is located in the city of atlantis where anything is possible let's choose to go there now i've routed the time machine for ancient atlantis step in to the time machine now the door is closing and our opportunities fading [Music] you'll notice the inside of this time machine is very pressure sensitive so as the pressures begin to change don't worry about that it's normal strange visuals and sounds now accompany your presence you visually see what the travel portal wants to reveal before your arrival awesome we have landed [Music] the door opens now step [Music] out [Music] now this is the real deal this is what we call the wonderful ancient atlantis [Music] so [Music] a true sight now isn't it walk along with me in this place the people have fully harnessed the limits of mind bending them and allowing the imagination to run a little wild in good ways mostly the ancient temple i heard is 1 000 years old foreign species and cultures have harnessed the inner powers inside for centuries the cool part is we are allowed in due to the unlimited tethers of parallel dimensional realities made possible by the inventors of this time portal we can go anywhere and honestly do anything we want we just need to get you healed though as it is my mission to keep this journey moving along steadily as we walk past these rather strange enlarged monuments notice the changes in color these are vibrations that have been intersecting with foreign frequencies view this as a intersection of crossroads but rather energetically they are alive actually living it is said that at the intersecting point here it has a higher intelligence than the combined universe this energy its multiple energies they notice all and see all but no worries we are allowed here if we weren't our time portal would have collapsed us into deep space [Music] yeah notice those animals quite rare you see lions with foxes half human half rhino here in atlantis they have experimented with crossbreeding anyways that's for a later conversation it ended up getting them into some trouble with the planetary councils until now no culture has lasted this long with such ability here you are healed instantly these rooms and towers actually accelerate learning ever see the movie the matrix it's like that but much faster and expanded that person over there they just spent 1 000 years on the solar planet necronian learning how to capture time continuums in order to spawn new suns in our multiple different galaxies sounds like a walk in the park right but she was actually present the whole time these portals are like contracts if you begin one you are lawfully tied to remaining there only the most experienced souls enter these types of contracts all right enough scaring you let's see here there is the ruin of all energetic healing doesn't look like much that's because it is cloaked to look like a simple cave in reality this is a portal to endless possibility and potential power it is said to hold all of the knowledge of the great creation and beyond this is where it is said that life first began shall we let us go come through this dark room holds all the answers imaginable any answer i know it's rather cold in here but they'll take really good care of us every inch of this underworld is lined with unique malleable consciousness in terms we understand that thought creates and spawns whatever you like it out imagine whatever you wish [Music] all right come on here we enter the forbidden staircase it's called that because many foreign rulers and energies have tried entering without rite of passage those souls are said to be held within small pebbles around the walls and floor everything has life here and i mean everything just watch your step it sees you and i and it knows all possible outcomes anything we think it knew prior to us thinking so just be aware there it is the pool and fountain of all healing quite large and bright it is lined with intelligence far beyond our capacity to understand i will never try at least as a guide this is where i stop wander this place for a moment and i'll still be here but only my voice now you are in a different dimension than i just watch the pools beside you very intelligent they are [Music] [Music] yeah over there step up on those stairs leading to the circle of healing don't yet step onto the water also don't worry about the colorful magnets or lights spinning overhead [Music] the washing process as they call it will erase all past resentments and karma from your energy [Music] it has to do with frequencies basically it frees you to do more with your life often souls come here if they can no longer progress through time they live in constant fear remember it's your intention that manifests here nothing else the power can only do what you allow it to all right that's the signal those lights do this now step into and under the open shower head clean water is now rinsing you from head to toe cleaning any and all debris and baggage of self-imposed limitations this rinses you clean of all impurities of bodily illnesses fears doubts and disbeliefs all worries it carries them all away quite the sensations aren't they [Music] oh i've been here more than a few times it's why i help people like you it's fully rinsing every inch of you from all pain and sorrows any stuck energy is now released by this purification definitely effective [Music] that shower stopping is normal that means that you have washed away all the impurities within yourself there you now stand there you are my lovely soul friend walk with me now over here back to the time portal i know it's a little hard to see we're actually in here already walk a little further time works a little bit different here that sight there that's your body this meditation was a pleasure truly revisit often i'll always be your guide and friend to help you solve life's ongoing worries you wouldn't believe how many different spirits and souls i see journeying here to find rest well it's now time to go back and rest my dear one take this adventure and new enlightening perspective and share it i must now return to the other portals i hear many beings calling ciao [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
0 good morning and welcome to your practice i'm sarah raymond from the mindful movement and i am truly honored you have chosen to allow me to be your guide this meditation is designed to empower you if you are feeling stuck overwhelmed and anxious and if you are motivated for change yet feeling limited by your beliefs today is a new day and a new opportunity to gain clarity in a time of personal growth i invite you to make yourself comfortable choose a relaxed seated posture with your spine upright if possible [Music] perhaps on a cushion on the floor a chair against a wall or on a couch close your eyes if you'd like or simply soften your gaze start to shift side to side gently in your seat feel the movement of your attention from one side to another move this shifting upward to your waist then see if you are able to move the wiggle up to your ribs [Music] and then shoulders then maybe even a small movement side to side at the height of your neck and then your head take a deep breath in through your nose then let out an audible sigh exhale as you settle into stillness become aware of the feels in your body the sensations perhaps you sense a buzzing or tingling as the energy from your movement continues yet your physical body becomes still as if there is a momentum within you that takes a few moments too slow take another few deep breaths at your own pace continuing to settle [Music] inhale through your nose and let out an audible exhale a sigh or ha sound or perhaps make a humming noise on your exhale [Music] noise creates vibration in your throat and it is effective to help you relax and regulate your nervous system [Music] after a few cycles let your breath return to its effortless rhythm invite a softening of your outer layer to wash over you perhaps you might imagine the removal of armor put there to protect you yet here you are safe it is okay to let go of this armor for a bit or consider what it might feel like to blur your edges as if a camera lens is changing focus you are still you you are safe you are simply letting go of the rough hard edges as you continue to relax and soften in your mind visualize a doorway or an entrance of sorts this can be a doorway you have been to before or one that exists only in your mind [Music] this may show up as a memory or as if it is a picture in your mind [Music] if nothing specific comes to mind simply use the idea of a door this door represents your opportunity to grow to move forward to make the change in your life that you desire this is the metaphorical threshold you may be having trouble crossing in your own life perhaps something related to business a relationship your home life a creative endeavor [Music] as this image becomes clearer in your mind you can also see yourself in front of this doorway [Music] as you witness yourself standing in front of the door that you know leads you to the next step in your life you see that you are holding many items in both of your hands it becomes clear that you cannot open this door unless you are willing to put some things down breathe slowly and continue to relax and connect with the feeling that you are safe these items you are holding represent any and all beliefs obstacles or responsibilities that are holding you back knowing that you must let go [Music] in order to open this door consider what needs to be laid down breathe in and exhale letting go letting go letting go as you let go sense the weight being lifted the lightness wash over you consider these questions to help you let go what is no longer serving you [Music] what is standing in your way is there a story you have been telling yourself that is holding you back from the change you desire the answers to these questions may show up for you now or sometime in the future be open be [Music] curious now is the time to let go of anything that may be holding you back from making a change you desire [Music] let go of any negative beliefs you may have about yourself visualize yourself putting down the limiting beliefs so they can no longer hold you back and now consider what is a new belief about yourself that would serve you [Music] better you

0 hello and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to cultivate a positive mindset before sleep and one that will empower you in the days to come my name is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to open your mind and soften your heart as you prepare for this journey just to begin finding a comfortable resting position that will be conducive of sleep and support yourself with any blankets and cushions you might need and close your eyes as you settle in ensure that your neck is aligned with your spine and let your limbs surrender into the surface beneath you and I invite your mind to fully arrive in this moment by tuning into your physical body and just note what it feels like to be in your body and to be supported by this place that holds you now drawing your attention to your breath minding the unconscious stream of life force that continually flows through you in order to breathe there is nothing you need to actively do the breath is guided by an innate consciousness that supports the life in all of us so simply observe it simply pay attention to its effortless presence watch the way it flows in and watch the way it flows out if at any point during this meditation you notice the mind has drifted into unrelated thoughts simply guided back towards the words spoken here or to the anchor that is your breath now before we move into a visualization to cultivate positivity before sleep let's take some time to harness the power of the breath because even though we do not need to control or engage the breath in any way in order for it to function we can consciously direct the breath in various ways to support deeper healing for instance as we mindfully invite the breath into the belly we initiate the body's relaxation response and interfere with the fired flight freeze response that can chronically take over our lives we can also use the breath to consciously cleanse ourselves of any negative thoughts or beliefs that impede with the experience of vitality and empowerment to practice this just take a couple more natural mindful breaths at your own pace and after your next exhalation I invite you to imagine that as you inhale you take in a bright white light from the universe that surrounds you and as you exhale imagine any mental or emotional debris leaving your body inhale the white healing light of the universe and exhale any heavy stagnant or negative energy that may be holding you back from being or that you are continue breathing in this way for a little longer and as you do I invite you to be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout this process we are all subject to experiencing negative or limiting thoughts and feelings so if it feels that negative energy has been culminating in you recently know that this is nothing personal and in fact it is nothing bad or wrong rather when we become aware that we have been holding on to negative or self-limiting energy we are blessed with the opportunity to move beyond it awareness of negative energy in this way acts as a catalyst for deep transformation so take just three more for cleansing breaths now inhaling light and exhaling any heaviness or darkness and after you finish that third exhalation let your breath come back to its natural pace depth and rhythm having established a groundwork of inner light and positivity let's begin our journey into a visualization of positive transformation so take a moment to draw your attention to the mind's eye honoring this space within you for its incredible capacity for visualization clear away any images or ideas that might be held here and on the empty canvas left behind I invite you to imagine that you are standing in a wintry forest somewhere not far from the outer reaches of the Arctic Circle the sky is dark and a deep silence permeates the forest snow covers the ground and though it is cold out you are well bundled and prepared for this journey standing with your feet firmly rooted into the snow packed trail beneath you you stand tall and take a deep full breath into your belly and they let it back out another long deep breath into the belly and then back out and you take a third and final breath in of this crisp clean pine infused air and let it all go with a sigh you begin now your journey on the path ahead you tread slowly and mindfully open to the wonder of this remarkable midnight landscape as you walk through this quiet uninhabited land you feel a sense of the infinite possibilities of the universe stars and the moon that shined down on you from up above remind you of the magic and mystery of the cosmos the cosmos that you are an integral part of all of the world's challenges and your own challenges seem to fall from your shoulders as you make your way through this vast and natural landscape it may not be that the difficulties go away completely however your fear and resistance to these challenges diminishes with each step you take across the forest floor in their place confidence courage and a positive outlook on life arises you continue to weave through the pines and spruce trees though it is quite dark your eyes are well adjusted thanks to the help of the glowing full moon above you are not quite sure how or why you've arrived at this place but you sense that you were being called to take a step back from the gritty details of life and to consider yourself your life and the universe from a fresh perspective here in this near Arctic forest you find space to breathe and indeed you begin to develop a clearer broader view of things a leap away from the day-to-day routines and habitual modes of thinking the weight of the world you've been carrying dissolves here in this forest you feel yourself awakening to your divine presence and to the divinity that lives within all beings and within the earth itself you breathe deeper now letting each breath continue to cleanse any negative thoughts or beliefs that no longer serve you as you walk a little further through this enchanted landscape you begin to absorb all of its wonder beauty and blessings you take in the freshness of the snow that covers the earth and the treetops you relish in the sound of this snow crunching beneath your feet and you sink into the silence that pervades the entire forest absorbing the herbal aroma of the pine and spruce trees your mind is awakening to all of the details of this landscape and to the beauty in the simplest of things soon you arrived at the edge of the forest coming upon a small clearing in the land the small field is covered in snow and at the opposite end of it a cabin awaits you slowly you cross the field paying attention to the crunching snow of each step and as you arrive at this humble abode you discover a small fire pit just outside the front door that is cleared prepped and ready to be lit in the small shed just a few meters away from the fire pit you discover a small brass matchbox holder as well as a warm knitted blanket you grab both and head back towards the edge of the pit kneeling down beneath the starry sky you strike a match and set the bundle of twigs on fire you watch as the flame slowly consume these thin branches and then you place two logs atop the burning pile you wrap yourself in the warm blanket and then sink back into the wooden armchair in front of the fire [Music] the crackling flames pierced the silent night with grace you welcome the noise as it settles the soul and awakens the heart and as you rest here gazing into the amber glow of flames and coal you sense the possibility of transformation that rests before you this element you gaze into is the holder of new life bearing the capacity to alkalize parts of you that are ready for change fire ignites our personal power and calls us to new beginnings and so hearing its call you offer to this fire any negative thoughts stories or beliefs that hold you back from moving positively and courageously into the future you might consider beliefs that hold you back from experiencing positive loving relationships or you might consider those that hold you back from success and achieving your wildest dreams or you might reflect upon the negative thought patterns that hold you back from cultivating your greatest capacity the spiritual emotional and physical well-being whatever arises you offer to the fire what no longer serves you casting those limiting negative thoughts into the fire to be transformed when nothing else is left to be released you let yourself bask in the fire's warm glow your belly softens your shoulders relax and you compassionately witness whatever is now moving through you sometimes clearing out space for a more positive mindset feels exhilarating and empowering sometimes this process creates momentary confusion sadness or other challenging emotions whatever is present for you honor your experience by tending to it with patience and compassion just allow these waves to come and go it and flow you lean your head back against the upper surface of the chairs backrest and as you shift your gaze away from the fire and into the night sky it appears the radiant glowing alchemical Northern Lights neon green indigo and fuchsia bursts of light dance in the cosmos above you watching them play in the night sky you feel an immense wave of gratitude washed through you as well as a sense of magic and infinite possibility you realize that the world is much more than it seems and that even when things are dark there are always traces of light to be found from the fires glow to the stars and the moon to the radiance of the Northern Lights positivity is reflected back to you from all directions the openness confidence faith and trust that lives deep within you [Music] spend a few more moments here now watching the play of the light in the sky above these rays of neon light sweep the sky with grace joy and ease awakening you to those qualities as they appear within you in this moment held in the beauty of the natural world you realize that this life is a gift and that in each moment there is something wondrous to discover [Music] the light continues to dance in the atmosphere that surrounds you and yet you let your eyes land once again on the burning fire you come back to your breath back to your body and back to your heart and to help reaffirm what you've discovered here you take a moment to set an intention to live your life courageously confidently and with faith allowing positivity to guide your way now take a few final moments to bask in the beauty of this landscape and when you are ready take three long deep breaths as you let the imagery dissolve slowly return to the reality that holds you by minding your body and your breath [Music] note the surface that supports you and the air that nourishes you and let your body surrender to this transformative night and as you do allow the following affirmations to permeate your being as they enter your subconscious mind they will continue to ground your being in the positivity you conjured here tonight I am happy healthy and at peace I love and support myself unconditionally new opportunities

0 [Music] welcome this is Sarah Raymond thank you for listening to the sky did meditation to build a sense of appreciation and gratitude for your body during this meditation I invite you to deepen your connection with your body love your body for what it does for you daily without being asked and without asking for anything in return love your body in spite of pain in spite of imperfections and flaws love your body is a vehicle for living the life you wish and love your body as a means to fulfill your passions and purpose in this world our mind body soul and emotions are one and our body speaks our mind taking time to nurture your body will support your mind and nurturing your mind will support your body as well if there is a part of your body that is feeling pain or if your stress level is high invite a sense of love and gratitude into your body and mind as you tend to each part to nurture yourself as a whole during this meditation [Music] sometimes we unknowingly begin to identify ourselves based on our pain or physical limitations and by identifying with these areas of dis-ease we can hold ourselves back today be kind to yourself think loving thoughts and love your body let go of labels of past pain or disease as well as limitations [Music] and now I invite you to make yourself comfortable choose a position where you can settle into effortless ease allow your hands to rest easy and close your eyes if you wish maybe you feel drawn to deepen your connection and would like to place your left hand on your heart and your right hand on your belly choose whatever position is calling to you make the small subtle adjustments in position and muscular tension to relax completely and now take a deep breath in through your nose sending the breath all the way down the length of your spine and breathe out like a sigh through your mouth releasing any residual stress or tension let's do this together one more time deep breath in and sigh it out feel your body soften and relax as you enter the familiar state of relaxed introspective awareness and allow your breath to return to its automatic pattern during this time that you have set aside to care for yourself the world will go on around you there will be sounds around you and thoughts that come into your mind simply acknowledge them and allow them to be part of the background as you invite your awareness inward bring your attention to your breath as it flows in its natural rhythm without changing or forcing any expectation of what it should be notice its path notice its tempo and notice its fullness perhaps your breath is beginning to slow down and deepen as you relax or maybe you feel the breath becomes shallow or even pause momentarily [Music] whatever you're experiencing is perfect simply be with the sensations as they arise notice the movement of your body connected to your breath rhythm perhaps a rise and fall of the chest and abdomen flowing in connection with each inhale and exhale continue to practice sensing the breath for the next few moments of silence lovingly returning your focus if the mind follows a thought or sound into story inviting your attention now to move slowly and deliberately to your physical sensations begin at the top of your head and scan the sensations of your body from the inside with a fluid attention all the way down to the soles of your feet as your attention passes over each part of your body encourage a release a letting go of any tension once your awareness reaches your feet bring it back to the top of your head and begin again this time notice any areas of pain or discomfort and simply be with the sensations without labeling or telling a story of why breathe into these areas and invite a sense of ease and release notice if you skip over or avoid any areas and as you scan or feel judgment about a particular area welcome anything and everything that you are feeling and thank your body for its ability to feel [Music] let go of past stories or expectations you may have about your body simply send love to your body [Music] as you continue this flowing body scan practice begin to now bring a feeling of loving-kindness as your attention moves down your body feel a sense of gratitude towards everything that your body does for you automatically thank your body for its ability to digest food and turn it into fuel thank your body for releasing toxins for pumping blood for breathing and thinking and allowing you to move around [Music] appreciate your body senses that allow you to smell your favorite scent taste delicious food see the beautiful sights around you here are the most amazing sounds and feel the soft touch of a loved ones embrace for each and every part of your body gratitude and loving energy feel every part of your body skin bones organs and energy maybe even your heart beating you may find it difficult to send love to an area of chronic pain or disease that is okay do your best to be with everything that is part of you pain is still a part of you a part of you in need of loving kindness continue sending positive healing energy to those parts [Music] perhaps you are drawn to play the hand on the area of pain or an area that needs a little extra love or imagine a healing light bringing relief and positive energy to the areas of discomfort stay with the sensations a short while longer and reflect on the amazing ability and automatic functions of the body send gratitude and love to each and every part of your body your heart and your soul [Music] the more connected to your body and aware you become the more you see that your body speaks your mind and it speaks important messages if you are willing and hoping to listen for the rest of today and beyond practice loving your body and listening to your body's important messages begin to deepen your breath to awaken your relaxed body bring some gentle movements to your fingers and toes energizing your body taking your time when you're ready open your eyes thank you so much for listening I hope you have a wonderful day

missing or you're ready for a change whatever your reason I am glad you found your way to this visualization and exercise lao-tzu once said if you do not change the direction you may end up where you

take the steps to fulfillment and satisfaction this practice will give you an opportunity to design your dream life and clarify your values you will begin to develop positive habits and live intentionally and you can connect with your authentic self and let go of resistance let's start now with this guided visualization find a comfortable place where you won't be disturbed for the next half hour or so open your mind and your heart to the possibilities of a life of your dreams we will begin by letting go of tension and holding in our physical body so we can let go of holding on to expectations judgements or being attached to specific outcomes in our mind when your body is relaxed there is space for possibilities to arise you can more easily connect with your authentic self I invite you to make yourself comfortable making any subtle adjustments to your body to soften close your eyes and bring your awareness - the automatic process of your breath while noticing your breath begin to look inside yourself for anywhere you can let go of the tendency to hold on let the weight of gravity sink into your body to deepen your relaxation give in to the support beneath you allow relaxation into your body and peace into your mind once you are calm you can connect to your heart and invite the version of your wisest and truest self to come to the surface [Music] as your truest self surfaces I will guide you to relax even more deeply begin to breathe intentionally more fully and count your breath [Music] your inhale is one and your exhale is two counting up to 10 and then back down again stay with your breath count and allow your mind to begin to calm [Music] [Music] allow your breath to relax to its natural rhythm and let go of the counting with a relaxed awareness look for any areas of your body you can relax from the inside are there any places within you that you can soften [Music] since the soles of your feet release as well as your toes the tops of your feet and ankles allow this release to move up to your calves your knees your thighs and your hips [Music] continue to soften your stomach your back your chest and your arms welcome this relaxation to linger and extend at the area of your throat and neck as well as over your entire face [Music] your jaw and your scalp to feel complete ease in your body [Music] look for relaxation without the need to control allow ease to move over your body when it comes in its own time so it's not forced [Music] as you become relaxed I will guide you through a visualization this practice is not about perfection things may not feel aligned with the life of your dreams right now and that's okay [Music] simply work with what you have and begin to move towards what you want as you imagine this ideal life you may see vivid pictures in your mind or you may find emotions arising within you perhaps you have specific answers to some of the questions or they may come later connect with everything that is coming up for you today and open your awareness to possibilities as they arise in the future now in your imagination begin to visualize your ideal life see with as much detail as is available to you [Music] how does this future life look [Music] what are you doing what are you feeling in this ideal life [Music] who are you spending your time with if you could not fail what would your ideal self look like [Music] see what your typical day would look like in your dream life in vivid detail [Music] [Music] what feelings and emotions do you want to have more of in your life what are the values and beliefs that are important to you [Music] visualize both the outcome and the process to get there without getting attached to either all it takes is a thought to make a change you can change your life the moment you decide to change you choose to live life how you choose to live life you are not the sum of your circumstances you are the sum of your choices choose to live in alignment with what is truly important to you [Music] these feelings from your dream life are already within you you can choose to call upon the feelings anytime you can create any life you want your dreams are within your grasp when you choose to reach connect with what is showing up for you now breathe that in as you connect with your authentic self the self that is deep within you you can make choices that will align your life with what's most important to you when you intentionally choose more of what feels good and less of what doesn't situations and life events will feel right and offer more joy you'll experience a sense of flow in your life you might have a sense of profound clarity stay with this visualization of your dream life a little longer connect with your authentic self and any feelings that may be coming up for you now [Music] [Music] and now bring your awareness back to the surface and since the room around you once more invite in a deep cleansing breath filling up with the possibilities of new and breathe out fully letting go of old habits and negative beliefs take a moment to honor yourself and the time you have spent here today as the first step in the

0 take a few moments to sit comfortably ideally with your back straight and with your soles of your feet on the floor as we begin now with three minutes of focusing on our breath so we breathe in [Music] breathe keep this flowing if you need to just pause for a moment that's okay we're looking to do this for three minutes breathing in and breathing out and no space in between the in-breath and out-breath as we right now start to fill ourselves up with oxygen spreading oxygen to every cell of our body [Music] that's one minute if you want to take a pause take a pause for a moment feel alive become aware of what it's like to be more oxygenated oxygen is the fountain of your life of your existence and if you want to start again let's start again breathing in and breathing out breathing in and breathing out just the constant flow of oxygen spreading it to every cell of your body from your nose to your toes from your toes to your hands and from your hands to your heart and to your head and all through your body as you continue to allow oxygen to flow that's two minutes let's go for another minute if you want to take a rest for a moment that's fine are you ready let's go again breathe in that's perfect keep going another 30 seconds allowing yourself to feel great to feel yourself alive to be in the present moment beautiful just another 20 seconds focusing on your breath if your mind wanders it's fine just bring it back another 10 seconds amazing you are incredible that's three minutes now take a moment to think about three different things different moments in your life where you felt gratitude picture one of those things right now see it hear it feel it remember what you saw what you heard what you felt and imagine right now stepping back into that moment that's it feel the grateful flow coming from your heart into your head right through your body re-live it gratitude is so powerful and you can take that memory and just bring it to life as we move on to the second thing in your life that you're you're grateful for it could be a person it could be an experience that you had where you felt so grateful so much love love is this supreme emotion and we experience love when we feel gratitude see what you saw hear what you heard back then or feel what you feel when you think of this experience or this person emotionalize that right now in every cell of your body feel that gratitude flow yourself up right now bring the memory of the person to life better than ever [Music] as we now move on to the third experience or person that you feel or people that you feel so much gratitude for see it hear it feel it turn it up emotionalize it be inspired take control of your mind your body your emotions feel that power that energy flow allow your nervous system to get fired up and feel that flow and wear that smile as you train your mind like you never have done before and right now as you take those three things those three moments those three people whatever it is for you and put it all together and feel that connection between your brain and your heart allow yourself to feel more gratitude than you felt before give that gratitude a color and send that color to every part of your body as you fill yourself up and you take that feeling and you double that feeling and you triple that feeling and you quadruple the feeling to the point where gratitude is coming out of your body in front of you behind you above you beneath you everywhere and send that gratitude off to people who need it people you love people you care people you meet every day people all over the world as you beam gratitude out into the world the attitude of gratitude is one of the biggest things which makes the biggest difference to the world that's right and now let's think of three things in your life that you want to have happen things that you're working on pick one of them and see it in the future it doesn't matter how clear that is it's just an idea but what brings an idea to life is your ability to smile to feel grateful and to see that thing having been done with clarity with a sense of faith what is faith it's your ability to see what it is that you want to have happen even before it's done and feel that dynamic tension of being drawn towards the thing that you want to have happen in your life feel it be it become it as you right now focus on the next thing in your life that you want to finish or complete and see it as if it's already been done as einstein said reality doesn't exist in the outside world reality exists inside your own head and the people who achieve things are the ones who have the foresight like you have now to see what it is that you're working on having been completed you owning that thing that's it see it hear it feel it emotionalize the fact that you have already achieved what it is that you're working on give it more life give it more substance give it more meaning become one of the two percent of people around the world it uses their imagination the workshop that we have inside our minds and body the gift of creation and now think of the third thing or maybe it's one of the first two you're just gonna do it again it really is up to you something that you want to see done finished completed be grateful for the fact that you now are able to see this feel it and step into it like it's already been done you have this ability you're doing it right now feel the feeling of completion your ability to take an idea take the feeling like it's already been done and just just to get on and make it happen it's all about action emotionalize it feel that tension that is a positive tension that draws you towards where it is that you want to go you are amazing you are awesome well done take a few minutes once again to focus on your breath as we bring this little training because this is what this is this is my 365. this is you working on being the very best that you can be we have this old brain in an incredible body with a heart and for us to make our brains and hearts work together much more effectively we have to train train ourselves to thrive this is 10 minutes of your time your valuable time you make a difference take all of this bring it all together allow your whole body to come alive your mind your body your soul everything emotionalize it anchor it what i mean by anchoring it is take a deep breath in and maybe clench your fists or stretch your arms up in the air and allow yourself to feel this in every part of your body because the more you do this the more you'll feel wonderful the more you'll be able to access this because greatness comes in many forms but for me two of the greatest things that you can do is see where you want to go and hear it and feel it and be compelled to move towards it and then the second thing you can do is recognize that in every moment in every day you always have a choice between what happens the stimulants and the response practice this every day and

silent solitude there are to be no distractions this is a time for personal growth empowerment and development please avoid bright artificial light during this mental journey the presence of natural sunlight is perfectly fine some people prefer during this exercise lying in the grass on a sunny day experiment and find the environment that works best for you this may change from session to session depending on where you are and your mood there are no mistakes that can be made in this process no one is judging your performance no one is grading you do what works best for you you may begin with your eyes open or closed they may open or close during the meditation it's okay be relaxed do what comes naturally to you let's begin by becoming completely aware of our own physical body we will begin at your toes be aware of their presence but let them be totally and completely relaxed visualize each toe begin with your little toe and move centrally one by one to the big toe let them relax feel the tension of the day flow out of your body through your toes just relax now mentally move up along the course of your body acknowledging the resting position of your feet we often carry stress in our feet they serve to carry our bodies through the physical world let them simply relax completely and totally now we continue to move upward to our lower extremities the legs and the thighs these

fully with fresh oxygenated air be quiet in this process avoid excessive noise be at peace within your own body as it is at the moment care for your physical self embrace who and how you are right now

diaphragm on a count of four fill your ribcage gently expand as you do this let your spine lengthen gently and let go of all muscular tension sinking to the surface you're sitting or lying on feel the gentle pull of the Earth's gravity on your body feel the natural relationship between yourself and the reassuring force of nature this is a powerful experience finally consider your neck and your head in our neck and face we store stress and tension unclench your jaw relax your tongue relax your eyes gently elongate your neck without straining and let the back of your head sink with its natural weight into the pillow or cushion you are completely awake but totally at peace you are completely in tune with yourself now again for slow deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth

0 welcome back to your daily mini meditation today we're going to be meditating on the concept of in perfection both in ourselves and our lives and in the world all around us to get started going to sit in a comfortable position make sure you're in a place that you know you're not going to be disturbed for the next few minutes I'm gonna be sitting up nice and tall if you're able to do so in a seat without a backrest so that you are under your own strength to hold yourself up you can have your feet flat on the floor or cross in front of you and your hands resting gently on your lap or your legs just are you're going to allow your attention your gaze to be soft directly in front of you you're not taking in anything in particular you're not judging your surroundings or allowing yourself and your consciousness to become part of the environment now allow your attention to come into your breath your attention and your breath become a single thing you'll feel your body begin to relax muscles in your face neck and shoulders your torso your hips and legs and feet all beginning to soften and to relax now in the quiet of your mind want you to call to attention an area of imperfection something that is external to you this could be something in society the environment other people anything that is imperfect these things of imperfection surround us and is precisely in the imperfection that we find connection to them we are imperfect and as we often look for and dwell upon the imperfections of what surrounds us the things in the world we find the same reflected in ourselves we treat those imperfections externally with the same hostility that we find in our perfections internally each of these imperfections are opportunities for growth and for change and for improvement we can improve the world and we can improve ourselves but we must first lay down our weapons of hostility that we use on ourselves and our own imperfections that is the only way that we will be able to confront the imperfections of the world in an effective manner we accept our own imperfections without hostility and without judgment we understand that we are able to improve we understand that we are able to change and that we can do the same for those around us only after we've done so within ourselves I'll bring your attention back to your body and back to your breath allow your attention to surface in the sensations of your body and in your own time go ahead and open your eyes take note of the improvs connection that you have both with yourself and those around you we are surrounded and filled with imperfection these are all opportunities for grace and love and improvement and that's the role that we can play great work today I'll see you back here tomorrow

0 Allow yourself to be here, fully, in this moment. With your eyes closed... ...begin to connect with your inner world of thought and feeling. Gradually... ...let the horseshit of the external world fade from your awareness. If you find your mind wandering to other thoughts... ...don't let it concern you. Just acknowledge that all that shit is fucking bullshit. You’re here now, in this place, with your inner stillness. Those bitches can’t get under your skin. They can't even. Take in a deep breath. Now breathe out. Just feel the fucking nonsense float away. Take full, deep breaths. Breathe in strength... ...breathe out bullshit. Allow your breathing to discover its own natural, unhurried pace. If your thoughts drift to the three-ring shit show of your life... ...bring your attention back to your breathing. And with each breath, feel your body saying... ...fuck that... With passive acceptance, just allow distracting thoughts to float by. ...fuck that.... With each breath you take, your thoughts become lighter. And all the soul-eating cocksuckers just... ...fall away into nothing. Take a moment to appreciate the silence. Those assholes can’t piss all over a purity like this. You are weightless. Timeless. Without beginning... or end. Completely relaxed and free of thought. And as you slowly open your eyes... ...greet the world and everything in it with a new, beautiful breath… ...of fuck that.
0 do not listen to this recording whilst driving or whilst operating machinery only listen when you can safely relax and bring your full awareness to your own complete comfort oh this is Michael CLE welcoming you to this session this is the second of two guided hypnosis sessions which I have made for you to enjoy listening along as often as you choose and to assist you with a development of your personal athletic mindset this second session is intended for best listening during those moments of your rest and recovery sometime during the same day after you have performed your physical weightlifting workout these positive suggestions will allow both your body and your mind to relax and renew rebuilding now from your post training stimulation because you can trust that you are about to powerfully set all of your deeper Minds intentions towards your physical replenishment muscular growth and you're continuing athletic success and now I suggest that because this session will help you to quietly relax and repair it is not for those times when you want to get up and move around generating energy or activity those suggestions for muscle stimulation and energy boosting are given in the first companion recording to this second obsession now you begin close down your eyes just as soon as you wish and as you better relax and listen carefully to my words my voice can go with you as you will find that your commitment to these positive self suggestions will only compound and continue within your subconscious growing into your rest your recovery your nightly sleep and Beyond and now again bring your attention to your breath by starting to notice those slightly longer in-breath and the slower relaxing out breaths as you breathe in calmness and you breathe out all tension and breathe in health and breathe out everything that is not health calm and easily relaxing now it's really so simple to let yourself relax and go deeper just like descending a set of comfortable stairs going further down with each step three two and one going deeper and deeper into the very basement of your total relaxation now allowing each and every part of you to let go and relax as this time is the time for your body to release and further let go this time is the opposite time of tension or contraction as all lactic acid and that remaining residue of your physical muscular activity now simply flows out and away from you because time is about your body's moments of repair and replenishment all of which comes to you now with the internal flow of positive soothing comfort and as all of your muscles release just like a handful of loose limp elastic bands you know that the more your muscles relax and release the easier it is for all of those vital nutrients to flow into those healthy cells and the more you feel those sensations of relaxation developing the more you allow yourself to rest and repair and easily going deeper and deeper and deeper still and now imagination you can find yourself in the master control room of your own physiology find yourself now in the very central command of your body's functioning however you would like to imagine it and perhaps you might see a large operations room just like a space shuttle communications panel as you feel the vibrations of power resonating around you or you hear now those reassuring sounds of your total health and potential or perhaps for you it is more of a natural and organic space just like a warm cave covered with healthy mosses and leaves as healthy crystal water drips and echoes throughout these nurturing surroundings it's really up to you how to imagine your own bodies master control room always knowing that you have the power here to set your best positive intentions and now as you continue to rest and relax and further imagine your athletic progress you find that any negative aspects to your previous strength and muscle growth are now being eliminated just like the release with every deeper out-breath as that air flows out it takes with it all of those old limitations and negativity and with each passing day you find yourself feeling stronger fitter leaner and more and more muscular because you are adopting your own positive mindset and your own powerful outlook each day you experience a renewed sense of energy vitality and strength because you give now all of those commands directly to your master controlls and just by setting those directions you find you look confident because you are confident you feel strong because you are strong in each and every way you are taking the time to improve your workout performances always making sure to rest deeply when you need to rest and to train with focus and purpose when you choose next to train naturally easily your entire system functions in perfect balance and harmony and always you sleep well and deeply at night so that your body and your mind reflect your healthy outlook and because you rest so easily you find yourself rejuvenating after each training session always you are growing in more and more powerful healthier positive ways because you know that your true muscle growth occurs when your body is deeply here at rest and because you eat healthily you choose to fuel your body well so that all of your cells your nerves your muscles and deep fibers are all naturally renewed and they repair themselves automatically and when it is time for your weight workout to end you find that you take just a few moments immediately after to remember to really visualize your muscles best recovery and just by enjoying listening to this recording you are now planting the seeds to rest and relax and grow and I want you now to imagine and see yourself in your favorite recovery place really see yourself there hearing all of the relaxing soothing sounds around you and feel all of those sensations of comfort and support as you sit or lie down feeling calm satisfied and content and now imagine a point you're recovering muscular body a series of soft hot wet towels placed down over your recovering muscles placed there by the very best physical therapists in the world so that those towels are placed down onto your chest muscles and you now feel those chest muscles release and relax as they repair deeply and now back muscles feeling those Pleasant swelling sensations of growth beginning to occur and now your shoulders as you feel those towels placed down over all three parts of those deltoid muscles and now your arms as those towels cover your biceps and triceps and your forearms and now those towels are placed onto your thighs those quadriceps and hamstrings and / pleasant tingling sensations of growth simply happened now as those muscles deeply repair and now your car's feeling wonderfully good and now particular muscle group that you may choose you can imagine those towels being placed down bringing those sensations of warmth and comfort and allowing yourself to feel that wave of positive energy that is deeply anabolic and now direct your diva mind to feel all of those soothing healing sensations as those warm towels bring improved blood flow to each and every muscle in recovery credibly good to heal and repair in this way because you can imagine your entire physiology just like a giant transport system so that all available blood with oxygen and nutrients is now being sent to your recovering parts and growth hormone itself is now directly filling those muscles because those soft heated towels are bringing you increased muscular growth and now as you take this time to really enjoy this deep relaxation imagine now that you can easily step out into your future and take yourself to some positive time ahead of you and you can really see yourself now with those increases in muscular size that you have always wanted and really notice how you stand and notice how you move and feel yourself looking and feeling exactly how you wish your body to be because

very deepest DNA within you feel into each and every part of you with your best health and improvement always in positive and constructive ways and so you relax deeply if you are drifting off to sleep

wonderful if you're able to listen to it with headphones this mind programming process is not exactly the same asleep but you'll sleep while it happens there will be changes it is like daydreaming as you lay there as you begin to sleep you will let the words and music wash over you and you may find you don't remember it all consciously afterwards so I want you to lay down and make yourself comfortable now adjust the blankets and sheets comfortably so that you can relax you can close your eyes as soon as you wish if you awaken you will be fully alert [Music] I simply want you to go back through your day [Music] review your day from the beginning to end so that we do not bring anything that happened today into this dream space [Music] do not judge what happened just simply put it to roll through like a film [Music] thank you for giving me permission to program your mind through the sound of my voice your subconscious mind can clearly hear the commands that come from my voice [Music] your mind is programmed so that when you wake up you will wake up fully refreshed feeling as if you have gotten the perfect amount of sleep you will feel so good when you wake up remember the last thought that you think as you go to sleep will be the first thought that you think as you awaken the majority of this will be listened to by your deep subconscious mind find your solace and escape cleanse unwanted disruptions from your mind but for now you can just let go you are listening to this for a reason as you hear my arms and become aware of the sensations that allow you to relax more deeply at the end of this process you will have an inner calm and invigoration with a sense of refreshment so for now notice your breathing take a deep cleansing breath breathe into your whole butt into your stomach and breathe out and squeeze out that last breath of air let the air cleanse your body notice the gentle rise and fall of your breathing simply notice your breath and try not to control it but simply observe the breath without control gently breathe in as you focus your attention on your breathing my voice will go with you as you relax you will wake up refreshed and will

in your body any parts of your body holding any tensions or emotions you will let those go now as you begin to drift in this place where you control and can communicate with your subconscious mind [Music] you'll notice the fabric of the sheets and the blankets that wrap your body you become aware of the infinite sea of particles that you lay upon vibrating in perfect resonance to the dream that you are dreaming [Music] you can notice your pulse and the beating of your heart as you allow yourself to become more and more absorbed in your mind now start counting backwards from three hundred two hundred and ninety-nine 298 297 296 295 to 94 that's right it doesn't matter if you get lost [Music] or whoíve a bit out forget just start again at about the same place notice that you don't notice when you lose your place and drift off only when you return momentarily before becoming more absorbed so as long as that part of your mind is active it is fine that it counts when it doesn't that it doesn't count - you don't need to listen to this consciously your unconscious will hear all that it needs to hear I would like you to notice where you feel the most comfort in your body drop your shoulders and relax even more with each out and breath as your shoulders drop let that easing run down your arms and down your body let it even go low into your legs let that comfortable feeling all the way to your feet you can notice words notice noticing words and you can notice noticing your body can relax [Music] can relax your mind has become very sensitive to my suggestions that help you most your breathing carries on all by itself your mind carries on thinking all by itself you can just watch it wander away because your experience understand an awareness and just detach and slow down [Music] some people really like to relax in a warm sunny place beautiful clear blue skies relaxing sounds of the up and flow waves in the distance and the refreshing breeze the sunshine glinting off the ocean when you think about the rich anchored feeling of joy wealth and happiness that you get now by squeezing your thumb and finger together imagine taking that wildly feeling now into every area of your life imagine waking up every morning with this feeling of a wealth see what you will see and hear what you will hear and feel how good it feels feeling rich the daily life make it a feel as real as though it's happening right now [Music] you choose to be wealthy you take joy in the success of others because you feel comfortable with the money you are creative and money flows to you you're creating prosperity and your consciousness is prosperous you surround yourself with successful people making money is good and you enjoy your work your thoughts are energy and attract to you wealthy and prosperous experiences you now think more thoughts of happiness wealth optimist joy and cheer inner peace [Music] you are becoming richer every second with every syllable that you hear this very recording is making you rich beyond your wildest imagination [Music] I would like to talk to that part of the mine that is in charge of any limiting or self-sabotage patterns of thinking and behavior I'd like to ask your unconscious mind to find new ways to achieve all the positive things that you wrote for thinking used to do for you but do not involve poor thinking in the future take the time to find new ways now so that in the future it is natural for you to have rich thoughts and behaviors [Music] once upon a time there was a miser he was to hide his cold at the foot of a demon in his garden but every week used to go dig it up and gloat over his gains Robert would notice this went and dug up as you imagine now our wealthier pastor you set your financial thermostatic and

knowing as possible in this rich world in this alternate timeline that is now your timeline what would it be like to be a teenager having grown up from the moment you were born there was always enough money to do what on it do who would you spend your time with where would you travel to [Music] what kind of hopes and dreams would you have for your future how's cure and confident would you feel how

0 Welcome. Go ahead and settle yourself into  a nice and comfortable position. Sitting calmly and peacefully. Your posture relaxed yet alert. Rest your hands in your lap. And gently close your eyes. Now, let’s take a couple  of deep, soothing breaths. Breathing in through the nose and breathing out through the mouth. Breathing in and breathing out. One last time, breathing in, and breathing out. Now, allow the breath to settle. And just bring your awareness to yourself. Be mindful of your current emotional state. Accept yourself as you are,  right now, in this moment. And just stay here for a moment,  enjoying sitting with yourself. And think about the person you are today and place this current self in context with  all the experiences that have brought you here. So maybe you are a kind person. Think about what has inﬂuenced  you toward being a kind person? Maybe you are compassionate,  loving, or courageous. And just reﬂect on what has inﬂuenced you  toward being the person that you are today. And bring to mind your key  traits and characteristics. What makes you the person that you are? Is it your job? Your skills and talents? Your relationships? Your approach to life and your hobbies? Think about the words you  would use to deﬁne yourself. So just spend a few moments  getting to know yourself. And now, recall a time in your  past when you were going through   a difﬁcult transition or making a tough choice. Think about what you were doing and  how you were feeling at the time. Remember how tough it was to be in that situation   and attend to your past self with  compassion and understanding. And remember what it felt like to pull through. Think about how you handled the  situation or made the difﬁcult decision. Think about the growth you experienced. Congratulate yourself for going through  something that was a challenging time. And just take a moment to wrap yourself   in gratitude and acceptance for all  the hardships you have been through. To heal and to grow is to accept  hurting as part of being human. And now, repeat the following  phrases to yourself, ‘’I am doing the best I can with what I have. Sometimes I struggle and that’s okay. I will be kind to myself. I will be patient with myself.’’ Tell yourself that life is hard sometimes,  but you are always here for yourself. Every challenge in life creates  an opportunity for growth. Take a moment to appreciate your journey. And as this practice comes to an end, take your time to come back to your surroundings. Feeling the inner smile within your body. Begin to stretch easily.

take it all in [Music] the meadow before you is full of soft tall grasses rich in light greens and yellows spreading into the distance where the horizon meets the bright sky the temperature is just right and the air is crisp and clean as you gaze into the horizon there appears to be a subtle flicker in the distant sky a soft flash of light it's not alarming at all but it invites your attention

0 Welcome to Soothing Pod’s meditation.   In today’s meditation, we will be  exploring the power of vulnerability,   opening the heart lovingly to both  ourselves and to this innate human quality. To begin, bring yourself to a seated  position that is secure and comfortable. Close the eyes and allow   the muscles around them to soften… … and then check in with your posture. Ensure that the neck and the rest  of the spine form one straight line,   and then allow the shoulders to relax. Soften the stomach as you become  more attuned to your breath,   allowing it to flow as deep as is  comfortable for you in this moment. Now, take a moment to tune into any thoughts or  stories that may be trickling through the mind. They may be strong, heavy, and stubborn… … or they may be soft, gentle, and fleeting. Whatever the mind’s contents feel  like in this moment, see if you can   open your heart lovingly to whatever is here… … and then soften as you return to your direct felt experience in this moment. Notice the earth beneath you or the surface  supporting you… and notice any physical   sensations that may be present within. If anything uncomfortable is present, invite a loving, compassionate  breath into each of these areas. Take a few more moments of quiet space  now, just witnessing whatever is here   as you continually re-ground  yourself through the breath. What does it mean to be vulnerable? To be vulnerable is to be raw, honest,   and open; it is to be capable of loss,  hurt, and pain. It is to be fully human. Many of us hide our vulnerabilities, denying  wounds and avoiding failure, because they   hold much shame, guilt, and judgment. In a world  that often fails to go deep (or fears doing so),   vulnerabilities are seen as weakness – and  weakness is seen as something negative. However, if we open ourselves to the  possibility of being truly vulnerable,   we come into contact with its power. Because, despite any misconceptions we might hold about it, vulnerability is where our humanity shines through; and through it, we grow, evolve, and find strength. In the words of Brené Brown, “Vulnerability is the birthplace of  innovation, creativity, and change.” When we allow ourselves to be vulnerable, we  learn more about who we are as individuals   and as humans; understandings that  propel us forward for positive growth. Brown also explains, “Embracing  our vulnerabilities is risky   but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love   and belonging and joy – the experiences  that make us the most vulnerable.” Her words are an invitation for us to  honour and acknowledge our vulnerabilities.   As each of us is human, each of us  is vulnerable in a variety of ways. As we open ourselves up honestly and  authentically with healthy boundaries in place,   we deepen our understanding of  ourselves and our connection to others.   And, as we practice this authentic opening,  we invite others to do the same with us. Let’s explore this a little further,  diving into the inner world: Take a moment to tune in  once again with your posture,   opening your heart space to be  witnessed, nurtured, and respected. And then take a moment to consider what  vulnerability means to you – and to   reflect mindfully upon what makes you vulnerable. If fear-based thoughts arise during this inquiry,  see if you might speak compassionately towards   them, reminding them that you are in a  safe space to explore what rests within. To love is to be vulnerable. To  create is to be vulnerable. To   take leaps of faith is to be vulnerable.  Allow this inquiry to expand and deepen. And now, returning your attention to the  center of your chest – perhaps resting   a palm or two on top of your heart –  silently repeat the following words: I am authentic, honest, and true. I am willing to be all of who I am. Vulnerability fuels compassion,  creativity, and growth. Take a moment now to thank yourself for  showing up for this courageous practice. And then, draw your attention to  your breath for another cycle or two.   Notice the breath’s innate ebb and flow. Draw your attention to the earth beneath  you… and to any sounds around you. And when you are ready, gently open your eyes. I hope you enjoyed today’s session. See you again.  English (United States)       
0 hello and welcome to day 10 of the expand  meditation program today is a wonderful   day not only because it's the last day of  the program and you made it through the   entire program so far but it's also the beginning  and continuation of your own meditation journey   maybe you have found those last 10 days  really hard and it was very hard for you to   sit down find time to practice or maybe you found  it very easy and it felt all really good for you   no matter how the experience was know that there  is no bad meditation so you showed up for yourself   and you did the work which is all that counts  usually we have a next steps video at the end of   every single one of our programs but this can  all be summarized in today's video and of course   the message that we want to send to you is to  keep going keep showing up really just don't   stop every single day is a new opportunity to  connect to yourself to learn more about yourself   to connect to stillness within and you do that  through your meditation practice so although the   program ends today we highly encourage you that  you continue again tomorrow with day one and just   keep repeating the program we strongly encourage  you to follow the program and go through it   for at least 30 days so two or three times more  through the full program so that you really have   established a solid habit and something that you  can rely on in the flow of life you can always   come back to this practice it will help you ground  it will help you lift you up no matter what life   is throwing at you you always have your practice  to come back to to reconnect only because your   experience of this program was a certain way  for the last 10 days doesn't mean that it has   to continue like this for the next 10 days or for  the next whatever how many days it could be that   the experience was so far challenging and the  next 10 days will be super easy and smooth and   you feel incredibly good it could also be that you  felt really good throughout the last 10 days the   next 10 days will be very challenging know that  this is completely normal that the meditation   progress is not really linear it comes in  different stages and there's ups and downs and   the important part is to not compare your  meditation practice and experience as it   is today to something that was a while ago  sometimes even when you're meditating for   many years it could be that at a certain time in  a certain stage it feels like you just started   out again and you feel like the meditations that  you did several years ago but know that this is   all part of the growth and part of the process  so the reminder here to just trust the process   keep showing up and treat every meditation  independently enjoy every meditation as it   is and as it unfolds each day when you are ready  to begin grab your pillow set everything up find   a comfortable seat take a few deep breaths  and whenever you're ready close your eyes take the next few breaths or  so to connect to your body notice what you're sitting on the  connection and support to and from the earth from there lengthen upwards through the spine in the beginning of your meditation  when you just sat down it's the time   to readjust to move around so that you can  sit effortlessly throughout this practice this helps to set you up right in the beginning  so that you can be as still as possible throughout your session establish  that connection to your breath that is   it has become so familiar  now over the last 10 days because you continue to show up every day to  sit down and feel the breath feel yourself feel the life force that is  included in the air you take in that keeps all the systems  going that keeps you going as well as the plants and animals and all  the other earthlings on this beautiful planet we all breathe the same air you all see the same sun the same moon feel the same rain mother nature is ultimately what connects us all that connects all beings that means reconnecting to mother nature is reconnecting to everything  it's reconnecting to life reconnecting to yourself each and every day as  you sit down perhaps for the rest of your life by really making your meditation practice a really solid part of your day it is through that that you discover more  about yourself you discover more about everything and everyone around you and you can bring more quality into all  the actions you do throughout the day continue to lean back into that pure  awareness where you observe the breath if distractions come up let them be and let them go treat yourself with kindness that you noticed and refocus on the breath there are three qualities of awakened doing with awakening being the realization  that you are not your thoughts but instead your being your true  self is separate from the thoughts it is which has the ability to observe the  thoughts those three doings are acceptance which is you being fully present  surrendering and accepting to what is it might seem like a passive  action or you being passive but it's not to be confused with not caring it is actively choosing to be okay  with something that's currently going on although your first instinct  or reaction or from the outside it seems like not such a good thing whatever is coming  your way in life through presence you accept you're accepting life the second awaken doing is enjoyment enjoyment is not something inward   flowing towards you it's not something  found in the activities or in the doing or in the work or in your surrounding it's from the deep connection to yourself within that you feel this enjoyment and let it grow so that it then is outward flowing from  within outwards into whatever you're doing the doing itself is the purpose of the doing not to reach any goal or anything you're  working towards that is helpful but secondary the act of doing right now is all that counts the third modality of awakened doing is enthusiasm it is you finding joy and fulfillment in your actions so much so that you are just really excited about it all your enthusiasm is so strong that you  cannot wait to do more of what you're doing because you enjoy doing it if you recognize any of these three in your life then the awakening process has already started where you go deeper and deeper  to yourself to life to nature at this point you cannot stop the process anymore you can only delay it and by establishing a meditation practice daily you can cultivate those  qualities let them grow go deeper the plant has already started to grow maybe you see a little bit of it already maybe  not if you continue to show up to meditate   to breathe to be you are watering that plant as you continue your meditation  practice over the next days weeks months and years imagine how much this can transform you  imagine how much this can transform your life your relationships your work all this enjoyment and all this quality  outward flowing into everything else   around you but coming from deep within it's  important to reconnect to that source within as often as possible maybe someday you don't have to reconnect anymore   because you are constantly in this state  of connection this is the true liberation also called moksha but it's all about feeling it within you feel it a little bit within yourself  you felt that spark the process has started   continue to show up day  after day to water the plants let it grow and enjoy enjoy what is unfolding notice the air coming in through the nose and out to the nose the breath is always with you there are many opportunities  for you throughout the day to feel it to reconnect to take a few minutes of breathing in and  out nice and slow there is no upper limit to   how many times you can reconnect throughout  the day in addition to your daily meditation practice if you're waiting in line if you're  waiting for the train or for your taxi consider just sitting down or standing eyes open or closed and breathe just for a minute maybe for five it's about this reconnection several  times throughout the day which   will really rewire your brain and create stronger connections of love peace relaxation presence and authenticity the journey has just begun you know the door and it's up to you to go through it to continue this practice the path will appear as you walk it day after day step by step feel the connection to the earth again length now to the spine when you feel ready bring your palms  together bring the hands to the heart to be so so proud of yourself for  showing up over the last 10 days sitting down to practice to reconnect that  space within you has always been there   but it's sometimes covered up this is why we come back to the practice  to sit reconnect to who you truly are from here on it's up to you  what you make of this journey but you are worth it to go deep to feel the  love for yourself for others to be happy to be at ease i wish you the best of luck  love and support on your journey thank you very much for practicing with us today with love and gratitude namaste  English      
0 hello and welcome to inspired meditations this guided meditation is called embrace a growth and success mindset 95% of our thoughts are repetitive if that's any indication of how we live our lives we repeat a lot day in and day out the problem with this is we begin to settle into a groove without growth and to be successful to achieve your goals you need to do something you haven't done before and think in a way you haven't thought before most people remain stuck in the same old patterns and limited beliefs and thoughts rendering them the same old results and lack of growth their goals have changed but their mindset has not and they repeat the same day even a tree planted firmly in the ground finds a way to grow it grows up and toward the sky your thoughts and beliefs impact your reality if you're currently operating on a fixed mindset old thoughts or you've hit too many dead ends you may think is is it or be convinced this is it please give this guy to meditation to listen don't settle for what you already have and nothing more when you are desiring so much more aren't you the least bit curious about what you are capable of new growth and successful thought patterns are something you can achieve with this guided meditation if you are ready and I believe you are let's begin settle yourself into your seat like you've never settled before go ahead let loose what have you got to lose give yourself permission to relax you can say to yourself permission to relax permission granted permission to slump over restfully like a sleeping dog or napping cat you will be relaxing and learning here and relaxing while you learn learning things for your benefit your growth your personal success just get really nice and comfortable committed to this process you are preparing to alter or enhance your current mindset in your favor instead of forcing it like you may be accustomed to by willpower or waiting on motivation you will settle into it easily naturally and almost effortlessly like easing into relaxation now no need to force it relaxation happens differently for everyone often the mind or the body resists pulling back just a little or a lot this resisting is a silly habit you can feel free to let go of at any time because what you really crave his deep relaxation whether you resist with a tense body or busy mind let me assure you it is natural it's better to release the urge to control the resisting than to push back do not resist the resisting let it go let nature take his course and let relaxation find your body ultimately either your mind or your body will release it first releasing the effort it takes just to relax instead it will resist the effort it takes to resist and simply give in to the feeling of complete and comfortable relaxation the kind of relaxation that soothes your mind and your body you may be wondering how much easier would be to just relax nestled in your protective corner of your mind wherever relaxation occurs for you loosen up your neck and shoulders wiggle or slouch into your seat [Music] now is a good time to take a deep breath in and exhale releasing tension release whatever it is you're holding on to feel yourself relax deeper on the exhales another nice deep breath in through your nose and exhale releasing relaxing deeper into relaxation settling deeper into your seat checking whether your mind or your body feels more relaxed right now is your mind settling into the background or your body releasing tightness whichever it is see if you can notice it now and make a mental note of it body relaxed mind relaxed any and all relaxation is progress as you achieve a state of peace [Music] take one more deep breath in through your nose really enjoying the process like a vacation and exhale let the tension deflate out of your shoulders your back your hips all the way down to your legs relaxation cascading down through your entire body washing over you soothing and effortless your breathing becomes regular and easy finding a natural rhythm for you gently closing your eyes if you haven't already quieting the mind pleasantly distracted with a simple game of counting backwards starting with 100 down to 99 imagine the numbers in your mind as you count down 98 97 96 down to 90 watching the numbers go down drifting down into deep relaxation still counting [Music] down further still counting your way backwards and to relaxation and soon you spend less effort on counting and simply watch the numbers drift on and on and you can lose track of them if you like now at this point accomplishing just the right amount of relaxation for you releasing the numbers let go of any efforts now while you take this time to relax and learn in a special way for your growth your personal success and to see farther beyond what you have ever seen before listen carefully and diligently now that you are relaxed in your own way I can let you into a sacred space of growth one that will contribute to your personal success you can almost feel it now relaxed in mind and body you can let these learnings soak into you flow into your inner knowing listen now to this universal truth people grow evidence shows all people can purposely change and grow throughout their lifetime leading to positive effects both physically and mentally you can grow the hand you were dealt is just a starting point for development I wonder if you know you can grow through mistakes and setbacks too that's called learning and the more you learn the more you can do and the more knowledge you take with you to apply to your future success you can grow because you recognize your accomplishments maybe some you haven't noticed before you grow because you feel moved by possibilities ignoring what you think is impossible you can say I'm exploring this and just trying things out you have a GPS navigation pointing you towards something good at all times like an inner compass you can now see golden opportunities thanks to your focused growth mindset that you continually develop and expand unexpected events and happenstance leads to new opportunities you now recognize those opportunities considering changes you've always wanted to make they show up as a reality in your mind now the seed is planted for things to be set in motion learning from your difficulties every success story is sprinkled with difficulties learning in this meditation so that you can apply it to your life learning from the process of growth in order to grow your personal success discovering and focusing on your definition of success regardless of external influences learn and never forget or take for granted the lessons they are valuable beyond measurement this is your recipe for growth and now I want you to see what growth looks like open your mind up to your imagination I want you to see growth to see it presented to you through five doors just ahead of you imagine what those five doors look like you scope them out before approaching perhaps they are monotone and unassuming or colorful and eye-catching are they made of wood or metal or any other door material notice all these doors appear to be closed from a distance but as you come closer step by step you experience an open minded attitude open to possibilities open to good changes open to learning a special invitation awaits you from behind each door you ask yourself which of these doors looks the most open to me what more do I want to experience open any door and investigate any number of opportunities waiting for you keep this in mind you have infinite possibilities for growth in your life you have infinite ways of achieving your personal definition of success you may not continue to seek out what every door offers you develop the knowing and intuition to leave a door behind when it no longer serves you there are plenty of opportunities limitless invitations to grow begin to open doors in your own life step by step day by day you open yourself up to new ways of thinking and expanding your gaze beyond what is just in front of you there are always doors for you to open opportunities up ahead some doors will be there for you to learn others there to encourage you and even others will direct you somewhere else better suited for you and your goals you are open to opening the doors open to opportunities and growth that is rewarding open to possibilities open to learning developing yourself in your life day by day finding your way to your personal success noting

0 ﻿A Guided Meditation on the Body, Space & Awareness Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche Welcome! I’m very happy to share with you some meditation instructions. It is very simple: Please keep your spine straight. Just straight, but don't worry too much about perfection. I have to stay there, perfectly! Just keep straight. And please close your eyes. Just close your eyes like you’re sleeping. You don’t have to close them too tightly, or in any special way. And relax your muscles in your body. Relax the muscles in your head, forehead, face, ears, cheeks, throat, upper body, arms and hands, lower body, legs and feet. Just totally relax, yet with your spine straight. And bend your neck forward a little bit. It's almost like the weight of your head rests on your neck. You can effortlessly rest. Each part of the body rests on the one below. And in this way, you feel like you’re resting but there’s also some strength, so you can find balance. All the parts of your body are resting, one on top of the other. But, at the same time, there’s a strength within you. Your spine is straight. Sometimes you feel a little bit of gravity. And sometimes you feel some sensations. Just let it be. Whatever feeling is in your body, just be aware and let it be. When I was young, my father used to tell me, "Let your body be on the cushion, and let your mind be in the body." This way, you join body and mind together. Your mind comes into the body. Just be aware of your body, and be aware of any sensation or feelings in your body. Pleasant feelings, joy, bliss, or unpleasant feelings, tightness, pain, or neutral feelings, maybe tingling, or no feeling. So, with any type of feeling, just be aware and let it be. OK, for a few seconds, just be aware and relaxed. OK. Now, you can expand your awareness beyond your body, to what surrounds you. Maybe there are some sounds, or some smells, or some sensations, like your room temperature is a little bit too hot or cold, or some noise, like people chatting, or a car, a train, or airplanes moving around, or your neighbors making noise. Anything. Just be aware. Just know. Just recognize there are sounds. And your awareness becomes more open, and vaster. Stay there and be aware of any phenomena for a few seconds. Now, you can expand your awareness  beyond your immediate surrounding. Feel the space around you, above you, and be aware of that space. Further, deeper. All the phenomena are occurring in the space, changing in the space, dissolving back into the space. Like clouds, they come into the space, remain in the space, and dissolve into the space. And, now, you can expand your awareness even more. Go beyond the clouds, into space, which is boundless. Space, which is open in all directions, everywhere. Be there. Don’t worry, you’re not going to get lost. Stay there for few seconds. OK, now, please slowly open your eyes, and be present here. And rest your mind, also — not only the body. How do you rest your mind? For example: If you like to do physical exercise, like jogging in the garden or park, or hiking in the hills or mountains, maybe for a few minutes or hours... let’s say one hour... After you finish your jog, you may use a nice seat or a rock, or a grass field. Sit on the grass field and, with a big sigh, “Ahh,” just rest. You don’t have to meditate, just let your mind rest as it is and the body, also. Just rest... for a few seconds. Maybe you feel like, “Oh, there are so many thoughts, so many emotions occurring in my mind. What should I do with those emotions, those thoughts?” Same. Same as before, you just be aware. If there are thoughts and emotions, you’re just aware of thoughts and emotions, what I call “blah blah blah,” just look at the “blah blah blah,” be aware, and let it be. Same as when you’re aware of your body, aware of sounds and sensations, now it’s the same: Just be aware of thoughts and emotions. Let them come, and let them go. But, if you cannot be aware of them, it’s also fine. You're in a non-conceptual state of mind, but not too long — only for a few seconds. Again, when you see thoughts and emotions, or forms, sounds, smells — anything, just be aware... for a few seconds. If anything occurs in your mind, in your body, in your perceptions, just be aware, and let it be. OK. Now, you can apply this awareness, this openness, this awareness with any situation in your life, with any activities in your daily life. Short time, many times, everywhere, anytime. Seven days a week, 365 a year. In this way, you can fill your mind with joyful, peaceful experiences, and you will develop your inner love, compassion, and wisdom. Thank you!  English
