0 hello welcome to today's gentle movement practice for relieving stress and anxiety i'm sarah raymond with the mindful movement so just a quick overview of what we're going to be doing today primarily it's going to be seated so you can be seated in a chair or on the floor even on a couch whatever is comfortable for you and then the second half will be a little bit on the floor so if you're comfortable coming down onto the floor with me you'll join me if not then you just participate in the front first half of the practice so we'll start with a little bit of breathing and then some gentle self-massage techniques to bring some awareness to different body parts when you might be feeling anxious and need a little bit of grounding and then some gentle stretches to open up the area that allows you to deepen your breath and find a little bit more ease if you are experiencing stress or anxiety so let's get right to it so come to any comfortable seated position and we'll start with a four seven eight breath so it's an inhale through your nose for four counts a hold for up to seven if you don't feel comfortable with seven then you can do a shorter hold and then it's a slow exhale through your nose for eight counts and i'll count you through the first two and then we'll practice a little bit on our own so again finding any comfortable seated posture tall lifted spine shoulders relaxed and down maybe close your eyes if you'd like and then exhale fully as a preparation breathe in two three four hold two three four five six seven breathe out two three four five six seven eight again breathe in two three four hold two three four five six seven breathe out two three four five 6 7 8 now continue on your own so finish one more cycle on your own and then allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm normal depth and flow and then next we'll take three deep inhales through the nose and this time as you exhale create an audible sigh so do that two more times let your body soften and relax with each exhale blink your eyes open if they were closed okay so next we're going to move on to as i said some self massage techniques i'll take my glasses off here so we'll start with the facial massage and you're just putting a gentle pressure doesn't have to be significant you can use your fingers or if you have a tiny little ball that might work too but you're basically finding the bones in your face and pressing on the bones and you might just press along the bones or you can press and gently pull either outward downward upward whatever feels like it's the most effective for you we're not going to spend a ton of time here you can again close your eyes if you like and go against your nose at the cheekbone above your eye eyebrow i should say above your eyebrow your forehead and then i like to spend a good bit of time right at around the jaw so it's pretty much in line with where your ear is so you can find them there's a bone on the top and a bone on the bottom and then there's a little indentation and you can press there and open and close your jaw and then go around the jaw and then you would just of course do the same on the other side and if there's any areas that feel particularly sore you might just stay there and take a few deep breaths and like we practiced earlier when your exhale is longer than your inhale it can have a little bit of a relaxing effect relaxing effect for you you'll start to find the areas that feel like you need to spend the most time there and you can always just explore there so again find the jaw hinge of the jaw open and close okay and if there's anywhere that you feel like you need to spend a little bit more time you can do that otherwise we'll move on to our neck so you can use both hands or one at a time your choice you'll feel just behind the ears the bone start there and then start to work your way down and you can even go to this upper trapezius area so the top of your neck and shoulders and then let me show you from the back you're going to take one hand on either side of your neck so on either side of your spine i should say and then think of pulling outward and as you do gently let your head drop back and then come back up again so you'll go through that a few times right starting right at the base of the skull and then working your way down and then after you do that a few times you can um i like actually do this with the opposite hand so the muscle right at the top of your shoulder you'll grab with your opposite hand squeeze up draw your shoulder up towards your ear and then just release down squeeze up and release down one more time on the side and then we can switch sides so as you squeeze that muscle lift your shoulder up and release and all the time continuing to breathe fluidly good okay and then last bit of self massage will be the area of your chest so if you can find your collarbone at the top of your chest you're going to go just below the collarbone and you'll just give a little bit of pressure you can push in and then pull down gently and as you pull down you might explore turning your head in the opposite direction so you feel a little bit of stretch through maybe the neck at least so my my left side is always a little bit tighter especially at the neck here so i know i need that and then you might go down a little bit below the collarbone if that feels okay for you and we'll do the other side so finding the collarbone right below press in and feel free to either tip your head towards the opposite shoulder or turn your head towards the opposite shoulder maybe again go down a little bit below the collarbone okay and that will be all of our self massage today so next we'll start to do some very gentle stretches so again you can remain in any comfortable seated position arms by your sides and then we'll stretch through our neck here so you can begin by tipping your right ear towards your right shoulder i'll mirror you here and as you're tipping your head to your right think about drawing your left shoulder down away from your ear and then you'll draw your chin towards your right collarbone and then you can either stay here with your chin towards your collarbone or go back to chin forward whatever feels comfortable and then take your left arm out just um above the height of your hip i would say turn your palm forward and then you're moving from your wrist so you'll draw your fingers backwards and forwards a few times be gentle here there's no need to be aggressive with these stretches and then just allow your arm to relax down draw your chin toward your chest slowly and then your head comes back up and we'll do the same on the other side so nice and gentle tip your left ear towards your left shoulder encouraging your right shoulder to stay down and then turn your chin you can see i'm moving very slowly to make sure i don't go too far too fast chin towards the left collarbone and then as we start to add the movement from the arm you can again either keep your chin down or tip it forward but you're still bringing your ear towards your shoulder and then we lift uh let's see this is your right arm out to the side just a little higher than your hip and then palm facing forward as you move from the wrist fingers go back and fingers forward and you might start to notice if you're tensing up through the neck this might be too high so bring your arm down or make the movement from your wrist a little smaller and then relax your hand down slowly draw your chin toward your chest and just letting your head hang here for a moment take a breath in and out and then slowly bringing your head back up all right and then from here a couple spine stretches so we'll lift your left arm drawing your shoulder down and think about lifting up tall and at the same time grounding down and then gently side bending over to your right and now we'll start to add some movement but i want you to try to focus on keeping your left sit bone heavy on the ground so as you turn your shoulders forward towards the floor you're not lifting that right uh the right side of your butt up and then come back to center and turn your chest towards the ceiling and center now we'll keep doing that movement you're going to bring your eyes to focus on your top hand and then we'll follow the hand so you're looking forward as your shoulders rotate forward looking back towards the ceiling and then behind you one more time rotating forward looking forward rotating back and come through center and back up again all right maybe roll your shoulders around a few times and we'll do the other side so lift your right arm again lift tall first and root down through the pelvis and then we side bend over so as i said my left side is always a little tighter so i have to remind myself to draw that shoulder down easy in the neck and then begin to rotate shoulders forward and back and now adding the eyes so looking up at your top hand rotating forward just keep that top hand as your focal point one more time forward and back and center and up again okay so um this next part if you are comfortable lying down on your back i would recommend doing that if you prefer to be seated you can definitely do this seated so i'm going to take it down onto the floor and once you lay down you're going to interlace your hands and place your hands right at the base of the head now again you could do the same exact thing as seated if you prefer now if you have any shoulder issues uh if just one shoulder is not comfortable in this position you can just do this with one hand or if neither of your shoulders are comfortable uh overhead you can use a pillow under your head is fine so we're finding this sense of almost traction so my hands are at the base of the skull where there's two little bony points and i'm gently lengthening those two bony points away from my shoulder so that my neck is nice and long and then i'll relax my arms by my side so my head's heavy neck is relaxed and then i'm actually gonna do this without my glasses with your eyes only look as far to your right as you can and you'll just allow your eyes to stay in that position so eyes are looking as far to the right as you can without moving your head and then come back to your breath and we'll stay here for a few breaths if you feel a sense of release or relaxation response like a sigh or a yawn you can bring your eyes back to center if you don't quite get there then you'll just stay for a few more breaths and then bring your eyes back to center if they're not already and just blink your eyes a couple times you may have to repossession reposition your head and neck and then we'll do the same thing to the left so you're keeping your head still and moving only your eyes looking as far to the left as possible and then once you do that you'll keep your eyes left back to your breath and then just allow your body to relax so maybe scanning through physical sensations of your body to see if there's anywhere you could soften you know i tend to grip through my hips a little bit so it's helpful to relax there [Music] or maybe you could find a little more ease in your shoulders take one more breath looking left come back to center again blink your eyes and then you can close your eyes and take your hands out from behind your head relax them by your sides and then if you are uh laying on your back just bring your knees in toward your chest you're still seated you might fold forward over your legs just in essence giving yourself a gentle hug and take a few breaths there checking in to see how you're feeling okay and then releasing your feet back down or coming back to seated and then we're going to move on to laying on our belly so you'll roll over if you're on the floor come down onto the floor if you were seated and then you're going to be propped up on your forearms so elbows under shoulders if you can if this feels like it's too much on your lower back then you can take your elbows wider and if that still feels like too much you might go still a little wider or other option would be to be all the way down okay so we do want to be working to open the chest as much as possible so again you can take nice deep breaths okay so if you're on your forearms you're pressing down into the forearm to lift the crown of your head as tall towards the ceiling as you can and then you might allow your butt muscles and your legs to relax and then start to breathe into your belly expanding side to side front to back and as you're breathing out do your best to avoid sinking down into the shoulders okay so you can stay here or we're going to add a side bend so leading with your eyes look left side bend left so that means your left shoulder will go towards your left hip and you're looking with your eyes to see how far behind you can see maybe you could see one foot maybe you can see both and then come back to center and then to the other side so eyes first then the shoulders and then the waist and center now coordinating that with your breath so you can really breathe in either either pattern but i like to inhale as i side bend and exhale back to center keep thinking about the crown of the head lifting away from the floor and then last little addition here if you're comfortable with it is to add a bend of the opposite knee so as you side bend the left you're bending your right knee and center and as you side bend right you're bending your left knee so remember eyes are leading the way we'll do one more in each direction and then come down stack one hand over the other and you can rest either your cheek or your forehead on your hand and then take a nice deep breath into your belly and let it out we'll do one more belly breath here i like to do the belly breath on the floor like this because you can feel your belly expand against the floor okay and if you're comfortable on your knees in a child's pose position you can go there so you can either have your knees apart and your big toes together with your knees together and your big toes together hips back and then chest comes down now if your knees and or hips are not happy here just roll onto your back and hug your knees into your chest a few breaths again soften and relax the body okay and then we're going to add a side bend here so taking your hands over to your left ribs over to your left and then settling into that child's pose position again you might encourage your right hip to draw back your right fingers to crawl forward and then now as you breathe send your breath into the right side of your body from the armpit down to the ribs down to the waist and then take your time coming over to the other side so again drawing now left hip back left fingers forward using your breath into the left side of your body to create expansion to increase mobility of the ribs and the muscles that assist in breathing and then come back to center and back up again okay so we are going to do one more stretch to continue to open up the rib cage area again the muscles in between the ribs help to breathe or allow for a deeper breath so you come on to your side with your knees bent so they're going to line up with your hips and then your bottom arm can go out in front and if your neck is okay with it your head can come down if you feel like you need a little bit of a support just grab a pillow or a blanket or a towel and roll it up and then we'll start to lift the top hand towards the ceiling so right up over your shoulder again use your eyes to facilitate this so you're looking at your hand just above your shoulders and then start to bring your top shoulder towards the floor and that will allow your arm to go back keep following your hand with your eyes as far as you can and then eventually maybe your arm reaches the ground and if it doesn't that's okay but if it feels like it's strain on the elbow you can bend your elbow and just rest your hand on your shoulder so more importantly is that we're twisting through the rib cage here and the chest stretch is sort of a bonus there if you do feel comfortable with your hand on the floor all right once we have arrived in our twist you're welcome to close your eyes and begin to breathe into the area that feels like it's stretching the most for you so perhaps it's the rib cage or maybe it's your hip or your inner thighs whatever you're feeling is fine just send your breath there and encourage relaxation to come to you and then take your time as you start to unwind yourself back and then we are going to turn over and do the other side so you make your way onto your second side again knees are bent out in line with your hips bottom arm out in front head comes down and then you'll lift your top arm up towards the ceiling find the hand as your focal point and then your shoulder is the first to move so as if you're trying to get that top shoulder to touch the floor behind you which first folks it won't quite get there and that's okay so once you twist as far as you can you can always bend the back elbow and put your hand on your chest if that feels more supportive or you can let your hand rest on the floor closing your eyes if you wish and taking a few deep breaths scanning through your body noticing where you feel any restriction or gripping and sending your breath there okay take your time as you untwist and then you can use your top hand to press you up to seated and then as you come to seed it again let's uh do a quick check-in so you'll close your eyes let your arms relax by your sides first notice your natural breath after spending some time in self-care you might notice your emotional state after this short practice to help reset your nervous system and decrease stress and anxiety you might check in with your physical state notice the muscles around your eyes your jaw your neck see if there's a little bit more softening available softening the outer layer connect with this calm peaceful feeling know that is always within you within reach when you're ready gently blinking your eyes open so any of that can be separated out and used on its own so the four seven eight breath pattern the self massage techniques or any of the stretches to be used to help calm you down bring you you know back into your body if you're feeling uh moments of stress or anxiety and additionally i'll share with you a playlist of all of our meditation practices for anxiety so that you can pull one up

0 take a load off right now set yourself down and relax as best you can in this moment to fully appreciate what your mind is capable of changing [Music] through visualizing the sights sounds smells and feelings described you can alter how your mind perceives any anxious thoughts and sensations it may take some time and patience to see results but with perseverance in listening to this soothing meditation track on a regular basis your subconscious will realize that those situations that bring high energy and nervousness can be alleviated [Music] please make this time for yourself by setting aside an area where you can fully absorb this experience safely being comfortable and reassured that only good things will come take a moment to set the volume of this audio to a setting where you won't have to move and is not too loud to appreciate any lighting the need adjusting to create a calmer atmosphere and taking care of any otherwise distracting elements can be done there [Music] now is it time to be gentle with yourself you owe it to yourself your mind and body when tension builds and can be felt it can cause a chain reaction a snowball effect anxious feelings of a stirring and somersaulting stomach can lead to tension in the shoulders and other areas this then can lead to negative way of thinking and so the vicious cycle of these effects continue to drown out any positive vibes that you should be experiencing over time the confusion of what causes all these sensations and downward where your thinking gets a little fuzzy and trying to understand why you feel the way you do becomes lost [Music] as this meditation continues and you absorb yourself more you will begin to open up seeing understanding and realizing that perhaps you have become too hard on yourself [Music] there are a few possibilities of my anxiety sneaks up when you least expect it this can be from being too strong for too long guilt from the past or simply being in new circumstances there are many many more these are just examples you know help this quiet time to let thoughts feelings and sensations be shown in a safe and calm way where you are fully in control in a moment let the imaginative side of your mind take over as you begin to relax underneath your subconscious will be making notes readjusting things and compensating you with a more positive way of thinking gifting you with a karma mood whilst deeply relaxing your body [Music] now as she lays still and relaxed as best you can let your imagination begin to take over see in front of you a corridor and at the end of just a few steps forward is light take a break from your mind right now forwards and away from yourself into the light [Music] the dark corridor can be seen as the confusion that surrounds the mystery of your anxious feelings and where the light is projected from will perhaps provide you with answers to take back with you when you do return you can give yourself permission to bring back as much of this experience as you wish [Music] in the distance you see blues yellows and greens mixed in with a subtle warm overturn the shapes you see are moving slowly or very easy on your eyes as you get closer everything becomes clearer as you now see a beautiful fine sandy beach that soaks up the warm daytime Sun [Music] palm trees gently sway at the edge of this beach oasis whilst creating a soothing white noise has the leaves dancing the comforting breeze the sight of an aqua and blue ocean washes the smallest white waves as they spill onto the salt and sand which glistens like diamonds in the Sun the breeze is warm as it gently strokes the calm midday Sun onto your face and body relaxing you slightly [Music] as you walk from the shadows of the corridor onto this blissful Beach you fill your shoulders instantly relax and your face soften as if synchronizing with this calm atmosphere feeling the soothing effects of this oasis you turn and close the door to the corridor leaving guilt tension and worry behind [Music] the flourish of seagulls above you floating and gliding on past looking up you follow with your eyes as they slowly fade away mix in with the very blue sky above as if dissolving into the horizon [Music] the cells around you orchestrate calmness peace and tranquility the more you observe the more you may feel the warmth somewhere in your body possibly a real jewel chest area of relief and contentedness [Music] let your worries just dissolve now as you fully absorb yourself and become one with this atmosphere of bliss nothing matters and nobody needs your attention right now let yourself be free and present appreciating every positive aspect of peace that you are surrounded by [Music] as you walk toward the gentle rhythm of the spinning waves that stroke the sand your feet feel warm massaged with every step that you take [Music] noticing your feet and toes relax a little your breathing becomes easier and worried and tension is left behind [Music] [Music] you will now the person you know to be one that is calm filled with peace and content leaving all outside distractions you begin to uncover your true self your mind has been playing up to the situation's you have been around as if slipping in thoughts that are misplaced by sleight of hand now knowing that in some part that those feelings are but an illusion by changing your mindset and focusing on more positive ideas and images those thoughts and sensations just dispersed [Music] very much like doing something you know will take a lot of time energy and hard work you have to change the way your mind focuses [Music] in front you see a beautiful scene of sand sea and wolf filling your mind with such an image as a positive effect which transcends to your body in relaxation as you walk closer to the water's edge you feel the very relaxing fine sand under and around your feet with every step your mind drifts off more creating more clear thinking to focus on this presence travel moment [Music] as your feet pressed down on the sand weather calm waves cycle back and forth the warm water glides over your ankles instantly taking away any leftover attention in all areas of your body [Music] every muscle is now fully relaxed softer and resting gently as you are hypnotically massaged by every soft spill of warm white water [Music] looking outwards you notice the blue ocean glistening as a million ripples shimmer in the daytime Sun [Music] on the sand are a few pebbles within reach they are round and smooth laying under the water you pick up three of them and look help to see again you wonder how well these pebbles were skinned on the calm surface of the warm water [Music] as you slowly pull your arm back with the first pebble you place a thought that you would like to go with the stone [Music] when you already the pebble and thought go as one across the air [Music] smoothly skimming the top of the water eventually making a satisfying plunk as they drift to the ocean floor [Music] as the pebble and food disappear from sight you feel slightly more clear-minded relaxed and a piece [Music] with your mind now being more serene you begin to notice more around you where you have been standing soaking up the gentle white water wash you can see small golden fish have been swimming nearby in this clear blue sea crabs tickling the water with their pincers and a reflection of the water when your legs are another indication of how relaxed you are feeling right now [Music] when you think more clearly and more positively things around you can be seen more obviously it only takes a shift in focus and perception to realize this now these may only be small things to notice but they help to create a fuller picture outside in life this can also be practiced where there may be stressful or anxious situations a shift in focus can change how you feel and more importantly help you follow through of a more positive outcome the more this is practiced consciously the easier it will become and the stronger more calm you will be in these situations [Music] walking along the shore at the water's edge brings a sense of freedom as you look around at the beauty that surrounds you from the lull of each wave you step through the untouched blue sky to the endless horizon you see beyond you relax more becoming happier inside and more carefree [Music] having this time to let things settle down is an important step towards bringing peace to yourself wandering along the shore a sea plane slides along the horizon and training behind his aband which reads relax and let go [Music] the plane is a reminder of the busy thoughts that once occupied your mind as it slowly flies past at a distance being so far away you are safe remaining calm and balanced it fits quite nicely into this blissful setting with its hum whispering in the background gentle waves and brushing palm trees also have a calming effect you can incorporate this into the outside world by creating a balance that works for you where you remain fully in control [Music] it all begins with noticing your body as soon as you sense any tension or different thought pattern that brings about these feelings you can adjust how you react to them you are always in control [Music] filling yourself with positive feelings and even thinking about this tranquil place that you are in right now can help maintain and ease those worries away as time goes by this process will become quicker and easier also the more you notice these slight differences quicker you'll be able to adjust and regain a more comfortable state of mind [Music] sometimes it's not a question of how relaxed you are feeling but of how aware of your mind and body you are having this urge of knowing what is going on being present can help in situations with focus and balance is needed [Music] as you continue along the coast your feet are wash with the warm salty sea fill pleasantly relaxed with each unwed step your shoulders and top of your arms relax down as you stare out to sea noticing more along the way [Music] as the beach curves around much like a Cove you faintly see wisps of smoke from a small campfire burning in the distance with the Sun now setting with its orange glow you can hurriedly walk around the shore making your way over to the somewhat mysterious settlement [Music] the Sun sets over the ocean bringing with it the sky of reds purples and orange [Music] still very warm the colors bring a visual representation without feeling to your eyes [Music] the once shimmering service of the ocean was over white and blue as the Sun slowly sets downwards it has become a blanket of warm red and orange sparkles [Music] the sand that was once bright yellow is now of an orange rather looking like it is encrusted with diamonds as it shimmers below the setting sky the shadows of everything all now long bold as though leaning away from that orange horizon like the hands of a clock counting down the Sun [Music] the campfire is now in sight and the warm scent of wood burning can now be appreciated a weld the fire is furred water and a soft mattress bed underneath a large umbrella [Music] as you walk closer a sign that has been placed in the sand bears your name and below is a letter for you to read you reach down picking up the letter and see that this comfortable camp has been made up for you [Music] there is no name on the letter but all it says is that this is a thank you for taking the time to notice this beautiful place and being aware of your feelings [Music] feeling quite accomplished in your findings you humbly place the letter back and walk over to the food and water the Lok Fire gently bellows away generating enough heat to keep you born as you tuck into the food that has been left for you [Music] certain warm fine sound as you finish your meal you see the Sun has now set and the stars have been revealed in the night sky you could not imagine a more blissful place being more calm than what it has been but the night time brings a special quietness to everything the sky is now of a dark blue and black the ocean a cream and purple [Music] the breeze is no longer as the clear light sky extends its reach over the horizon the Stars now shine brightly and the moon is clear to see giving a subtle light to every edge [Music] as you look up you observe the craters on the moon surface on a bed of gentle ripples the sound from the shore your eye is now feeling heavy from relief and contentedness you take a few sandy steps to the thick soft mattress that lay upon the beach pulling back the blanket you clamber in and sink down deep into its hugging material your head slowly descends into the pillow as you feel all your energy let go [Music] looking into the very warm lock fire the flames magnetized your stare the boys you'd look through the flames the heavier your eyes become feeling reassured safe and at peace [Music] the blanket mattress and pillow softly beckon your muscles to relax with each deep and gentle breath that you take [Music] as you lay there quiet calm and relaxed your boys close one more time [Music] the sounds of the ocean the fire and your breathing hypnotically deep in your world and lead for sleep [Music] now knowing more than what you did before you came here brings relief that you can come back at any time taking with you all and everything you have seen heard and felt you now know you can use this experience to benefit you in the outside world [Music] with every deep breath and relaxed muscle comes a certainty but you are stronger than what you think you are you can harness the calm inside yourself at any time [Music] you will go through situations with a level head balance and remain fully in control at all times [Music] rest now relax more into this comfortable place let this calmness rest your mind and body to help you awake were first in a positive mood that will last longer will each and every day from now on [Music] let your mind know you are in control and that you are able to observe changes in how you feel whilst allowing for small adjustments when you notice small and subtle signs and symptoms [Music] from the time you awake you will have the ability to distance yourself from the way that you have been feeling recently close your eyes deeper now let your body just relax and let go [Music] nothing has changed in the time that you have laid here except your focus and perception of what goes on inside you are safe calm and relaxed [Music] slowly and surely drifting off into dreams as you relax and let go you enter sleep willingly and invite it with more acceptance [Music] drifting down deeper everything fading away as she no absorbed peaceful sleep with hugs and chose to let go [Music] [Music]

for going deeper and deeper into comfort as you relax further you see a light at the bottom of the stairs 3 almost to the bottom of the staircase almost to the light shining up at you two you continue deep deep into relaxation and one all the way into your deepest state of relaxation where you arrive at the bottom of the staircase and now that you have reached the bottom of the beautiful staircase you are completely relaxed and comfortable take a moment to look at your surroundings in this dream state here you can see more clearly now that the light you see is shining out from behind a partially closed door at the bottom of the staircase this light is seeping out from the edges of the door expanding its light outward yet being partially blocked by the door you have a sense that behind this door lies all that you are capable of and all of your inner potential this light is shining out only a little bit allowing only some of your potential to be seen the door is essentially blocking the light of your potential to be fully seen you know that before this door can be opened all the way there are things that you must let go of there are blocks that must be removed recognizing that there are blocks that need to be let go of is the first step take a moment and first let go of any negativity you may be holding on to this negativity doesn't have to be named specifically just let it go let the energy of negativity go let the weight of limiting beliefs go see these beliefs floating away like a feather being blown by the wind only to be replaced with new positive beliefs these limitations we put on ourselves can be holding us back from moving forwards towards our ideal life and towards contentment let it all go let go of any expectations you have of yourself and let go of any expectations you believe others have for you let go of the need to please anyone but you and [Music] let go of the tendency to care what others think let go of attachments let it all go let go of competition with past versions of yourself and with others let go of the idea of being perfect and the need to always be right let go of the times when you find yourself thinking you should be saying or doing something in your life let it all go let go of excuses let go of judgmental thoughts let go of jealousy and thoughts of not enough let go of insecurities let it all go let go of the past in order to move forward let go of worries of the future let go of fear let go of grudges and forgive allow the past to be the past and not create your future path and let go of anything else that is no longer serving you be here now be present be mindful be grateful be full of joy and be loved once all of these ideas thoughts and blocks have been released begin to replace them with positive thoughts and energy you can now replace these thoughts with the simple and powerful idea that you are enough you are enough a deep inner confidence and sense of peace is had when you believe deep down that you are enough hear the words feel them in your heart let them sink into your subconscious beliefs you are enough you are enough you are enough being enough means being comfortable with your body just as it is today being enough is being comfortable with what you have achieved as well as what you have not yet accomplished being enough means self-acceptance and it is something we can all say to ourselves more often let this feeling of being enough settle into your belief system for a moment longer let it sink into your body like muscle memory what you put out into this world will come back to you put out positivity send out love and light radiate this positive energy outward to the world and it will come back to you give what you wish to receive and now that you have let go of all the negativity and replaced it with positive love and light now you know it is time to open the door at the bottom of the stairway all the way you know it is time to let the light your light shine out all the way so you can live your fullest potential with a deep inner confidence and knowing that you are enough you can see yourself reach forward to open the door as you place your hand on the doorknob and pull all of your inner strength determination then potential flows out filling up your mind and the space around you feel the strength and positivity flow out from your mind and fill up your entire body and into your heart you are now completely full with potential and possibilities let yourself hear these words and feel their truth in your body you are confident and capable you are creative and intelligent you are enough and more because you have let go of all of the negative in your life you have the space to fill up with your full potential you know you are able to achieve great things now that your inner strength and potential have been released from behind this door and now you walk into this light feel the energy and strength of your full potential surrounding you filling you up this energy builds your confidence and motivation on the other side of the door you find a bench to sit down on here you can sit and contemplate your full potential and you take this new energy confidence and motivation and allow your mind to wander and be imaginative you allow yourself to be open to possibilities you are open to change and the opportunities that come with these changes you choose to soften into these possibilities lovingly although you have a strong idea of what you want and what is important to you you are willing to give a little and to be flexible you understand it takes time for changes to happen and take root you are patient and grateful for where you are on this journey you know you are exactly where you are supposed to be right now in life we often need to let go of what no longer serves us in order to make room for change in order to be open to the process of change wow this isn't always easy you are committed to doing what is right for your best interest and what is in alignment with your values rather than what's easy with change comes various emotions and you welcome them and you seek to feel them understand them and embrace these emotions without becoming attached to any outcomes you don't give up at times of unexpected challenge you persevere all of your thoughts are positive in your mind repeat after me I am open to change I am worthy of love and success I am confident I am diligent and moving towards my desired success I believe in myself and my abilities I am courageous and brave I am authentically me I am creating my own future I follow my dreams with passion and certainty I let go of the past and focus on the now I am enough I am grateful for today feeling confident

0 Find a comfortable position sitting or lying down. Notice how you are feeling right now...physically and mentally.  Take a deep breath in through your nose, and release the breath through your mouth.  Take another breath, and allow your breathing to relax you as you exhale fully.  Breathe in gently... and as you breathe out, let the air carry the tension out of your body.  Continue to breathe slowly and gently as you begin to focus on relaxing your body.  Notice where your body is tense. Focus your attention on one of these areas. As you breathe, picture that part of your body becoming slightly more relaxed than it was before. With each breath, that part of your body becomes a little more relaxed.  Imagine what the relaxation feels like... tingly... soft... gentle... calm... loose... free... and let that feeling of relaxation grow.  Scan your body for any areas of tension, and for each area, let the relaxation soften the muscles as they give up their hold. Let the feeling of relaxation grow...spreading calm throughout your body.  Breathe in relaxation... and breathe out tension...breathe in calm...and let all the tension go as you exhale...  Continue to breathe slowly, and gently, deepening your state of relaxation more and more with each breath. Deeper and deeper. More and more relaxed. Calm. At peace.  Now begin to create a picture in your mind. Imagine a place where you feel completely at ease. This might be a favorite place you have been, or somewhere you have seen, or it might be completely imaginary. It's up to you. Picture this place where you feel happy and calm.  Create the details about this place in your mind. Visualize the sights... sounds... and smells... of your place. Imagine how you feel physically. You are comfortable, enjoying the pleasant temperature... enjoying being still and relaxing or doing whatever enjoyable activities you participate in here...  Enjoy the way you feel in this safe place.  You feel calm and safe here. At peace with yourself.  Remain in your peaceful place while you meditate calmly and build your self-esteem.  Imagine that all of the following affirmations are true for you, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation you experience. Repeat each affirmation in your mind, or out loud, with conviction. Use your imagination to fully believe each self-esteem relaxation affirmation.    The self-esteem relaxation affirmations begin now.  I am at peace with myself.  I appreciate who I am.  I value myself as a person.  All people have value, and I am a valuable human being.  I deserve to relax  I deserve to be happy.  I embrace my happy feelings, and enjoy being content.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  When my mood is low, I accept my emotions and recognize that the low mood will pass, and I will be happy again. I look forward to the good times.  My future is bright and positive.  I look forward to the future, and I enjoy the present.  I look fondly upon many memories from my past.  I forgive myself for my mistakes. All people make mistakes. I used to feel regret about some of my mistakes because I am a good person and want to do the best that I can, and now, I am still a good person and I release the feelings of regret because I have learned and moved on. I forgive myself for errors I have made, because I have felt bad about them long enough. I have suffered enough, and now it is time to be free. By freeing myself from past mistakes, I can move on and do good things. I forgive myself.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  I feel good about who I am today.  I accept the person that I am. I accept my flaws, and accept my strengths.  I view my shortcomings as strengths not yet developed, rather than as weaknesses.  I eagerly develop new strengths.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  I approach challenges with strength.  I do the best that I can at the time. I give 100% effort when I am able and when I choose to put full effort toward the things that are important. I accept my imperfections and the imperfections in what I do. My efforts are good enough, and they're okay.  I do not have to be perfect to be okay as a person.  I am a human being with flaws. I enjoy being who I am, and love myself as I am.  I nurture the child within me.  I feel secure in who I am, and do not need to compare myself to others.  All of the strengths I have ever had are present in me today. I still have the same positive character, even if not all of my strengths are shown right now. I have all of those strengths of character, and will use those strengths again.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  I accept myself.  I care for myself.  I take time for myself, and enjoy it. I deserve time for myself, and I feel good about taking this time regularly.  I handle difficulties with grace.  I allow myself to experience and express emotions, both negative and positive.  I accept myself.  I am perfectly alright just the way I am.  I accept myself.  I am a valuable human being.  I accept myself.  I feel confident.  I accept myself.  I feel secure.  I accept myself.  I accept myself.   Think again about your peaceful place. Picture yourself enjoying this environment. Acknowledge the feelings you are experiencing after repeating the self-esteem relaxation affirmations. Accept any positive or negative feelings you are having. Allow yourself to feel calm and at peace. Now it is time to leave your special place. Know that you can return here in your imagination any time to relax, feel calm and relaxed, and feel comfortable and safe. Take with you the feelings of acceptance of yourself, and belief in the self-esteem relaxation affirmations. Continue to feel positive and accepting of yourself. Hold onto this secure feeling of self-esteem as you return to your day.  In a moment I will count to 3. If you choose to sleep, you can drift into a relaxing and pleasant sleep on the count of 3. If you wish to become fully awake, you can increase your alertness and become energized and fully alert on the count of 3.  One... take a deep, cleansing breath in... and exhale slowly.  Two... take another deep breath... and exhale...  Three... you are feeling calm, confident, and refreshed.

0 hello and welcome thank you for taking the time to listen to this meditation to help you find inner peace it will help you to calm the feelings of being overwhelmed that may cause you to get anxious or stuck in life we are a culture of information overload and live in a busy over scheduled world where we often think we need to do it all and do it perfectly this mindset of being attached to the perfect outcomes can be at the root of overwhelm or anxiety and can cause you to get stuck in your thoughts or actions today we will begin the process of self inquiry to get curious about what we are really feeling be okay with life as it is and then nurture and open our hearts with kindness this process will help you to find peace from within let's begin make yourself comfortable with your arms and legs uncrossed make sure to turn off all possible distractions and set this time aside for you in a moment I will guide you through a body scan to begin the process of relaxation so you can release tension and negativity by letting go completely you can turn your attention inward and now allow your eyes to close gently and bring your focus to your breath [Music] without changing your breath simply notice how it flows in through your nose feel the cool air as it passes into your nostrils and fills you up encourage each natural out-breath to release any tension that you may be feeling continue to observe your breath and allow it to deepen naturally and slow down today you will practice connecting to what is true for you in your heart you will cultivate loving energy for yourself to nurture what is true for you and to find peace give yourself permission to be fully supported by the earth to connect to the collective energy of the universe and to be open to possibilities of what comes with the state of comfort and relaxation and now slowly begin to scan your body as I say each part of your body encouraged a release a complete relaxation to find ease in your body allow the surface below you to support you fully [Music] begin this body scan at your feet and simply relax move your attention up from your feet and begin to release your lower legs and knees feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and connected to the energy around you as you allow it to let go and now find a sense of ease and your thighs and hips as you let go completely moving up take a deep breath to help release any tightness in your lower back continue this process of increasing your comfort and connection to the collective energy of the universe around you and welcome a feeling of softening into your abdomen let your chest and arms rest heavy on the surface below you feel as your neck and throat release any physical and emotional tension that you may be holding on to [Music] allow your jaw to unclench and feel as the small muscles of your cheeks I then forehead soften and smooth and as the small muscles in your face and jaw let go the rest of your body follows and softens as well now your whole body is heavy on the earth [Music] and allowing your breath to return to its natural rhythm and flow you find that you are fully relaxed you know you are safe and supported and you are open to guiding yourself into a calm state of mind now that you are fully relaxed you can begin this inquiry process by checking in with what is true for you what you are actually feeling without judgment and without trying to change anything [Music] make space for the truth to surface and whatever form it comes simply allow it to surface [Music] consider the situation or feeling that has you overwhelmed or stuck recognize what you are feeling and accepted in the present moment know that the state of overwhelm is simply an obstacle on your path and it is part of your journey [Music] because this may be a negative or challenging emotion let down your guard and your armor to this emotion make space for awareness and acceptance without judgement we often have the unconscious impulse to push away suppress or ignore difficult emotions which simply brings about more suffering some might busy themselves to prove their worth or neglect what is really going on some may have a fear of failure and the overwhelm may paralyze them some may feel anxious or restless based on all that there is to do whatever you are feeling is okay these are simply patterns that have developed they are not you recognize the self-talk going on in your mind recognize the potential that you may have unmet or unrecognized expectations from yourself or others that may be playing a role in the judgments of yourself [Music] or possibly you're experiencing negative self-talk [Music] begin to move out of the thinking patterns and bring your attention to your felt experience no need to attach words or labels to your feelings simply explore what those feelings are [Music] pause and allow these feelings sometimes we may be judgmental when a negative feeling surfaces acknowledged the feeling and allow it to be what it is without judgment [Music] or sometimes we may push the feeling down and focus on something else [Music] in this situation being present is the way stay in the moment stay with the feeling and be okay with it continue to make space in your heart for these feelings to come up and simply be [Music] we may want to resist the discomfort of a negative feeling and remove ourselves from the present moment do your best to stay present and mindful in a time when difficult emotions come up practicing a moment of pause after recognizing a feeling or behavior gives you the opportunity to make another choice a different choice than you are used to making creating space during this moment of pause allows you to stop the negative habit or behavior before it continues it allows you to respond skillfully rather than reacting by simply allowing the difficult emotion to be what it is you are able to bring your awareness to the present moment experience and you may notice almost immediately a sense of softening and ease around the emotion simply by allowing it to be with honesty and acceptance comes the ability to move forward and to grow once you have recognized the emotion and allowed it to be what it is get curious about what you are feeling and what is behind the feeling explore your own truth breathe deeply to allow space for your truth to surface [Music] now is the time for some deep self inquiry start to ask yourself some questions about what you are experiencing what is underneath the feelings you are experiencing is there a physical component to how you are feeling the answers may not come immediately and that is okay continue to allow the emotions to surface in these next few moments of quiet make space for the truth and acceptance of what is the answers will come in time [Music] [Music] begin to let go of judgments let go of self-limiting beliefs let go of expectations let go of fear let go of any negativity you may be holding on to this negativity doesn't have to be named specifically just let it go let the energy of negativity go let go of any past negativities and replace them with positive thoughts and gratitude take a moment to release all that is holding you back all that you have pushed down any anger and resentment any fears and any negativity [Music] as you bring the feelings and emotions to the surface do so with a sense of unconditional love for yourself see what is really going on for you and proceed with care and compassion continue to come back to the felt experience and move out of the thinking patterns and then take some time to nurture yourself place your hand on your heart if you like and offer love and kindness to yourself open your heart and let it in offer positive energy to the area of your heart [Music] ask yourself what it is you need in this moment to care for yourself to nurture and support you ask this of yourself often and listen really listen to what it is that you need to calm the sense of overwhelm to get unstuck to find peace within and now bring your attention back to your physical body and deepen your breath once more you are now beginning your journey back to the present moment and as you do you will continue to nurture yourself with care and compassion you will find inner peace begin to reactivate each part of your body from its relaxed State feel the rush of energy back into your body like a warm wave coming over you awakening your body slowly and when you are ready open your eyes you are fully back in this present moment feeling awake and energized
0 Welcome to this simple meditation to relieve stress.  Get into a nice position where you can be upright, elongating the spine.  It is best to be seated in the traditional meditation position with legs crossed, but if you need to have your back supported, you may sit in a chair.  Gaze around with your eyes, taking note of your surroundings.  See the colors clearly.  Notice things that are completely still around you, like the ground, furniture, and structures.  Can you become aware of anything around you that has movement?  Look around without putting labels on the things you see, just observe their colors, textures and patterns.  Notice how far away things are from you, or how close they are.  See how the light lays upon things, illuminating them.  Allow your mind to naturally find a spot in front of you to fixate on.  Begin to slowly blink your eyes, and do not look away.  Feel the relaxation within the darkness each time you blink.  Repeat think until your eyes want to naturally close.  When you close your eyes, notice a gentle wave of relaxation sweep over your entire body.  Bring your awareness to your breath, what is it like?  Did you take a nice inhale as soon as you focused on your breathing?  Pay close attention to how your lungs expand and contract with your breath.  It is a very natural and gentle sensation.  Noticing how your belly also expands and contracts easily as you breathe.  Allow the breath to relax you.  In and out…..  Expand and contract….  Refresh and relax…..  Inhale and exhale…..

your breath you may not have noticed before [Music] maybe you notice the cool air as it passes through your nostrils on your inhale or the warm quality of the air as it is being released know that each exhale is a time to let go even further into relaxation notice your breathing as it comes and goes [Music] noticing your breath you can relax further if you wish you may notice with the attention on your breath it has naturally slowed down it has relaxed you [Music] like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow down with every breath you may sense more space between your breaths as well

away any remaining tension or emotional strain from your body and your mind [Music] to fully engage with life it is important to acknowledge and accept your emotions letting go of labels of right or wrong and good or bad emotions are simply energy and when you allow yourself to experience these emotions as they arise the energy will move through you and the emotions do not need to rule you [Music] become aware of an emotion that is present within you now sense the feeling of this emotion with acceptance when you accept an emotion as it is in the present you can allow the energy to move through you [Music] acknowledge this emotion lean into this feeling and do your best to accept this emotion stay with the feeling of the emotion and let go of the story about the emotion you may begin to notice a sense of softening and ease around this emotion when you connect with and sit with this energy it doesn't have to rule you as it moves through you this energy allows you to become more aware of the full experience of life as you continue this relaxed inward awareness become aware of any thoughts arising witness them without following them see them surface flow by and disappear you may even think of thoughts as slippery objects that you couldn't hold on to even if you wanted to when you grasp or try to hold on to the thoughts they slip right out of your grip if it feels right to you as you notice the thinking as you breathe in say in your mind i am aware of thoughts arising as you breathe out say in your mind i am aware of thoughts passing or more simply thoughts arising thoughts passing allow this process to relax your mind and body [Music] even deeper you may even notice your thoughts coming with more space between them as you practice allowing them to rise and fall let go of judgments of thoughts knowing they are not good or bad be the witness of the thoughts in the present allow the thoughts to pass by like clouds in the sky they have their chance to be seen and honored and then they flowed away just as quickly allow ease to settle in to your mind and body allow yourself to go further still into relaxation as you shift your focus to the area of your heart begin to cultivate a positive quality of gratitude to change your state from within [Music] enjoy the expansive open space at your heart as you recall something or someone that naturally brings the feeling of gratitude into your heart hold on to this feeling of gratitude in your heart let gratitude arise and fill your body and mind [Music] allow yourself to be grateful and appreciate that life

0 thank you for taking the time to listen to this guided meditation to help reduce stress and anxiety this practice of relaxation is most beneficial when done regularly where the benefits are compounding and over time it will become easier for you while this practice of meditation will take many different forms and look different from person to person don't expect perfection be patient with your practice and the resulting effects if you find value from this and believe you know someone else that can benefit from listening please share with your friends and family the idea of being in the present moment is a powerful one when it comes to anxiety and stress we are often scheduled to the max and we become physically and emotionally stressed out we often find our mind cluttered and overthinking we worry about how the past could have gone differently where we wonder if the future will go as exactly as we plan it this meditation will help to calm down your overthinking mind it will help you to be present so that you can simplify and clear the clutter of your mind it has been said by many great thought leaders in this world but the way we do anything is the way we do everything so if we want to declutter our mind we must also declutter our physical world this mindfulness meditation can be used to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past and anxieties about the future more you practice this the easier it will become for you and you will see the benefits trickle over into many other areas of your life and now turn off all distractions and commit this time for yourself let go of your to-do lists and your responsibilities take this time for you for self-care of the gift to enjoy you must first help yourself and love yourself before you can help or love anyone else and when you are ready close your eyes and bring your full awareness to your breath begin to count your breath in then as you breathe out encourage the exhale to be one count longer than the inhale allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress and tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow and your body will calm down do this for a few breaths cycles then allow the breath to return to its natural rhythm know that your breath is an anchor to the present moment you know that you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment so you know you are always in the present moment when you are attentive to your breath as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer notice your thoughts and acknowledge them by saying in your mind thinking then come back to the breath and use this breath as an anchor to keep coming back to whenever your mind wanders this breath anchor is a grounding and stress relieving practice to continue outside of the session whenever you may experience a stressful situation at any point in life you can always just come back to your breath as if you are starting over this anchor will allow you to relax and times of stress as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and to slow down allow your body to soften and your breath to be gone know that your body responds to your thoughts so think about relaxing and ask your body for a release of tension your mind is so powerful in creating change in all aspects of your life and now as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up as you breathe out that white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of anxiety take a long slow deep breath in through your nose and now move the breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to just surrender as you exhale breathing out anything that no longer serves you each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even more deeply and now invite your body to relax each muscle completely begin with the muscles around the eyes and the jaw by relaxing these muscles specifically the rest of the body knows exactly what to do and will relax in response continue to unclench the jaw completely and soften the muscles around the eyes to begin to feel that familiar heaviness throughout the entire body all you have to do is think about relaxing and releasing the tension in your body and your body will respond because it listens to what your mind tells it and now feel the entire body let go feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside stay with your breath when you find your mind wandering stay with the physical sensations of your body so that your mind can continue to clear the clutter of the overthinking tendency know that your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you you are in complete control but for now your mind and body know it is time to relax and let go time to slow down right now all sounds around you are unimportant and they just add to your relaxation all responsibilities and items on your to-do list are unimportant right now all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow your body to relax and your subconscious mind will do the job of clearing the clutter notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper you now allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go letting your body mind and spirit become one and now begin to use your imagination and take a moment to see yourself in front of a beautifully decorated glass elevator door this class door is etched and frosted with the most amazing design on it see this design in your mind reach out and feel the texture with your fingertips feel the cool temperature of the glass this elevator will take you down to the deepest part of your subconscious mind so that you can declutter your thoughts release tension and negativity you see the door slowly opening and you step into the spacious elevator you know you are completely safe and you can see through the glass walls of the elevator you push the B button so that you can go down to the basement of your mind this elevator will lead you deep into relaxation each level will take you deeper down and in a moment as I begin to count the elevator will take you down slowly into a more deep relaxation you will find that a deeper down you go the more comfortable and the more relaxed you'll become 10 as the elevator begins at slow descent you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do eight you know you are right where you need to be on your journey and you allow the outside world to just to turn off seven each level down takes you even deeper into a relaxed state six you're committed to taking your life and dreams to the next level five letting go completely for going deeper and deeper into comfort the REE almost to the basement of your subconscious mind - deep deep relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and peace and now we have reached the bottom the elevator doors slowly open and you walk out into the basement of your subconscious mind you take a look around and see that you have stepped out into what looks like a library that stores all of your memories as well as the possibilities for your future there are rows and rows of shelves throughout the entire room each shelf filled with many many books you see books of all different sizes and colors some of the books are disorganized and there are areas of clutter around the floor in front of some of the shelves you feel an intense desire to organize the books so that they are easily accessed when needed and to clean up the clutter around the room knowing that by doing this you will organize and declutter your mind and your life you realize that just by thinking about organizing and cleaning magically this room changes the room becomes well-organized and the clutter is cleared this change has simplified your life and with this change you feel a positive change within yourself you know that deep inside you a switch has been reset so that everything works in your favor you are now organized and decluttered in all areas of your life as well as your thinking mind you are able to generate support and inspiration for yourself far more easily than before you enrich yourself mentally emotionally and spiritually to do all that it takes to actualize your goals thrive and live in alignment with your values and intentions you begin to take even better care of yourself you redefine yourself as a happier energetic and more lighthearted person you feel the physical weight of anxiety has been lifted to allow you to be a lighter and calmer you allow new and more empowered thoughts and inspired feelings of success healing wellness and happiness to profoundly build within you you respect yourself showing yourself loving kindness and compassion and now you let go of any negative thoughts that no longer serve you you let go of any pasts negativities and you replace them with positive behaviors positive thoughts and feelings of gratitude you are aware of your thoughts and you have the ability to change from a negative thought to a positive one just by being aware you believe that you could be strong and confident in your life you see your past limiting beliefs and behaviors disappear self-doubt fear and anxiety are things of the past and you replace them with optimism confidence and an easily calm disposition you trust your instincts and your abilities you are easily able to accept things as they are knowing that you are exactly where you are supposed to be on your journey and now bringing your attention to the room around you take one last look around at the organized and decluttered space of your subconscious mind know that this new organized space will translate to stress free anxiety free living in all aspects of your life now as you begin to walk back towards the elevator the doors slowly open and invite you in as you step into the elevator you have a strong sense that you can continue to reduce stress and anxiety in your life by continuing the process of simplifying and clearing the clutter oh you are capable of achieving your dreams and you have the potential to accomplish great things now bring your attention back to your physical body and your breath you will easily and effortlessly be able to use the breath as an anchor when you come out of the state of relaxation and now as an observer see yourself smiling with a positive calm and competent mind feeling proud and grateful when you awake you will still feel all of the positive feelings you experienced in this meditation and you have patience and persistence for the practice of simplifying and decluttering your mind and physical world in just a moment I will count as the elevator slowly brings you back up and when you get to the top you will begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment feeling relaxed yet energized and confident one you are slowly beginning to come out of the state of comfort to bring your awareness to the present moment to the sounds around you to your physical body 3 you are feeling totally relaxed and calm for your mind is clear calm and confident 5 your

0 you gonna sit with me girl am i live all right welcome welcome everyone thanks for joining me uh if you're new here i'm sarah raymond with the mindful movement i'm really honored to have you here and if you are joining me again welcome back uh if you if you have been here you might notice that this is not my typical space i am outside it is cold in maryland so i have my my lovely scarf that my daughter knitted for me sorry crocheted excuse me she will get mad that i said that and uh we got a fire and here i am i'm glad to be here and i just want to take a minute to talk a little bit about control so we don't really have control right like i don't have control over the wind tonight i don't have control over the smoke that might blow into my face or the dog's making noise or all of the things so we do have choice so i decided i wanted to go live tonight i made the choice that i was okay with not having control over the lighting and the space and the temperature and all the things and i made the choice to respond in a way that i could still feel safe and i could be okay with my choice and that's the lesson or the the teaching i'd love to embody or impart in today's practice so if you do hear the wind blowing then i invite you to sit with it recognize how your body instinctively responds you might even acknowledge that response and see if you can still work to calm your body calm your responses as we go through the practice so that's my my intention my invitation for you and if you have any other intention for today's practice then please honor that and that being said today's practice will be very gentle not a lot of movement per se but self massage and various exercises to help you regulate your nervous system or calm the nervous system and we're not going to get into a lot of the science or the what's happening just to feel into the experience but i did leave a link in the description box below the video to two different books that are great resources so if you do want to learn a little bit more check those out all right so let's jump right in so make yourself comfortable i'm sitting down obviously you're welcome to sit in a chair if that's more comfortable for you i would suggest being upright for at least the first portion of it as we get into the meditation then you can lie down and i should mention that les is here with us behind the camera and he will be in the chat so if you have any questions comments please feel free to leave them i'm just getting uh getting a signal we all good less we're all good someone's saying please rotate if possible rotate and here is the we don't have control over everything i think we just have to go with it and we're going to do the best we can tonight am i vertical i think they can rotate it from their device mine looks normal okay less is saying we just gotta go with the flow you can rotate it from their device he is saying you can rotate from your device i hope that helps rotate on your device okay thank you uh we're gonna we're gonna go with the flow tonight and i apologize if there's any glitches or tech technical issues but i hope that you enjoy the practice okay so let's start with a belly breath as a way to just check in so i like to have hands on my belly so i can get a feel for the movement there nothing forced nothing too strenuous just checking in so if you feel like you want to close your eyes you are welcome to do so and then begin to breathe in through your nose sending your breath down into your belly and as you breathe out you might like to breathe out through your mouth like a sigh so you're making a sound if that doesn't feel comfortable any other breath pattern is fine so taking a moment to check in and what i mean by that is notice the state of your body the state of your mind and you might even notice the state of your nervous system no judgment no need to change at this point just noticing you might think of taking like a snapshot in your memory of how you're feeling in this moment and then once you have that baseline let's blink our eyes open again if they were closed and then we're going to go into a little bit of self massage and everything that i offer is just that it's an offering take it if you like it but listen to your body and if it's saying no this isn't so so right for me right now just explore see what your body needs today all right so we're going to start with a a jaw massage so you can find the indentation at the jaw so it's about in line with the earlobe and pardon my dogs you're gonna press your fingers into your jaw fairly firmly going inward listen to your body and you decide how much pressure is right for you and then you can explore maybe circles feel great maybe just holding the pressure feels good perhaps you want to go up and down side to side you can open and close your jaw you might take a nice deep breath in and let it out like a sigh relaxing the lower portion of your jaw all right so if that feels great and you want to keep going keep going otherwise i'll move on to just um to the side of your nose so you think of the the lines that are the crease of our between our nose and our mouth you're gonna go about the top of that crease and you'll press in towards your nose a bit and then once you have that pressure gently pull out so it's almost like you're opening your sinuses and then just like we did with the jaw maybe circles feel great or maybe up and down i know it looks a little silly but we can all be silly together or maybe just hold the pressure and here's a nice place to gently pull out on the skin out on the muscles and take a deep breath in you might even feel you get more air in and let it go again stay there a little longer if you'd like otherwise we're going to go to the corner inside corner of your eyebrows so press pressing in gently you might just let your head rest in your hands and then same options go here you can move around in a circle it'll be a pretty small circle or just up and down and side to side and then again feel free to stay a little longer and then lastly we're going to go to the ears so i'll give you lots of options and you can choose what feels really good leave what doesn't and we'll start inside of the ear so not in the hole of your ear but in the on the cartilage and you're just going to kind of follow the line follow the different parts of your ears around kind of like what you might use a q-tip for although you're not going to go inside the ear canal and then i don't know if you can see this but you're going to grab the earlobes and just gently you can pull out you can pull forward and then work your way up the side of the ear and this area for me always feels really nourishing really relaxing my dogs are going a little crazy running around okay and then just relax your arms by your sides if you want to close your eyes again you can and let's take one more check in so all we've really done is a little bit of self-massage so just notice how that is serving you and just keep in mind everyone's different your body is different your nervous system is different your personal history is different from mine and anyone else that's watching so your experience in this practice will also be different so just take what you like and leave the rest okay so a little bit more nervous system resetting and then we'll move into our meditation so you'll keep your your eye gaze looking forward and then i'll mirror you you can tip your left shoulder excuse me left ear towards your left shoulder without lifting your your shoulder to meet your ear so keep drawing the shoulder down there we go and then with your head still take your eyes as far to your right as you can so it's almost like you're trying to see your right ear with your head tipped to your left keep your eyes fixed right deep breath in through your nose let it out with a sigh again feel free to come out of this sooner if you feel any need to do so one more deep breath in through your nose out like a thigh take your time bring your head back to center eyes back to looking straight ahead blink a couple times and then we'll repeat in the other direction so your right ear towards your right shoulder and then eyes looking as far to your left as you can breathing in and out three breaths if you can come out of it sooner if you need to ah and then the head comes back up eyes look forward blink a few times and then we'll do a variation of that with a side bend so i'm going to offer the side bend if it's too much don't worry about adding it so we'll go back to left ear towards the left shoulder and then you might allow for a little bit more of a side bend so meaning you're you're taking your spine over to your left and if you still want a little bit more your left hand can gently uh gently gently tug on your head and then we'll take eyes now to the left ear so you're looking towards the arm that's up my glasses always seem to be in the way for this one all right so about three breaths there and as you breathe out through your mouth think of relaxing your jaw may even wiggle it side to side and then take your time coming back through center and then other side so we go right here towards the right shoulder feel free to add a little side bend to your right and then option to take your right hand gently very very gently we're not tugging too hard here and then eyes are going to your towards your right ear so it's kind of on a downward diagonal about three breaths uh and then bring your head and eyes back to center okay so i feel a lot more calm than i did when we started so i hope that you do as well although it's not a requirement obviously if that's not how you feel that's your experience but i would love to guide you now into a meditation so if you prefer to lie down you are welcome to do so make yourself comfortable and if you prefer to sit up that's fine too so i like to think of posture as something that we don't have to really think about so get yourself into a position that doesn't take a lot of effort but allows you to be in a a straight spine position and then if you'd like you are welcome to close your eyes you don't have to we want you to feel safe so if you choose not to close your eyes maybe just soften your gaze downward and then just as we started take a moment to simply notice without judgment without the need to change you might notice the state of your physical body state of your your mind your thoughts you might become aware of sounds in your environment sounds coming through the video from my environment and the practice that we just finished we just went through is about inner resourcing about using your own ability to come into a calm state and so when there is a noise when there is a distraction because there will always be distractions the practice is about coming back to yourself coming home to yourself so with that in mind let's begin to move into a box breathing pattern so we are taking a little intention into our breath so we're breathing in for a count holding for the same count breathing out for the same count and holding once more so you might choose to start with a count of three or four and just see how that feels in your body so in your own time breathing in holding breathing out holding continue on your own for a few breaths if you want to increase the length the count of your breath that's fine if you find you get distracted or lose your count simply start over finish the breath cycle that you are on and just allow your breath to be natural and see what you notice are there sensations showing up in your body you might even ask yourself is there a message here as you notice my dog's barking notice your response can you lovingly start over can you lovingly bring yourself home to your experience so in this hopefully calm and reflective state you can ask yourself what is it that i need and just listen no thinking no trying just allow the answer to surface what is it that i need you might notice how your body your mind your nervous system are all responding to this question when was the last time someone asked you that and how does it feel to be able to ask yourself to connect with your inner resources so take another moment to just notice what's there for you and very gradually begin to let your awareness brought in you might start by noticing the support beneath you noticing the air touching any exposed skin [Music] or perhaps you are able to sense the energy around you and before you open your eyes if they're still closed see if you can sense both your inner experience and your outer environment the same time and as best you can keep that awareness of both your inner and outer experience as you blink your eyes open if they were closed coming back to full awareness you might rub your hands together just create a little warmth i know it's a little cold out here for me and then taking the warmth of your hands place the heel of your hands over your eyes very gentle pressure and then you might lean your head the weight of your head down into your hands and just rest there for a moment and you can let go of what you do not need and then gradually releasing your hands lifting your head and i would just love to thank you so much for joining me today in this not-so-typical recording environment i hope that you got what you needed from this experience and i would love to offer you if you are interested in more practices to build a foundation of meditation to check out our free seven-day course the

0 Begin to relax, finding a comfortable position and starting to let the tension leave your body.  Imagine that you are at the top of a stairway. At the bottom of the stairway is a state of peace, calm, and relaxation.  Take note of how you are feeling right now, at the top of the stairway.  Imagine taking a step down the stairway... a single step closer to relaxation. As you take this step, feel your arms relaxing. Becoming heavy. Limp... loose... relaxed.    Further descend the stairway, going down toward relaxation..... down.... down.... to a state of calm and relaxation. Feel your legs relaxing and becoming limp. Your legs are feeling very heavy.... so heavy... feel your legs sinking down, the heaviness pulling your legs down into relaxation.  Picture yourself going slowly down the stairway, one step at a time. It is a comfortable, safe descent to a place of relaxation. Move down step by step, at your own pace, becoming more and more relaxed with each step you take.  Feel the heaviness in your arms and legs.... your arms are so warm and so heavy.... feel gravity pull on your arms gently, pulling your shoulders down into a relaxed position.  Take another step down.... and another.... more deeply relaxed with each step. Feel your neck and back relaxing. Feeling warm, loose... relaxed.  You might even become a bit sleepy as you get closer and closer to relaxation. That's okay.   Allow your mind to drift and your body to relax, heavy and comfortable. Your head and face relax.  Feel the muscles of your face becoming limp, soft, relaxed. Your eyelids are very heavy. It feels so good to close your eyes... your eyelids are so heavy, you cannot keep them open. So heavy and relaxed.  Moving down the stairway, down, down... almost to the bottom now.... when you reach the bottom you will be pleasantly relaxed.  The closer you get to the bottom, the heavier and more relaxed you feel. Your body is so heavy.... but at the same time feels light, as if floating. It is an unusual feeling, but pleasant. So peaceful. Drifting in calm relaxation.  Take the last few steps down to the bottom of the stairway..... sinking into relaxation. So heavy and relaxed.  Reaching the bottom now.... a state of calm and relaxation. You are now feeling peaceful and relaxed.  Now I'll repeat some affirmations for self-esteem. You don't even have to listen or pay attention, you can simply relax while I talk.  Just let your mind drift, and reflect upon these affirmations for self-esteem in the back of your mind, with your subconscious. You can take in the affirmations for self-esteem if you choose to and if they are a good fit for you, and disregard any that do not apply.  Just relax now and let your mind drift for the remainder of this affirmations for self-esteem script.  At the end of the script, I'll count back from 5 to 1, and you can choose to reawaken or drift off to sleep.... but for now, just relax... letting your mind drift.... there is nothing you need to do.... nothing you need to focus on.... just relaxed and calm.  Just let these words drift in your mind, without needing to focus especially on any of them.  You are a worthwhile person.  You are capable of achieving many things.  You deserve to be happy. You can be happy even through difficult circumstances.  You can handle the problems that come your way.  You are a strong person... while understanding that no one needs to be strong all the time.  You are an okay person.... a good person.  Your worth is not measured by achievements, appearance, or other external things. You are worthwhile as a person, just the way you are.  You are perfectly alright, just the way you are.  Accept yourself.  Be kind to yourself.  Take good care of yourself physically and emotionally.  You are okay the way you are.  (pause)  Continue to allow your mind to drift, as you just relax. Allow these affirmations for self-esteem to be true for you, repeating them silently in your mind if you want to, or simply taking them in.  I am a worthwhile person.  I deserve to be happy. I deserve good things.  I am a human being with flaws. It is okay to have flaws.   I am unique, and I appreciate my uniqueness.  I am perfectly alright, just the way I am.  I feel good about myself.  It is okay to like myself.  I am likable.  I have many good qualities.  I am a decent human being.  I do some things wrong and many things right.  I learn from my mistakes, and forgive myself when I make them.  I take time for myself. I deserve this time, and need this time.  I take care of others and I take care of me.  I accept help, support, and love from others.  I am confident.  I hold myself in high regard.  I like myself.  I accept myself.  I am not perfect, and that is okay.  I accept myself.  (pause)  Continue allowing your mind to drift.... relaxing. Let the affirmations for self-esteem become true for you, filling you with a sense of confidence and self-assurance.  You are capable of making positive changes.... capable of increasing your self-esteem.... and of nurturing your self-esteem.  Simply relax now, noticing what it is like to feel good about yourself.... allowing yourself to feel calm and confident.   (pause)  Keep with you this feeling of self-esteem. Remember the affirmations for self-esteem, taking them in and believing them as truth for you.  You can continue to feel good about yourself and keep this feeling of self-assurance, even after you are finished this affirmations for self-esteem script.  I'll count now from 5 to 1, and you can choose to drift off to sleep or become fully awake. When I reach one, you will be either in a state of deep sleep or you will be fully alert and awake, depending on how you have chosen to conclude this affirmations for self-esteem script.  5  4  3  2  1  
0 Begin by taking a deep breath and hold it for 5 seconds…(pause for 5 seconds)…exhale and relax…(pause for 5 seconds)...take another deep breath, as deep as you can, and hold it, count for 5 seconds…(pause for 5 seconds) and as you exhale just imagine blowing out all of your stress…(pause for 5 seconds)...take a third deep breath and hold it…(pause for 5 seconds)...and as you exhale you blow out any stress you’ve been holding on to, saying to yourself “relax now”  [pause for 3 seconds, speaking now with confidence and at a normal pace of speech]  This is your new solution to stress.  Whenever you become stressed in the future, you simply take 3 fully in and deep breaths, holding it at the top of the inhalation for 5 seconds, and when you exhale, blow out any stresses that you feel.  And on the third breath as you exhale you simply say to yourself, relax now.  [Pause for 5 seconds] [speaking slowly with a soothing and gentle voice]  [Body Scan Induction]  Begin by slowly blinking your eyes, and with each number I say, blink once. (pause for 3 seconds in between each number) 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.  Allow your eyes to gently close, and when you do this you feel a wave of relaxation sweep over you.  [speaking even slower now]  Now I’d like for you to focus on the sensations at the top of your head.  Just notice how the very top of your head feels.  [Pause for 5 seconds]  And now let your focus move down to your eyes.  Just notice how your eyes feel and ask them to relax even more.  The little movement in your eyes is called rapid eve movement and is completely normal.
0 hello this is Sara Raymond with mindful movement thank you for taking the time to listen to this guided meditation to help reduce stress and anxiety this practice of relaxation is most beneficial when done regularly where the benefits are compounding and over time it will become easier for you while this practice of meditation will take many different forms and look different from person to person don't expect perfection be patient with your practice and the resulting effects if you find value from this and believe you know someone else that can benefit from listening please share with your friends and family the idea of being in the present moment is a powerful one when it comes to anxiety and stress we are often scheduled to the max and we become physically and emotionally stressed out we often find our mind cluttered and overthinking we worry about how the past could have gone differently where we wonder if the future will go as exactly as we plan it this meditation will help to calm down your overthinking mind it will help you to be present so that you can simplify and clear the clutter of your mind it has been said by many great thought leaders in this world but the way we do anything is the way we do everything so if we want to declutter our mind we must also declutter our physical world this mindfulness meditation can be used to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past and anxieties about the future more you practice this the easier it will become for you and you will see the benefits trickle over into many other areas of your life and now turn off all distractions and commit this time for yourself let go of your to-do lists and your responsibilities take this time for you for self-care of the gift to enjoy you must first help yourself and love yourself before you can help or love anyone else and when you are ready close your eyes and bring your full awareness to your breath begin to count your breath in then as you breathe out encourage the exhale to be one count longer than the inhale allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress and tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow and your body will calm down do this for a few breaths cycles then allow the breath to return to its natural rhythm know that your breath is an anchor to the present moment you know that you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment so you know you are always in the present moment when you are attentive to your breath as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer notice your thoughts and acknowledge them by saying in your mind thinking then come back to the breath and use this breath as an anchor to keep coming back to whenever your mind wanders this breath anchor is a grounding and stress relieving practice to continue outside of the session whenever you may experience a stressful situation at any point in life you can always just come back to your breath as if you are starting over this anchor will allow you to relax and times of stress as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and to slow down allow your body to soften and your breath to be gone know that your body responds to your thoughts so think about relaxing and ask your body for a release of tension your mind is so powerful in creating change in all aspects of your life and now as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up as you breathe out that white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of anxiety take a long slow deep breath in through your nose and now move the breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to just surrender as you exhale breathing out anything that no longer serves you each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even more deeply and now invite your body to relax each muscle completely begin with the muscles around the eyes and the jaw by relaxing these muscles specifically the rest of the body knows exactly what to do and will relax in response continue to unclench the jaw completely and soften the muscles around the eyes to begin to feel that familiar heaviness throughout the entire body all you have to do is think about relaxing and releasing the tension in your body and your body will respond because it listens to what your mind tells it and now feel the entire body let go feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside stay with your breath when you find your mind wandering stay with the physical sensations of your body so that your mind can continue to clear the clutter of the overthinking tendency know that your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you you are in complete control but for now your mind and body know it is time to relax and let go time to slow down right now all sounds around you are unimportant and they just add to your relaxation all responsibilities and items on your to-do list are unimportant right now all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow your body to relax and your subconscious mind will do the job of clearing the clutter notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper you now allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go letting your body mind and spirit become one and now begin to use your imagination and take a moment to see yourself in front of a beautifully decorated glass elevator door this class door is etched and frosted with the most amazing design on it see this design in your mind reach out and feel the texture with your fingertips feel the cool temperature of the glass this elevator will take you down to the deepest part of your subconscious mind so that you can declutter your thoughts release tension and negativity you see the door slowly opening and you step into the spacious elevator you know you are completely safe and you can see through the glass walls of the elevator you push the B button so that you can go down to the basement of your mind this elevator will lead you deep into relaxation each level will take you deeper down and in a moment as I begin to count the elevator will take you down slowly into a more deep relaxation you will find that a deeper down you go the more comfortable and the more relaxed you'll become 10 as the elevator begins at slow descent you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do eight you know you are right where you need to be on your journey and you allow the outside world to just to turn off seven each level down takes you even deeper into a relaxed state six you're committed to taking your life and dreams to the next level five letting go completely for going deeper and deeper into comfort the REE almost to the basement of your subconscious mind - deep deep relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and peace and now we have reached the bottom the elevator doors slowly open and you walk out into the basement of your subconscious mind you take a look around and see that you have stepped out into what looks like a library that stores all of your memories as well as the possibilities for your future there are rows and rows of shelves throughout the entire room each shelf filled with many many books you see books of all different sizes and colors some of the books are disorganized and there are areas of clutter around the floor in front of some of the shelves you feel an intense desire to organize the books so that they are easily accessed when needed and to clean up the clutter around the room knowing that by doing this you will organize and declutter your mind and your life you realize that just by thinking about organizing and cleaning magically this room changes the room becomes well-organized and the clutter is cleared this change has simplified your life and with this change you feel a positive change within yourself you know that deep inside you a switch has been reset so that everything works in your favor you are now organized and decluttered in all areas of your life as well as your thinking mind you are able to generate support and inspiration for yourself far more easily than before you enrich yourself mentally emotionally and spiritually to do all that it takes to actualize your goals thrive and live in alignment with your values and intentions you begin to take even better care of yourself you redefine yourself as a happier energetic and more lighthearted person you feel the physical weight of anxiety has been lifted to allow you to be a lighter and calmer you allow new and more empowered thoughts and inspired feelings of success healing wellness and happiness to profoundly build within you you respect yourself showing yourself loving kindness and compassion and now you let go of any negative thoughts that no longer serve you you let go of any pasts negativities and you replace them with positive behaviors positive thoughts and feelings of gratitude you are aware of your thoughts and you have the ability to change from a negative thought to a positive one just by being aware you believe that you could be strong and confident in your life you see your past limiting beliefs and behaviors disappear self-doubt fear and anxiety are things of the past and you replace them with optimism confidence and an easily calm disposition you trust your instincts and your abilities you are easily able to accept things as they are knowing that you are exactly where you are supposed to be on your journey and now bringing your attention to the room around you take one last look around at the organized and decluttered space of your subconscious mind know that this new organized space will translate to stress free anxiety free living in all aspects of your life now as you begin to walk back towards the elevator the doors slowly open and invite you in as you step into the elevator you have a strong sense that you can continue to reduce stress and anxiety in your life by continuing the process of simplifying and clearing the clutter oh you are capable of achieving your dreams and you have the potential to accomplish great things now bring your attention back to your physical body and your breath you will easily and effortlessly be able to use the breath as an anchor when you come out of the state of relaxation and now as an observer see yourself smiling with a positive calm and competent mind feeling proud and grateful when you awake you will still feel all of the positive feelings you experienced in this meditation and you have patience and persistence for the practice of simplifying and decluttering your mind and physical world in just a moment I will count as the elevator slowly brings you back up and when you get to the top you will begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment feeling relaxed yet energized and confident one you are slowly

0 This practice provides a different lens through which you can examine the body.  Give yourself space to drop in and deeply investigate these elements in your body.  Try to bring an open mind, and see what you can learn about yourself.  Remember that mindfulness is about seeing clearly, and looking at things from a new perspective can often bring that clarity.  Settle into a relaxed position.  Close the eyes, and bring your awareness to the places in the body where you experience contact, such as the feet on the floor, the hands in the lap, or the body sitting in the chair.  Begin with the element of earth or solid form.  Without thinking too hard about what this means, openly examine where and how you can feel solidity.  This might be the structure of your skeleton, the chair you’re sitting on, any places of tension in the body, or the weight of your muscles as they relax.  Don’t rush through these sensations or try to force them.  When you feel the earth element in the body, stay with it for a few deep breaths.  Continue this seeking, recognizing, and feeling for a few breaths.  After five minutes, switch to the element of air or wind.  An obvious place to start is in the form of the body breathing.  Where can you feel the air of the breath?  You may also look for places in the body where you can feel empty space—  the nostrils, the mouth, and the ears can offer insight into the air element.
0 Begin by getting comfortable. You may want to sit or lie down. Close your eyes, or focus your gaze on one spot in the room.  Start to relax your body, beginning with your feet. Allow a feeling of relaxation to fill your feet...feeling heavy, loose, and relaxed. Relax your ankles...lower legs...and knees.  Allow the relaxation to continue, relaxing your upper legs. Let the muscles of your legs completely let go...feeling very heavy and relaxed.  Relax your hips and pelvis, and all the surrounding muscles. Feel your stomach and lower back relaxing...the muscles giving up their hold.  Feel the relaxation in your chest, back, and sides...feeling very relaxed...very heavy.  Let your hands relax, all the way from your fingertips to your wrists. Feel your lower arms relaxing...letting go. Relax your elbows and upper arms...loose and heavy.  Relax your shoulders, feeling them lowering slightly...finding a comfortable, relaxed position...free from tension...  Allow the muscles of your neck to relax...letting go...and relax your face and head.  Feel your entire body relaxing even more deeply...becoming completely relaxed...limp...heavy...comfortable.  Now turn your attention inward...even more deeply inside...to find your authentic self.  Begin by reflecting upon your values. What is the most important to you in life? What do you value? Where does your sense of right and wrong come from? Spend the next few moments thinking about your values.  (Pause)  The values you have been thinking of make up part of the core of who you are. If you are being true to your values, these core beliefs will drive your behavior.  It feels good to behave in ways that are consistent with your values. For example, if honesty is something you value, this could be reflected in your life by being truthful. If you value your family, perhaps your life reflects this in the time you spend with family members.  Think about how your values can be a part of your day-to-day life.   (Pause)  Now consider what else makes you who you are. Finding your authentic self involves learning who you truly are. Your authentic self is the real you, the person you are truly meant to be. Your authentic self is the person you are the core, the person you can be if nothing holds you back.  Imagine the person you believe yourself to be right now. It's okay if you aren't quite sure who you are...just picture yourself going about the things you usually do in a typical day. Imagine that you are watching yourself...observing yourself going about your usual activities.  See yourself getting up in the morning...going about your day...imagine the things that you do in a typical day. See yourself doing these activities.  Picture this person...you...standing in an empty room. Imagine watching this person...observe...now imagine you could strip away all the things that hold you back from your full potential. Imagine self-doubt dissolving...being replaced with confidence and self-assurance. Picture this person before you, and imagine all the things that get in the way of success...such as circumstances, lack of resources, lack of forgiveness, illness, baggage from the past...anything that is holding this person back in any way at all...   See these problems dissolving...disappearing...going away...  Now imagine this person, standing in the empty room. What is left? Who is this person when all those barriers are stripped away?  This person is you. Imagine who you are at the core...the pure character that is left when there is nothing to get in the way of complete self-expression.  You may only have a vague picture in your mind right now...let's allow that picture to come into focus...becoming more clear...  Think of your motivations...what motivates you? What drives your behavior? What catches your interest...or has caught your interest in the past? What propels you to action?  Think about your personality and character traits...the characteristics that are left when all barriers are removed and all fears have gone away. At your fullest potential, your simplest form...with no fears...what traits do you have? Think about your energy...are you laid back and calm, or are you energetic? Think about your other characteristics...  Are you introverted or extroverted?  Quiet or talkative?  Are you creative?  Are you practical?  What sorts of things do you appreciate?  What do you admire?  What do you like?  Imagine something that makes you feel happy...what is it?  Think of some things you enjoy...things that you like to do...  Think about all the characteristics of the person who is left when all barriers and fears are removed.  (Pause)  Now let's create a different picture. Imagine yourself as a young child, in a happy moment. See the potential in this child. Who is this young person? What makes this child who he or she is?  (Pause)  Think about the characteristics that you share with this child. In what ways are you similar? In what ways does the current you differ from this child? Think about how you have learned and grown since the time you were a small child.  (Pause)  Now picture yourself as the child...see the world through your younger self's eyes.  What did you want to be when you grew up? What hopes did you have for your future self? What dreams did you have as a child?  The hopes and dreams you had as a child were probably related in some way to your authentic self. Something about your dreams was connected to a part of your true self. What do these aspirations say about who you are? What personal characteristics of yours are related to your childhood dreams?  For example, if as a child you dreamed about becoming an astronaut, you probably have some personality traits that relate to this dream...such as being adventurous, curious, analytical...  Think about your own childhood dreams, and see what these dreams say about who you are.  (Pause)  Now create one final picture in your mind. Imagine, in as much detail as you can, the person you want to be. Imagine your ideal self...  How would this person behave? What does this person, your authentic self, value? What motivates this ideal self? What personal characteristics are present in this ideal version of you? Imagine all the details of the person you most want to be.  (Pause)  The image in your mind right now, of this ideal person, is you. This is your authentic self. This is who you are. At the core, beneath all of life's getting in the way...this is you.  Spend a few moments with this image of your authentic self.  Now allow yourself to step inside this image, and fully become this person. Become who you are. For this moment, just be...simply be your authentic self.  Feel a sense of calm and serenity...secure in who you are...knowing who you are. This is you. Your authentic self.  You can take this authentic self with you...allowing this true essence of you to shine through in everyday life. Allow your values, personality, and motivations to shine though...to guide your behavior...to make up who you are.  You have always been this person...you always will be your authentic self...a positive, confident person. A person you like and appreciate. Underneath the challenges, the baggage, the demands of living life...this is the real you that will always be with you.  (Pause)  It's time to reawaken now...to conclude this relaxation exercise...  Keep the image of your authentic self with you as you go about the rest of your day. Express this true self...and allow you to simply be you.  Wiggle your fingers, waking up your hands and arms...  Move your toes, allowing your feet and legs to wake up...  Feel your muscles reawakening...and your whole body filling with energy.  Open your eyes and sit quietly for a moment while you reorient to your surroundings...  When you are completely awake and alert, you can return to your usual activities, feeling confident and calm, in touch with your authentic self.

bringing noise to your awareness listen to the sound of my voice to be in a relaxed state in this present moment what is the subtlest sound that you can detect when you listen even if you have headphones on maybe you can detect a quiet buzz on the recording or some other sound in the background what would it be like to let the sounds around you come to you rather than working to search them out are you able to hear your own sounds the sounds of your breathing this is the practice of observation without judgment it is not about what you find but that you are looking let these sounds be your teacher of the present moment experience rather than a distraction begin to let the intensity of your listening fade as if the sounds blur into the background of your focus  and then become aware of what you can see while you likely have your eyes closed do you see blackness on the inside of your eyelids or do you detect the smallest amount of light coming through maybe you can see patches or swirls of color  take a moment to notice all that you can see  inviting your attention now to move to your sense of smell notice the most prevalent smell you can detect  perhaps it is the scent of your body care products or maybe there are flowers in the room or maybe you are simply aware that there seems to be no specific smell around you  remember this is about bringing your awareness into the present moment by noticing your senses rather than judging or labeling good or bad  let your awareness move now to anything you can taste do you notice the faint taste of toothpaste or a minty gum  perhaps you're aware of the taste of your last drink or meal still lingering inside your mouth or you may simply notice the wet sensation in your mouth allow your awareness to notice what your physical body is experiencing now feel the sensation that draws your attention most prominently again no need to judge or label good or bad just notice [Music] notice the areas where your body meets the support beneath you become aware of where your clothes or your hair subtly brush your skin [Music] since the energy where one part of your body is touching another part can you sense the vibrations of your energy what do you feel at the palms of your hands is there energy vibrations or a sense of buzzing there [Music] do you feel a certain temperature in your fingertips often times we can connect to our own innate energy simply by attending to the energy of our hands what is the volume of what your body is telling you are there areas that are louder than others asking for you to listen are there any subtle messages being offered within you [Music] as you are attending to the sense of touch in various ways take a moment to soften and release anywhere you can since the shift in your body [Music] [Music] it is often said there is a sixth sense the sense is the power of perception similar but not one of the five physical senses it is a strong intuitive power by connecting with your feelings and emotions during meditation you can develop this instinct or sixth sense listen inward for what you are feeling right now is there contentment or peace [Music] what are the other qualities you are aware of when you quietly observe look inward not inwards or labels but in sensations and feelings without judgment these sensations and the awareness of the sensations the listening inward it allows you to connect with your body and your heart listen to your heart what do you hear from your heart right now [Music] it's okay if it seems nothing is coming to you now it will this is the practice of present moment observation and opening to the possibilities of what you may find [Music] we practice witnessing the present moment because stress is experienced when living in the past or the future peace is found right here right now move towards peace take a moment longer to notice your senses again perhaps you can become aware of all of your senses at the same time or choose to scan through them each again  take another deep breath with your eyes still closed as you slowly invite your field of awareness to broaden outward once more notice sounds sights smells tastes and feelings  as you are beginning to open your field of awareness and sense your surroundings see if you can do so while you continue to stay connected with your inner experience and when you feel ready gradually let a little light in through your eyes and take in your surroundings once more continue to practice using your senses to come to the present moment any time throughout your day to experience a sense of peace in the now thank you so much for practicing with me today I hope you have a peaceful and calm day
0 welcome to the daily calm let's start today's session by finding a comfortable position with a tall straight back allow your arms to rest gently when you're ready close your eyes bring full attention to this very moment settling in and allowing the mind and body to still and with openness patience and curiosity bring your awareness to the breath a deep breath in and releasing it fully follow the breath as it flows in and out of your body taking one last deep breath before letting the breath settle allowing it to feel natural and easy don't try to force the breath or regulate it in any way just allow it to flow naturally on its own so and we'll scan down the body now concentrating our attention from part to part start by bringing your attention to the top of your head and scalp feeling whatever's happening in this area you might feel tingling or heat throbbing or soft vibrations there may be strong sensation or you might not feel much at all now lower your attention to your forehead face and jaw allow the muscles here to relax on your next out breath let that sensation dissolve lower your focus to the neck letting the throat and sides and back of the neck soften notice any sensation that arises on the surface of the skin or deeper within now bring your attention to your shoulders noticing if there's any tension or strain breathe into your shoulders and if any parts feel tight allow them to relax extend your awareness down the arms towards the wrists palms and fingers on the next out breath allow them to soften now come to the chest observing the rise and fall of each breath notice how the lungs expand and contract direct your attention to your upper and lower back there may be some intensity is this is an area where we commonly hold stress if you notice any tension or warmth or discomfort just observe what's there with each breath you take soften just a little bit more moving your focus around your abdomen notice it expanding filling up with air and slowly emptying on the exhale and bring your attention to your pelvis notice where your body makes contact with the ground or your chair and direct your breath into this area relaxing into stillness now scan your legs observing your thighs notice where they make contact with your cushion or chair lowering your attention to your knees and your shins and calves let your legs soften intentions release when you're ready breathe into your ankles your feet and toes let them relax and become soft sinking into a state of relaxed awareness and as we near the end of the session take a moment to notice how you feel you may find that you're more relaxed as this is often a common outcome of meditation this is one of the reasons why it's so helpful to meditate during times of stress when we're experiencing stress our amygdala fires up and it's difficult to make thoughtful decisions so if we find our mind is clouded due to overwhelm we can use meditation as a tool to calm the mind down ideally we want to meditate in a preventative way so we don't get to that point the practice is here for you whenever you need it and as we near the end of the session bring your attention back to the room wiggle your fingers and toes and slowly open your eyes i hope you enjoyed today's daily con i invite you to bring this state of peace with you into the day and we'll see you back here tomorrow you
0 hey dear love if you're experiencing negative thoughts that's okay allow yourself to be okay with the not okayness and with that energy around you give yourself permission to get into whatever position feels comfortable for you and when you feel ready gently close your eyes turn your awareness towards your breath i really want you to focus on your belly throughout this meditation allow your lower abdomen to expand on every inhale and contract on every exhale all the while allowing your upper chest to remain relatively calm still and neutral this helps signal to our body that we are safe it's okay to slow down it's also okay to listen to whatever quote unquote negative thoughts that are going on within you because truly the only way to release them is to love them you don't need to love the thoughts so much as love yourself through the thoughts a simple example before we begin the practice is to not think about the color green [Music] what happens when i tell you to not think about the color green [Music] very often when we're told not to think of something or we try to not think of something we just think about it more [Music] when we instead shift our focus [Music] that's when we can start to change but it all begins with acceptance and love so whatever the key prominent negative message that has been coming up for you is present simply let it be as you turn into your breath remember stomach expands on every inhale and contracts on every exhale let yourself know that you are not this thought and it's okay that it showed up all of our quote unquote negative thoughts are actually just teachers in disguise so recognize if only for a moment you are separate from this thought imagine that it is just a scared wounded part of your own child-like self and extend love towards it for whatever piece of you had this thought is likely tied to some scared wound within a frightened inner child show love and compassion towards yourself for whatever you're feeling tied to these negative emotions let yourself know you are here for yourself you are here to love and accept yourself no matter what thoughts come to mind no matter what emotions are caused by the thoughts and vice versa you've got your back loving yourself in this way may bring about an emotional reaction of some kind simply allow whatever you experience if it feels good to you you may even embrace yourself wrapping your arms around yourself [Music] letting yourself know it's okay you're here for you you love and accept yourself no matter what thoughts or emotions are present you're not here to push them away you're not here to judge them or beat yourself up for them you are here to love yourself through them [Music] as you offer up this love and acceptance towards whatever thoughts are present again if there's multiple select just one right now for the purpose of this next step that negative thought is [Music] tune in to what emotions it may bring up for you if your arms are still wrapped around you you may choose to keep them there or let them come back down to your sides trust whatever feels best to you [Music] and as you let yourself be present with both this thought and emotion you allow yourself to get clear on what its opposite would be for example a common negative thought i've experienced is that i'm not good enough [Music] and the emotions accompanying our despair and doubt the opposite would be that i am good enough i am more than enough and the emotions would be trust optimism practice this with yours identify what the opposite of your negative statement is now identify what the opposite of your negative emotions are [Music] now now that you know this new positive statement and feeling you can recognize that those those emotions those statements we were referring to as negative were actually just teachers guiding you back towards this desire you have a desire to feel the way that you just identified [Music] we don't have negative thoughts about things we don't care about they're just showing us where we really care about something [Music] tune into that positive statement you just created the opposite of the negative statement you started with [Music] if it feels good to you say this new statement out loud [Music] if possible make it an i am statement [Music] how do you feel saying this if it still does not quite feel true you can say i am willing to believe followed by your new statement give that a try i am willing to believe link fill in the blank with your new positive statement notice how this willingness to shift into this new positive statement feels as you start to make this shift into more positive thoughts you gain momentum thereby attracting even more positive thoughts anytime you feel yourself slipping into thoughts that are perhaps considered more negative be grateful towards them for their only being guide posts showing you where you are able to look more closely at your desires in fact take the initial negative thoughts that you switched in this practice and begin to feel gratitude towards it it helped you identify this new desire this new positive affirmation you also start to extend gratitude towards yourself for you showed up as an alchemist today you sat in your power and transformed fear to love say thank you to yourself for this if it feels good to you you may give yourself another warm embrace and you can return to this process over and over again with any unwanted thoughts you are fully capable of transforming them into gold [Music] take this feeling with you as you begin to roll your shoulders wiggle your fingers and toes really focusing on this new positive statement and when you're ready slowly open your eyes back to the world around you amazing job today it's so powerful to look at your fears with love be proud of yourself for doing this and know that we are proud of you too and we're so thankful to you for being here we so hope this served if you feel cold share your new positive statement below and we can all hold space for the positive statements see you in the next meditation you
0 thank you for being here dear soul i'm kenneth and from my heart i welcome you to this guided meditation you can make yourself as comfortable as you can right now in this moment allow yourself to just be here and now observing the words i share with you like a soft breeze on a summer night noticing whatever it is that you notice your body may begin to relax more and more as you listen to my voice and go deeper within trust that your body can find its best way to let go naturally don't need to relax it may be that your body needs to heal in other ways it's good to know that your unconscious mind is an expert in healing and balancing in a safe and natural way while you can just flow with the experience change is a natural aspect of life like a tree that lets go of its leaves the seasons changing the sea changing from liquid to air [Music] and become aware of your breathing imagine now that you're breathing in that life energy through the soles of your feet breathing it up through your body and breathing out the top of your head breathing in through the soles of your feet breathing out the top of your head and out of your fingertips and some people notice that life energy like a tingling sensation or numb sensation in their feet or in their hands or fingertips [Music] there is no right or wrong way to flow with this experience there is an old story about a buddha statue perhaps your arms and feet will get heavier as you listen to this story and you can enjoy that in your own way because people can you know experience a pleasant deepening sense of comfort as they allow their body to relax and they relax deeply in the mid 50s a monastery was to be relocated to make room for a new highway the monks arranged for a crane to come and move a 10 feet tall clay buddha to its new location when the crane started to lift the statue it was much heavier than expected and it began to crack wanting to protect the priceless shrine the monks lowered it back down and decided to wait until the next day to bring more powerful equipment to add insult to the injury the rain came in so the monks covered the statue with tarps to keep the moisture away in the dark of night the head monk took his flashlight and went out to make sure the buddha was still covered when the light of the flashlight shone into the crack of the clay he saw a glimmer a reflection of something underneath the shroud of clay he immediately started to carefully chisel away shards of clay to find that the glimmer grew brighter hours later when all the clay had been removed he was in the presence of a buddha made of solid gold as you continue to listen the positive and valuable words i will share with you now have already started to activate a process of chiseling away old clay of worries fear stress and anxiety in your subconscious mind and this will continue with every second and every minute with every breath now i wonder if you can imagine yourself walking on a warm beach this can be any beach you like either one you imagine or a beach you know you are there by yourself imagine walking so close to the sea that some of the waves touch your feet i don't know what you notice the most if it's the sound of the waves maybe it's the sight of the sea the sky the sand or maybe it's the warmth the feeling of sand and water on your skin or maybe it's that fresh clean and high vibrational air or a combination suddenly you realize that there is a thick rope tied around your waist behind you at the end of the rope there is a big old anchor that weighs heavy from accumulated thoughts worries and fears from the past and about the future they hinder you they have held you back berated you from inner peace and harmony from joy and freedom the rope is going into your skin with each step in front of you now further ahead something glimmering in the sand catches your attention you walk towards it dragging that heaviness with you when you come closer to it you realize that it is a blade it looks and feels like it is from ancient times like there is an energy link between you and that blade [Music] and suddenly you notice your name appears on the handle of that blade while a part of you is curious your higher self knows that this blade is here for a reason like life has given you an opportunity chance a choice to deliberately cut the rope and let it all go cut the rope now let go of all the worries and unwanted feelings you've been dragging with you [Music] maybe you feel a sense of relief a sense of freedom lightness or something else maybe your body is working through this in its own way some people even shed tears and shake a bit when they finally let go the way you go through this is the way that is right for you and it is safe for you to let go now imagine the waves crashing into the anchor as it starts to magically rust to pieces right before your very eyes it is safe for you to let go now the anchor disappears more and more with each new wave the rope dissolves while it floats further and further from shore imagine the sun surrounding you with a radiant light energy shining down enveloping you filling you with a peaceful silence and quietness which flows through your veins permeating every cell in your body feel every atom every molecule of your body mind and spirit allowing yourself to be healed and balanced becoming very aware of that deep sense of peacefulness inside you as you do so and i'll leave you in silence for a few moments as your body mind heart and spirit continues the process of letting go and heal and you're doing good [Music] the sun is communicating these compassionate words with every atom every molecule of your body mind and spirit you can feel calm now and balanced and this calmness and sense of balance is going to grow and grow each day more and more more focused peaceful and calm while your subconscious mind is enjoying and absorbing all the beneficial suggestions that i am giving you in a safe and natural way and you're doing doing good you are taking control of your mind body and emotions you are feeling better and better feeling calm harmonious relaxed at all times that calmness that inner peace is growing and spreading through and around your body and as you continue to relax the things in life that were not giving you a positive experience now they seem to calm you now they seem to make you stronger now they seem to connect you with your inner strength and power whatever you experience in life you are bigger than that you are a part of something much bigger than yourself you choose to show up in your life and honor the opportunity that you have been given you are pure life force in human body you are life you are worthy [Music] that you start walking forwards along the beach leaving footprints in the sand the sun still beaming its powerful celestial energy upon your being you feel surprisingly more free imagine that every step every footprint represents patterns that are not supportive of your intention to live your full potential [Music] and it is safe for you to let go now let go now so you walk steadily and courageously towards your new future after a while you turn around maybe you notice that your footprints are being washed away by the waves your first steps are gone now washed away [Music] let go now and it is safe and you're doing good good for each step you take the lighter and more free you feel walking more and more effortlessly towards your new future much more free ahead of you there is a person approaching it is you it is you one month from now notice how relaxed that future you feels notice how good that future you feels that balanced energy is emanating from that you over there the future you comes towards you and gives you the warmest most compassionate hug that you have felt in a long time all that love that love unconditionally flowing between you the future you says thank you thank you for taking care of me i love you thank you for being so compassionate to me thank you for loving me and accepting me for who i am [Music] the effect of these positive words will be reinforced in your dreams compounded in your sleep you'll wake up tomorrow feeling marvelous looking forward to another great day in your life you feel confident to do all the things you want to do and it's getting easier and easier and situations that used to bother you now they just seem to make you stronger they seem to connect you with your inner power and it's getting easier and easier you are understanding the bigger picture

always find surprisingly good solutions and your ability to conquer challenges is limitless your potential to succeed is infinite you can feel that inner power and harmony now to do the things you want to do and this inner power is growing when you sleep in your dreams you feel calm strong confident and relaxed each day as you become increasingly more able to let go and relax so you feel a sense of calmness a sense of peacefulness growing inside you and this growing feeling of inner calmness and quiet confidence is sufficient to reassure you that as each day passes you are more and more

0 thanks for joining me today for another mindful tip today i want to chat about stress a little bit you probably at some point in your life have experienced stress anxiety maybe panic maybe sensations of air hunger freak out whatever you want to call it and if you have it you probably know someone that has stress is really important to our physiology it's something that we actually rely on to survive in many ways unfortunately in today's world the mechanisms around stress can can backfire in some way so what used to help us stay alive can often you know the same elegant mechanism designed for that can backfire and kind of disregulate our nervous system so you know acute stress is really useful but over time chronic stress even if it's a low grade can really disregulate our autonomic nervous system and that could influence our breathing patterns and what happens is once our breathing pattern is affected negatively it could kind of feed back into that loop meaning now that you're not breathing uh optimally that leads to more chronic stress because breathing poorly whether it's you know your mechanics of breathing or like how many breaths you take in a minute or so forth though that in itself can be a stress and can kind of feed that loop now the cool thing is is we we could interact with that mechanism somewhat simply so today i wanted to give like one style of breathing that i find really useful from an application standpoint in everyday life now the breath pattern i'm gonna talk about today there's they're styles that have been used that tap into the same mechanism for a really long time so if you study yogic breath patterns you know a lot of them cultivate the same qualities that this does but sometimes to really practice those thoroughly you want to be in a fairly controlled environment you want to be sitting still in a room you want to have probably no responsibilities on your calendar for the next 20-30 minutes whereas what i'd like to talk about today i feel can be inserted into your life a lot easier uh more often for less amount of time so the application um you know really presents an opportunity for us when we're trying to navigate the stresses especially acute stresses of our life especially if you tend towards like anxiety panic and sometimes feelings or sensations of air hunger like you can't get enough breath oftentimes what happens when we feel that way we can make things worse by breathing faster or deeper everybody's heard the term you know relax take a deep breath and in some ways that could be helpful but there's also ways where that deep breath if it's rapid can exacerbate our situation so this pattern probably falls under the style of buteyko breathing that you might be familiar with and if you're not i definitely recommend a deep dive in that realm and it taps into one of the qualities that i think is important to develop and kind of it's important muscle to flex and that would be carbon dioxide tolerance so carbon dioxide is often thought of as like a waste product that's not useful to us but it's actually really important when dealing with anxiety or stress and carbon dioxide is a excuse me i got some critters behind me making noise carbon dioxide is a signaling molecule that our body relies on it plays a role in regulating the ph of our body and in doing so it signals our body's release of oxygen from hemoglobin into our tissues so oftentimes when we're breathing poorly because we're stressed or if we're stressed because we're breathing poorly we'll have a sensation like we're not getting enough air and sometimes that means because our oxygen is low and our carbon dioxide is high but in building tolerance to that level of carbon dioxide we can shift those sensations so we could shift the experience that we have in the moment to what we feel like we're not getting enough air to a place where we feel calm and that our breathing is not a problem it's kind of a fascinating concept that seems contradictory at first until you try it and some folks will struggle when trying this at least at first but it works it's really great i personally have relied on it many times and i think it's an important tool to have in our tool kit when things just arrive in our day-to-day situation where we notice that you know our breathing is off and we're and we're feeling stressed and on the edge of anxiety or panic the idea here in general is to slow down your breath to take fewer breaths and the way i like to do this and the way i've taught many folks where they could successfully integrate it is by first focusing on the inhale so as you're inhaling to try to take in your breath slower so the tendency might be to breathe more and to breathe faster so that you can breathe more but to actually do the opposite which could feel uncomfortable at first and what you're looking to do is kind of flirt with this edge of discomfort where it's a little uncomfortable but you can do it and if at any point it's too uncomfortable you could take a deep breath breathe naturally and kind of reset and start over but think of your breath being like a wave where you have an inhale and an exhale and the idea here is to slow down that inhale maybe not take as much air and then let your exhale kind of drag out and some folks will even try to create a little breath hold at the end of the exhale which is useful but not necessary so a good place to start if you want to apply structure so you have something to focus on like a count what i recommend would be to breathe in for a count of three and out for a count of three and very quickly let the exhale become longer so maybe your desire would be to breathe in for four or five but like slow that down don't take as much air in and then try to relax the body on the exhale so you're taking that wave and you're making it smaller in height essentially and stretching it out so the goal would be to eventually take fewer breaths over a given amount of time by slowing them down one thing that also might help focusing on this is the sound that your breath makes generally if you take a deep or fast breath it'll have an audible sound that you could hear from i don't know from the inside of your head somewhere so think of breathing where it doesn't really make a sound so slowing it down where there's not a lot of wind your breath is creating and not a lot of sound that it's generating so very slow soft inhale and then on the exhale over your breath cycles allowing that to drag out longer and longer and what i like to do on that exhale is try to relax my body so maybe starting with the stomach somewhere that feels somewhat central to where the activity of the breath is and relaxing it maybe relaxing the belly maybe relaxing the neck or shoulders if there's an area that you know you have a tendency of holding tension maybe focusing on relaxing that area on the exhale and if you can get to a point where you're in for three and maybe out for 9 or 10 or 12 which might take a few sessions to to get to what i find happens is within a fairly short period of time the way your nervous system feels like it's being expressed it just transforms so you can go to a place that you know you're on edge you're stressed right now in this moment feeling sensations of anxiety right now and within just a few minutes um really coming out to a different place where that sensation has really diminished which is an exciting thing it's like another example of what role we could play in our sense of well-being now this could be done really in any position i think because of the nature of how this is just slowly incorporated you can do this while you you're walking uh you know you're on a walk you can do it seated um i would maybe be careful doing it when driving but you know it could be integrated in a lot of different positions like wherever your orientation is it could even be played with during light levels of exercise movement if you're having difficulty doing it especially if you have the tendency of really breathing up here where your sternum and your shoulders are lifting on your inhale and you struggle with getting your breath to go more south in direction the thing the position that i feel is most useful would be laying prone meaning laying on your belly and what that does is it allows gravity to the weight of your body to kind of hold your rib cage in place a little bit so that you're there's there's a lot of movement in your ribs when you breathe but ideally it's not so much north it's more east west so when you're laying on your belly the weight of your body can hold your sternum in place a little bit and it allows it easier to direct your breath more downward and expand more laterally so if you find yourself having trouble with this from a seated or standing or walking position then just just lay down especially in the moment if you're in a moment where you're really experiencing anxiety and you want to see what you're capable of doing don't worry about trying to do it in a more i don't want to say advanced but you know while you're doing something else just lay down on your belly you could just put one hand on top of the other put your forehead on your hands or maybe if it's more comfortable turn your head to the side and put a cheek on your hands and just focus on slowing your inhale and then letting your exhale get longer and longer every cycle and trying to relax your body on that exhale it's a very effective pattern i encourage you to give it a try practice it when you're not in a place of anxiety or stress so that you feel a little bit more comfortable and then see if you could remember in the moment where you are experiencing uh increased stress or anxiety you know you could say oh i know what to do now i've practiced this and then go for it and then please let the community know what you notice so maybe in the comments you know give it a try and let us know what what you experience when you practice this pattern and if you want to learn more about different styles that tap in to these concepts the school of book tako breathing is an excellent resource and it's not hard to find information or videos about that so i hope you enjoyed this uh this tip and if you know someone that experiences anxiety and stress on a regular basis especially if it's like sensations of panic and air hunger this is a very useful strategy so please send it their way i hope you enjoyed have a great day
0 - [Narrator] Hi, and welcome to this meditation for self-love. (gentle meditative music) I'd like to invite you to gently close your eyes and take a nice, slow, deep breath in, deeper than you've taken all day so far. And as you exhale, concentrate on the sound of my voice, allowing it to ground you into the present moment. And give yourself permission right now to focus on you, making yourself your first priority. There's nowhere else you need to be. There's nothing else you need to be doing, except giving yourself this time for your own care, for your own well-being. Continue breathing, allowing each inhale to be a bit deeper than the one before it, feeling your lungs expand out as you inhale, and feeling everything contract back in as you exhale. Returning your breath now to its normal pattern and its normal rhythm, but continue to follow the journey of your breath through your entire body. Feeling it weave in and out of your muscles and your cells. Allowing it to still you, and ease any tension or tightness you may be feeling. Now I'd like you to turn your attention to the bottom half of your body, everything from your hips all the way down to the tips of your toes. Breathing into them. Noticing any judgments that come up about any of these areas. We all have parts of our body that we wish were different, but instead of judging them, now turn your focus to sending love and appreciation into these areas. Shifting your focus now to your upper body, from your stomach to the crown of your head, feeling into these areas, noticing any tension or tightness you may be having, breathing into that area to help it release. Noticing any judgments that come up in these areas. And gently, replacing that judgment with love and appreciation. And now begin to call to mind other parts of yourself that you've held in judgment in the past, maybe a thought pattern or a behavior you exhibited. Maybe it was a choice you made, or something you said you wish you could take back. Maybe a time where you felt you could have handled something better. Look at it from a place of total curiosity. Watch the judgment come up, because it will, and watch the stories that you've told yourself about the situation come up, because they will, too. And then gently let those go, and offer yourself forgiveness, knowing that you were doing the best you could at that time. And now as we move into the silent part of the meditation, continue this journey on your own, calling to mind any parts of yourself that you hold in judgment, and giving them unconditional love, acceptance, and forgiveness. Continue breathing with your eyes closed. Let your attention start to focus back on my voice. When we judge parts of ourself, we actually hold them separate from us, and if we're holding parts of ourself separate, then we can't feel whole. Real self love is holding our light with the dark, of loving those parts of ourselves unconditionally we previously held in judgment. No one else can do this for us. Give yourself all the love that you need. It's inside you. Now let's take three more deep breaths together, a deep inhale in, holding it for a beat, and exhale it out. Again, an even deeper breath than the one before, feeling that breath weave in and out of all of your muscles and cells. And exhale out. Last time, your deepest breath yet, sending that oxygen all the way down to the tips of your toes, and as you exhale, feel it traveling back up your body, and when it hits the top of your head, and you're ready, you can open your eyes. Thank you for joining me for this meditation and giving yourself this gift.

Allow yourself to just be here and now, letting your body just be.  You don't have to do anything because our bodies naturally want to be calm and relaxed.  Sometimes thinking too much or being tense and being anxious doesn’t allow for us to relax.  So naturally, we must let go of any need to control the present moment and future outcomes.  We feel anxious because we tend to over-analyze what we think will happen today, tomorrow or next week.  We do this out of habit because in the past, situations and outcomes that didn’t happen the way we expected, and we tend to feel that we need to be in control and be worried.  In order to change this habit, we must change our self-image and create new beliefs.  That's what this session will teach you, but first, we need to get in a relaxed state and go within, calming our mind with some breathing.  I will count down and with it number I say I want to fully inhale with your belly out and exhale tightening your belly.  And with each breath, you will feel more and more relaxed, taking you into a deep state of peace.  I will count down now.  5...Take a full in breath and as you exhale feel the tension loosen a little bit.  4...Take a nice deep breath in and as you exhale you feel even more relaxed and tensions let go.  3...Full breath in...and out.  Your mind is becoming calm and clear.  2...Inhale deeply and when you exhale observe how the need to control subsides as you become extremely relaxed.  1...As you take your last breath and exhale slowly you feel any tension is gone, and you are in complete peace and tranquility.
0 So, to reduce anxiety, start by taking a moment to relax your body.. soften any unnecessary tension in your belly and shoulder, and find a posture that feels both relaxed and alert.  Now close your eyes or look downwards and rest your hands in an easy effortless way.  Take a few moments to scan your awareness through the sensations of your body, and wherever possible, soften and release obvious areas of physical tension.  Relax your breath, and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. This may be a little unfamiliar, but when done is a natural, easy going way, it can be a very relaxing way to breathe.  In through your nose and out through your mouth.  In through your nose and out through your mouth.  Now let your belly be soft. If the belly is soft, more oxygen goes to the bottom of the lungs.  There’s better oxygen exchange.  Oxygen moves more easily into the blood, and it goes to all the cells in the body, including the cells in the brain, supplying your brain with the nourishment it needs.  If the belly is soft, it helps to activate the vagus nerve.  Vagus means wandering, and this nerve wanders up through the abdomen and chest, back to the central nervous system in the brain, and it promotes relaxation.  It is an antidote to the fight or flight stress response.
0 the idea of being in the present moment is a powerful one when it comes to anxiety depression and calming an overactive mind depression can arise when thinking about and living in the past anxiety can show up when thinking about and living in the future when your thoughts are in the past or the future an overthinking mind can bring turmoil to your world and your overall experience today release these feelings calm the overactive mind and experience peace in this present moment this mindfulness meditation can be used to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past and anxieties about the future hello and welcome I'm Sara Raymond here at the mindful movement we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing let's begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable feel free to sit or lie down so you can experience ease yet remain alert we will start this meditation with your eyes open with a soft gaze focus your line of vision on one point in front of you this can be a spot on the floor or the wall whatever draws your attention narrow your focus on this one single point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away see all there is to notice about this one point now slowly broaden your field of view like a camera lens widening with a relaxed awareness notice everything you can see in your current line of you without turning your head notice colors textures different materials and now slowly narrow your field of view once more to the same single point that you started with and as your focus continues to narrow draw it in until your eyes gradually closed and you allow your attention to turn inward [Music] as you begin to look inside and settle physically start with three deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth like a sigh take these three breaths at your own pace welcoming a slowing down of the momentum of your energy to gradually find stillness [Music] now begin to count your breath in then as you breathe out encourage your exhale to be one count longer than your inhale [Music] allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress and tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will slow and your body will calm down [Music] you can consciously relax do this for a few more breaths cycles on your own now enjoy the easy flow of your natural breath feel the cool air as it passes in through your nostrils and fills you up [Music] encourage each natural out-breath to release any remaining tension you may be feeling as you observe your breath you can allow it to naturally slow down become aware of your physical experience [Music] with your minds I notice first the palms of your hands notice the energy here perhaps you feel this as warmth or tingling or a buzzing sensation notice how simply moving your awareness to this part of your body moves your energy to this point by simply paying attention you have the ability to move energy and move a positive sensation within you similar to broadening your visual focal point begin to widen the experience of your sensations outward moving from your hands to awaken to the sensations in your body since the aliveness in your hands and in your feet feel the energy moving within you let your attention drift through the sensations in your body without directing it and without judging what you find and by you're moving attention on your body to direct your energy and your thoughts simply allow your focus to tune into the sensations of your body right here right now [Music] when you can do this live in this body since your own aliveness you are in the present and living in the space between your thoughts when your mind is attentive to the sensations of your body you can pause you can extend the gap between your thoughts in this space is where you can experience peace and calm [Music] notice if there is anywhere you can soften a little more look for anywhere you can let go even deeper into relaxation and ease let your physical body go so that you can let your thoughts go and now as I say each part of your body let your focus move to each part and encourage or release a complete relaxation to find ease in your body by simply moving your awareness throughout your body as I mentioned each part allow the surface below you to support you fully so there is no need to hold your position and you can be completely relaxed become aware of your feet notice this area and simply relax move your attention up from your feet and begin to release your lower legs and knees feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and goes deeper into relaxation as you allow it to let go and now find a sense of ease in your thighs and hips as you let go completely moving up noticing the area of your lower back and abdomen take a deep breath to move your energy and attention here to release any tightness in your lower back continue this process of increasing your comfort by moving your attention and therefore your energy as you do this welcome a feeling of softening into your abdomen let your chest and arms rest heavy on the surface below you moving your attention upward feel as your neck and throat release any physical and emotional tension you may be holding on to notice now the hinges of your jaw allow your jaw to unclench relaxing deeper and deeper still feel as the small muscles of your cheeks eyes and forehead soften and they go you may notice that as the small muscles in your face and jaw let go the rest of your body follows and softens even more still now your whole body is heavy relaxed and that ease you may sense that you are safe and supported and you are open to guiding yourself into a calm state of mind let yourself go let your mind and body go to a deep and relaxed State [Music] and now that you are fully relaxed you can begin the inward inquiry process by checking in with what is true for you notice what you are actually feeling giving yourself permission to experience in this present moment without trying to change anything let your thoughts come and go there is no need to attach to them or follow your thoughts imagine your thoughts are like a river flowing gently downstream let your thoughts go so you can be here now awake to the sensations in your body let your thoughts go so you can make room for the truth to surface in whatever form a comes simply allow it to surface make space for awareness and acceptance without judgment [Music] whatever you're feeling is okay these are simply patterns that have developed they are not you recognize any self talk going on in your mind and let your thoughts come and go allow yourself to move out of the thinking patterns and bring your attention to your felt experience no need to attach words or labels to your feelings simply explore what those feelings are pause and allow these feelings give yourself permission to be with this experience but your thoughts come and go [Music] if you find your mind drifting going back to old patterns of thinking or overthinking lovingly guide yourself back gesture your attention to come back to the present moment sensations once more being present is the way stay in the moment stay with the feelings and be okay with it continue to make space in your heart for whatever you are feeling and simply be stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment longer let your thoughts come and go continue to come back to the felt experience and move out of the thinking patterns and then take some time to nurture yourself place your hand on your heart if you like and offer love and kindness to yourself open your heart and let it in offer a positive energy to the area of your heart begin to deepen your breath once more allow your deepening breath to nurture yourself with care and compassion since an inner peace pause for just a moment longer to truly experience the positive sensations that are always within you when you are willing to slow down and look within when you slow down and stay with the sensations as long as you can you may find that you notice more you are able to live more fully without letting thoughts take over now as many times as you can look for what wants to be seen listen to what wants to be heard to do this slow down pause look inward look in between your thoughts quiet your thoughts to see hear and feel deeply inhabit your body fully and be open to life begin to reactivate each part of your body from its relaxed state feel the gentle refilling of energy back into your body awaken your body slowly and when you are ready open your eyes take this calm state with you as you go on with your day thank you so much for practicing with me I hope you have a peaceful day
0 getting upset about pain doesn't take it away thinking about and replaying the past doesn't give you the ability to change what has already occurred worrying wishing and hoping things were different doesn't make anything actually change today let go of the events of the day and surrender into a deep tranquil sleep give yourself permission to simply let go into your own inner peace and self-healing through acceptance and surrender it is a pleasure to be your guide today I'm Sara Raymond welcome to the mindful movement here we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner

allow yourself the opportunity to relax in stillness create a safe and tranquil environment for yourself making sure you are all set to drift off into sleep invite into your body and mind a sense of relaxation and peace you can drift off to sleep when you are ready there is no need to listen to everything I say let relaxation and sleep come to you easily welcoming a slowing down of the momentum of your energy to gradually find stillness begin to connect with your breath and if it feels right to you take a long slow deep breath in hold it for a moment and then slowly exhale fully empty out and allow any tension to melt away as you gradually relax more and more deeply with each breath as you continue to breathe intentionally allow your exhale to be slightly longer than your inhale to welcome ease and relaxation to flow throughout your entire body [Music] take another long slow deep breath in pausing again and then exhale empty your lungs completely with your out-breath [Music] and again take a deep breath in to signal to your body and mind that it is your time to fully relax take your time hold for a moment and then let it go perhaps you can already feel yourself drifting into a deep state of relaxation like the leaves being released from the trees in the season of fall you can let go to make room for new possibilities to develop and present themselves in your life [Music] consider each breath out as a time for releasing any unwanted energies and allowing the energy that you do desire to develop within you this is your time to heal and to let go with each exhale let go of any tension in your body scan for areas that are holding on to something and give yourself permission to let go of that tension with each exhale surrender to gravity let go of any resistance [Music] with each exhale let go and soften deeper and deeper into the surface below you allow your body to soften a little deeper now allow the out-breath to exhale tension from your body we'll let go of anything you might be holding on to from yesterday or earlier today [Music] let go of any to-do list that may be taking up space in your ID give yourself permission to be here right now doing just this sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission in order to let go of the past give yourself some space space for something new space to grow into what do you want to let go of right now [Music] what has become too heavy a weight to bear on your journey [Music] like the falling leaves it's time to clear out and free yourself of things you may have been afraid to let go of in the past without the falling of the leaves there can be no new growth let go of anger let go of guilt let go of grief [Music] let go of sadness let go of judgments let go of comparisons let go of shame [Music] let go of whatever is weighing you down these emotions may have served you in the past yet now it's okay to release them [Music] offer your awareness now to your physical body in this moment scan through the sensations of your body with a relaxed awareness free of judgement surrender any tension you may notice soften any areas you may be experiencing gripping or holding allow this surrendering to happen naturally throughout your body by simply offering your awareness to your body it is okay simply breathe and notice [Music] be aware of your inner physical experience just as it is you can allow yourself to simply be exactly as you are [Music] a peaceful mental state and an ease fulfill state are available when you are able to stop resisting your experience at any given moment when we want things to be different than they are that is when we develop resistance or tension today practice letting go of resistance be here now just as you are and you can get into the flow [Music] as you notice your body sensations accept them just as they are whether you may typically label these sensations as positive or negative settle into your body except being in your body right now just as you are be with the sensations you experience accepting all that you are there is no need to make a change during meditation be just as you are accepting allows you to fully experience what is happening in the present to fully engage in life [Music] listen to what your soul is sharing with you right now continue to be receptive to these sensations for a few moments longer with love and kindness for yourself feel the lightness that has washed over you as you have shed the weight that you have been carrying around for far too long we can learn from our faults and grow from our experiences if we allow them know that without experiencing suffering we also cannot experience joy without darkness we cannot know light allowing life just as it is can lessen any struggle and perhaps any additional and unnecessary suffering continue to soften soften from the surface all the way to deep within you release any guarding you may be holding on to surrender to anything you were holding on to for fear of losing let go of what could have been let go of worry of the possibility of a new way let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders let the sensations dissolve from your muscles every day we get a new chance to be in this moment it is okay simply breathe and notice surrender to the ability of your body to heal itself surrender to the love within you know your ability to give and to receive love surrender let go and be held by pure love trust you are loved in darkness and in light all of you is loved simply trust [Music] notice once more how you feel and allow yourself to feel just as you are for an even deeper connection with yourself surrender to your breath feel your body being breathed being moved by your breath trust it's okay simply breathe and notice [Music] notice the sounds in your environment just as they are here are the sounds as they come to you without searching them out allow the subtle noises to drift into your awareness with simple curiosity take interest in the sounds just as they are simply allow the sounds to be rather than seeing them as a distraction or an obstacle if you can practice accepting the sounds just as they are without the desire to change you can also begin to practice acceptance and surrender in other areas of your life frequently the word surrender has a negative energy to it you may think of having to give up something that is important to you or lose control over a situation Surrender does not mean giving up when the word surrender is used as a mindfulness practice it can also be the opportunity to give up anything that is no longer serving you or anything that is keeping you stuck [Music] consider this beautiful quote by Debbie Ford surrender is a gift that you can give yourself it's an act of faith it's saying that even though I can't see where the river is flowing I trust it will take me in the right direction [Music] any obstacle or challenge in your life might actually be taking you in the right direction allow the flow of the energy of life [Music] when you feel life brings you challenges you can't accept you have the opportunity to be transformed by acceptance you may add suffering when you resist the way things are because they aren't the way you expect or want them to be [Music] you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the way things are naturally there is a possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true peace is available when you stop resisting any given moment [Music] although you don't have control of what goes on beyond yourself you do have a choice as to how you respond to your experience and this choice gives you the opportunity to experience in our peace you can decide your attitude in any given circumstance noticing the sensations in your body with a relaxed awareness once more since that you now feel as if the weight of tension has been lifted and released from your body you sense that you are feeling lighter now almost as if you are floating and gravity has let go of its effects on you [Music] this lightness comes from letting go of anything and everything weighing on you both physically and emotionally it has been lifted completely out of your body [Music] this release allows you to feel lighter physically and you drift into a more productive sleep to prepare you for the day ahead [Music] let go of tension [Music] let go of pain let go of negativity and make room for the rejuvenation of a deep night's sleep let this come to you easily and effortlessly in your mind here these positive affirmations as your own beliefs hear them as truth in this present moment let these statements move you towards a spiritual surrender allow these ideas to help you drift into a deep healing state you don't have to do anything simply listen and allow sleep to come easily to you eventually my voice will fade away and you will drift off into a deep healing state of sleep for many hours I am ready to release the past and move forward now [Music] I am ready to surrender and move forward now [Music] I surrender I allow I accept I surrender by giving up attachments to results

0 Just as you take food into your body, consuming both healthy and not-so-healthy options, you also consume media throughout the day.  You listen to music, watch TV, read the news, and so on.  Although these may provide knowledge and entertainment, they can also create anxiety and stress in our minds and bodies or take us away from our connection to the mind.  This exercise offers a few different ways to bring mindfulness to these moments of consumption.  They don’t necessarily need to be done step-by-step.  First, consider what the impact may be of what you are choosing to consume.  Are you reading the news to inform yourself, or to fuel frustration?  Perhaps the television show you watch has quite a bit of violence and gets your nervous system going.  This isn’t to label a show, story, or song as good or bad.  It’s merely about recognizing the effects of your choice.  As you consume the piece of media, notice the response of the mind and body.  If you are watching TV, mute the volume during commercials to check in with yourself.
0 Please find a sitting position that allows you to be alert, your spine erect but not rigid, and also relaxed.  Now close your eyes and rest your hands in an easy effortless way.  Take a few moments to scan through your body, and wherever possible, soften and release obvious areas of physical tension.  We begin the practice of coming back by establishing our home base.  While there are many possible anchors such as sound or sensations throughout the body, the most common and the one we’ll be exploring here is the breath.  Please breathe naturally and simply notice where the breath is easiest to detect and where the breath also feels pleasant or at least neutral.  So you might be paying attention to how the breath feels as it flows in and out of your nose, you might feel the touch of your breath around your nostrils or on your upper lip, or perhaps you feel the movement of your chest or the rising and falling of your abdomen, or perhaps you feel your whole body like a balloon expanding with the in breath, deflating with the out breath.  So just take some moments to bring your attention to the sensations of breathing in one of these areas, a relaxed attentiveness.  There’s no need to control the breath.  Rather, sense you’re receiving the breath much like you’d listen to sound.  With a relaxed awareness, discover what the breath is really like as a changing experience of sensations.

0 [Narrator] Hey there, I'm John, and welcome to our meditation. If you're having a hard time right now, it's okay, you are not alone and there is help. You can reach out to a loved one, a friend, a colleague or medical resources. If you're suffering from severe depression or having harmful thoughts, please reach out to your local suicide prevention resources. Links are in the description of this video. Go ahead and settle into a position you can comfortably hold for a while. Be gentle with yourself and honor what your body wants. And if you can, try to avoid a position you'd fall asleep in. Noticing your connection to your feet on the floor or your legs on the chair. Allow these to ground you down to the floor where it's still and solid. Place one hand on your heart and one hand on your lower belly. Close your eyes or let them gaze downward towards the floor gently. And inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, into your lower belly. And feeling the hand on your belly move outward as it fills with air. Mother hand on your chest remains gentle and still. Now slowly exhale all of the air out of your body as if you were blowing out candles on a cake. Feeling your belly contract back in. And again breathing deeply into your lower belly, feeling that inhale weaving in and out of your muscles and yourselves, nourishing your body, beginning to allow you to feel lighter, clearer, more still. And as you exhale, allow the breath to gently begin to carry away any sadness and depression or heaviness that you may be feeling. (uplifting music) Continue breathing slowly and deeply into your lower belly. Allowing your focus to remain on the rhythm of your breathing and the sensation of the expansion and contraction of your belly. And if you get distracted that's okay. Just return your attention back to your breath. Using it as your anchor for the rest of our time together, your inhales nourish and lighten you, and they steal you enough to see through the cloudiness and your exhales gently carry the heaviness, pain and negativity away which opens up space for ease and gratitude to come in. (uplifting music) Take some time now to sit with a lot of compassion and love for yourself. Depression can feel overwhelming and takes so much of our energy, but here and now, from this more still grounded space, you can give yourself all of the compassion you deserve and all of the love too. See if you can allow yourself to just be exactly where you are. And when judgment comes up, breathe into it with love and compassion. And let it gently float away, dissipating as it does. And see if you can let yourself become aware of a new feeling of stillness and ease of self love and of hope. (uplifting music) Remember in those times when the heaviness and cloudiness set in, you always have the capacity to return to this space to take care of yourself and love yourself exactly as you are, to wrap yourself in a big hug. There is hope, this will pass and you are not alone. (uplifting music ) Now let's take three more deep breaths together. Take a deep inhale in, holding it for a bit and exhaling it out. Again, an even deeper breath than the one before feeling it weave in and out of your muscles and yourselves. And exhale it out. The last time, your deepest breath yet, this time sending that oxygen through your entire body and when it reaches the top of your head and you're ready, you can open your eyes. (uplifting music)

0 Hello my loves welcome to a guided meditation for self love by Lavendaire I’m happy you made the choice to meditate today and give back to yourself. Let’s get into a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes. Rest your hands on your lap and face your palms up for receiving. Take three deep breaths with an open mouth exhale. Breathe deep into your lungs and your diaphragm, expand…. And then open mouth exhale and let it all out. Repeat two more times… take a deep breath into your belly, and open mouth exhale, and let it all out. Deep breath in….And exhale, let it all out. Take this moment to feel your body and focus on gratitude. What are you grateful for, right now? Feel the energy in your body, a body that works to keep you alive and functioning, without a second thought. A body that supports you and everything you want to do in life. Give this body acknowledgement and love, for all the miraculous things it does for you to keep you here, breathing. Now, focus on your breath for a moment. Isn’t it a wonder that your body knows how to breathe, continuously, without much effort or awareness? But once you shift your awareness to your breath, you become in control of the flow of your breath? Your awareness is powerful. Wherever your attention goes, energy flows. Use the power of your awareness to focus on your body, feeling your presence with each breath. Relax your eyebrows… Relax your brain… relax your shoulders... relax your heart… Relax your entire body.... Feel your body soften and relax. Know that you are safe in this moment. Your body is your shell and your home for this lifetime. Take good care of it. Give it love. Consider: What does self love mean to you? Self love is… accepting yourself, quirks and flaws included. Forgiving yourself, knowing it’s okay to make mistakes. Knowing your worth, standing tall and not feeling small or inferior to others. Loving yourself and your journey, knowing that you are both a work of art and a work in progress at the same time. And all of it is OKAY. Cultivating self love is learning to practice unconditional love for yourself… What does unconditional love mean? How does it feel to love yourself, unconditionally? No conditions.. Meaning: You don’t have to be anything other than yourself. You don’t have to prove yourself to anyone. You are already lovable and loved. You don’t have to try… You are already worthy of love. Feel how it would feel to love yourself, unconditionally… Now we’ll be reciting some positive affirmations to cultivate more self love. Feel free to repeat after me, in your mind. I accept myself exactly as I am. I love and embrace all of me. I am grateful for my body, and all that it’s doing to support me. All of me is beautiful. I am enough. I am worthy. I am a light in this world. My light is unique and incomparable to others. I respect myself and give myself what I need. Setting boundaries is an act of self love. I release all that is holding me back. I release all that does not align with my truest self. I am authentic to who I am and aligned with what I want. I choose love over fear. Come back to your breath. Feel the energy in your body… notice how you feel now, nourishing yourself with love. Remember this feeling, you can always come back to this. Now, we will use the power of visualization. Imagine the energy of love, surrounding you, surrounding your entire body. Feel the warmth of this loving energy envelop and hug your entire body. Love is all around you. Light is all around you. Breathe in… inviting that energy of love & light into you, through the crown of your head. Visualize that energy flow through you, down your entire body, nourishing yourself with unconditional love and light. As you breathe out, release all the negativity and fear that has held you back from pure unconditional love for yourself. Breathe in love… energy in through the top of your head, and breathe out.. Let that beautiful energy flow through you, pushing out all that doesn’t serve you anymore. Where light enters, darkness cannot stay. Continue this visualization as you gently breathe in… and out… breathing in love, and breathing out fear… Resetting and replenishing your energetic body with love and light. Begin to come back to your breath. Check in with your body, and your energy, and notice how you are feeling. You have given yourself so much love today. Continue this practice by nourishing yourself with love and acceptance, every single day. You are fully deserving of love, no matter what. You are already worthy, simply by existing. I hope you take this energy of self love into the rest of your day. The more love you have for yourself, the more love you will put out into the world. And thus, a better, more beautiful world we will create together. Sending you love & light, Namaste.
0 Let's begin by taking a moment to settle your body into a comfortable position (2 seconds).  You may close your eyes or keep them slightly open with a soft focus looking downward a few feet in front of you (2 seconds).  Allow your spine to lift and your shoulders to soften (2 seconds).  Today we will practice a body scan (2 seconds).  Taking a full breath in (2 seconds) and a long slow breath out (2 seconds).  Bring gentle awareness to the breathing (2 seconds).  Notice the in breath (2 seconds)  and out breath (2 seconds)  and spaces in between (10 seconds).  Bring attention to the top of your head, notice sensations or lack of sensations (2 seconds).   Move your attention down to the back of your head, the sides (2 seconds),  to your forehead (2 seconds), and face (5 seconds).  Move your attention to your neck (2 seconds), and your throat (2 seconds), and now shoulders.  Noticing what sensations you are aware of. Shift attention to your arms, upper arms, lower arms (2 seconds),  your hands (2 seconds), and fingers (2 seconds).  Bring your attention to your back, upper back (2 seconds),   down to the middle (2 seconds), and down farther to your lower back (10 seconds).
0 The body is always breathing, and the breath is constantly moving.  Your breath is not only the best place to start; it’s a constant you can return to anytime you need a little centering.  In this practice, you will gently find the breath in the body.  There is nothing to figure out, there are no problems to solve, and there’s nothing special you need to do.  Constantly return to your direct experience of the body breathing.  You are training the mind to be with one experience without distraction.  Find a comfortable position for the body.  Sitting is often recommended, as it helps keep the body awake and energized.  You can also try lying flat on your back, or standing.  You may sit on a yoga mat, meditation cushion, or chair.  Find what feels comfortable and sustainable for a few minutes of stillness.  Gently allow the eyes to close.  If you’re more comfortable with the eyes open, try softly gazing at the floor or ceiling (depending on your position).  Allow the eyes to relax and rest on one spot.  The idea is to minimize distractions in your practice.  Bring your awareness to the abdomen.  Relaxing the muscles there, see if you can feel the natural rising and falling.  Imagine the body is breathing itself.  From the navel around to the obliques, notice the movement with each breath.

0 No matter how much you try to think positive thoughts and be optimistic about the future, unpleasant thoughts will still arise.  You cannot avoid them, and there is no use in pretending they aren’t present.  Your mindfulness practice can help you approach these thoughts with curiosity.  As you build an understanding of your unpleasant thinking patterns, they will no longer hook you in so strongly.  You can learn to allow them to be present without letting them consume you.  This exercise is a practice in letting thoughts go so that you are better able to do it when negative thoughts arise.  Close the eyes and tune in to the points of contact in the body.  Feel yourself grounded and stable as you sit.  Breathe deeply, feeling the body supported by the chair or cushion.  Pay attention to the experience in your mind.  Notice any thoughts as they arise, and try to identify any emotions that go with them.
0 So, to reduce anxiety, start by taking a moment to relax your body, soften any unnecessary tension in your belly and shoulder, and find a posture that feels both relaxed and alert,  Rest your hands in an easy effortless way.  With your eyes open, take a few moments to scan your awareness through the sensations of your body, and wherever possible, soften and release obvious areas of physical tension.  Let your eyes stay open and focus on the middle of the room wherever you are.  And then see how you can let your awareness travel across the room from where you’re sitting.  If you’re lying down, you can let your attention go upwards to the ceiling.  And then notice how you can let your attention come back to the center of the room.  And see if you can bring your attention closer, to about book-reading distance as if you’re reading a book in your hands.  So clearly, you can determine where your attention goes.  And now you can let your eyes close and just let your attention go inward.  And gently focus on the sensations of the breath moving in and out of the body...  And you can let your attention go to wherever the breath comes most naturally to you.  For some people, it’s the sensations of the air in the nostrils , with that gentle feeling coming in and out as the air passes in and out at the nostrils.

climb [Music] the stone is smooth and cold to your touch continue to climb slowly there are many steps spiralling up ahead of you we're not afraid of the height it feels wonderful to be leaving all of your problems below as you walk cast a glance down at the small room below see many boxes large and small all of them filled to overflowing with your problems your anxieties and all of your regrets feel a sense of relief as you climb higher moving away from all the chaos the clutter and anxieties below with each step you move towards peace and inner contentment you are now approaching the top step and an inky blackness greets you as you emerge onto a circular Ward platform you note that the sky forms the roof and there are millions of stars twinkling in the black expanse there is a sudden rush of freedom feel the sense of wonder and horror as you look towards the Hamill's [Music] in the middle of the pure-white curved platform there is a circular flat seat sloping back into a contoured chair made out of the same marble as its surroundings sit and feel the coolness of the marble beneath you it is a perfect seat for reflection and you lean back feeling the stone supporting your back in the most perfect places it's as if it was carved with you in mind imagine that you are now looking up at the night sky there are no clouds to mask the Stars and they provide you with a vastness that is appealing a way to escape the tensions of everyday life in real life you may feel tense frustrated and even trapped by life's confinements but as you look up now into the depths of this extraordinary sky dotted with stars millions of stars light-years away you feel a sense of desire to float up high and to become one with the universe to feel weightless to gain a new and inspiring sense of perspective feel yourself begin to float gently out of the marble seat you move up even higher twisting your position around so that you can look around as you float higher you float up above the marble walls and now you can see the view of the city around you lights the twinkle far beneath the expanse of sky the view is magnificent you can see for miles the landscape lit by twinkling lights heralding the existence of those who live and share this reality with you a cityscape that comes to life with the sprinkling of artificial lights that mirror the heavens above you move effortlessly relishing in this feeling of freedom here you are cast afloat from the problems of daily life it is like flying but with no effort required a single thought enables you to change direction at will and you travel on you look down moonlight is reflected in the rippling waters of the estuary gentle waves lap at the shore and as you float out further high above the darkened waters boats Bob along the harbour walls and the feeling here is of complete peace and tranquility you feel invisible there is no blame here no regrets just or at being able to see life from a whole new perspective traveling over the estuary you head along the coastline scaling large cliffs flying high above them thin wispy clouds almost transparent from below are blown in from the sea hugging the cliffs as you move higher the clouds wrap themselves around you like gossamer threads the clouds wispy fragile and translucent follow in your trail as you saw ever higher rising vertically now higher and higher looking up towards the moon silvery gray the moon is for you marvel at its beauty and power knowing how it controls the ebb and wane of the tides he is suddenly life seems less complicated there is a sense of pureness of mystery and yet clarity life is good life is wonderful and you share a sense of connection with the universe breathing deeply and then release the breath letting go of any tension within your body instead focus on the softness of every muscle feel yourself loose relaxed and free from burden far below you low flying birds hug the surface of the water disturbed they seem tiny and fast moving the water ripples gently sparkling stars and the light from the moon Herald your way you see the world from an enlightened viewpoint and it is one of wonder here high above the fragmented clouds you feel a part of the world's mystery connected on every level and free from your problems you can sense a change around you gradually the air becomes warmer and misted as cloud formations begin to forge together the sky changes color dark muted through to light and for a while the Sun and Moon share a place in the heavens he dropped down now through the fluffy clouds thicker now and float down towards the Earth's surface you feel exalted as the see now mirrors the changing skies sparkling sunlight glinting across the surface and shimmers of blue you drift down moving on away from the water's edges still high above the city's architecture tall concrete pillars and homes reaching up towards the sky and small private residences alone surrounded by small patches of green like a complex jigsaw of life stone and irregular shapes all fitting together in an almost seamless ease marvel at how the man-made structures can look beautiful too here you can see that life is about living and not holding on to problems there is no place in your life anymore for anxieties that make you feel ill tension headaches regrets that nor away that cue or the decisions that you just can't make here in this weightless existence you realize that you can be free from all of the negative aspects of life no longer shackled by an existence that holds you back this acknowledgement is meaningful it has the power to change your life as you breathing deeply conjure up the image of those problems and all of the boxes that you left behind initially they were overflowing threatening in their power to hamper your life to impact you at every turn now picture them reduced in size no more threatening just minor inconveniences now that you have scaled them in your mind shrink the problems smaller still breathe deeply again and then out breathing out the last of your connections to those problems and visualize them growing ever smaller minut a fraction of their former size and you realize that your perspective was clouded before your judgement of center your realization of the truth in life and the importance of nature and your place in the world makes those problems seem insignificant by comparison [Music] focus again on your breathing inhaling as you open up the chest exhaling as you breathe out it is time to see the problems of life as mere obstacles it is time to look to the important things in life and to step away from any doubts regrets or anxieties that affect you negatively it is time to feel contentment and to embrace pure inner peace drift gently now down to earth close your eyes and feel your descent you are at peace with life and with yourself finally you understand your part within the universe drifting down bathed in golden light as the Sun shimmers in the early morning sky the faint warmth is comforting a beautiful start to the day it is time to feel positive about your life you have the power to do so you are centered you retain the feeling of peace and wonder you are now back in your own reality imagine that you are back in your bed comfortable safe and secure open your eyes and stretch out your muscles breathing deeply to send oxygen around your body realize how good you feel right now keep experiencing the wonderful sense of calmness and deep peace as you remember your wonderful high time above the clouds a part of the midnight sky and then a part of the early morning transition as night became day understand now that your problems are such a small part of time and space and even within your own reality understand that your problems can be dealt with quickly and clearly with clarity of mind breathing deeply and keep your sense of peace and tranquility breathe out slowly noting that no tension remains remember that you can return to this meditation whenever you need a renewed perspective you are one with the universe [Music]
0 welcome to a guided meditation for anxiety and depression on the clutter of the mind so let's start the practice by finding our seat you can sit on a chair or cushion on the floor [Music] and sit with your back upright but comfortable so before getting into the practice let's just start by acknowledging how we feel in this moment and we don't need to add a story to the way we are feeling we don't need to judge it or try to change it right now just be with it part of suffering is that we suffer that we suffer so we add thoughts or stories that only worsen what we're feeling mindfulness is an open awareness and acceptance of what we're experiencing in the moment whether it's good or bad so let's start here with acknowledgement and now let's start by taking in a few big deep breaths breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth and now close your eyes let's place our attention now on the breath start by noticing each inhale and exhale the sensations around each breath and where you notice the most maybe you notice the rising sensations in the chest or stomach maybe you notice the falling sensations around the body on each exhale and just be with the sensations follow the rhythm of each in breath and out breath with your full attention and as we do this thoughts may arise feelings may surface and this is part of the practice if you are experiencing anxiety and a bout of depression right now there will likely be thoughts and feelings that attempt to pull your attention away and when this happens notice it instead of resisting or changing it see if you can actually play with these thoughts and feelings here see if you can become welcoming of them and allow them to come and go before returning to watching the breath and if you find yourself following a thought or feeling with more thoughts or adding a story to them gently pull your attention back to the breath watching the sensations of breathing and as you watch the breath and continue to notice thoughts see if you can use the out breath to release any discomfort to release any unwelcome thoughts sending them out with the exhale so for the just that moment even if it's very brief the mind is empty and allow any feelings that come up to be acknowledged and sent out with the breath as well so that even for a brief moment you are emotionally still and quiet see if you can find those moments where just for a brief micro second you are without any anxiety or feelings of depression and when you get a glimpse of it it's tempting to seek it but we're not fabricating anything here or seeking it just allow these moments to come to you through mindfulness through watching the breath and resting in awareness and now let's shift our attention from the breath into the physical notice the contact that your body is making your feet on the floor your body against the chair your hands in the lap and notice your weight on the chair or on the floor as well and just be with the physical sensations for the next few moments and now in the final few moments of the practice just let go allow the mind to do what it wants and go where it wants and now open your eyes thanks for having the courage and will today to do this mindfulness practice and i'll see you next time
0 today I will guide you on a journey of relaxation clear your overthinking mind clear the clutter of your mind to relax and calm you down naturally you have the state of peace within you that can be accessed anytime you'll find the more you practice the easier it will be to come back to the state anytime you need and you will see the benefits trickle over into many other areas of your life hello and welcome I'm Sara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are in Oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing enjoy the journey and now I invite you to make yourself comfortable turn off or tune out all distractions and commit to this time for yourself let go of your to-do lists and your responsibilities taking this time for you for self-care is a gift to enjoy you must first help yourself and love yourself before you can help or love anyone else when you feel ready close your eyes and bring your full awareness to your breath begin to count the length of your breath in then as you breathe out encourage your exhale to be one count longer than your inhale allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress or tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow and your body will calm down do this for a few breaths cycles at your own pace allowing each slow exhale to settle you into relaxation and stillness for this practice  now as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up as you breathe out this white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of stress  take a long slow deep breath in through your nose and now move your breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to just surrender as you exhale breathing out anything that no longer serves you each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even more deeply  now allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm know that your breath is an anchor or a reminder to be in the present moment know that you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment so you know you are always in the present moment when you are attentive to your breath your breath is a reminder to slow down and be present and this reminder is always with you  as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer notice your thoughts and you might acknowledge them by saying in your mind thinking by acknowledging the act of thinking you can let it go when your mind does wander simply come back to your breath and use this breath as an anchor or a reminder  you'll keep coming back any time your mind wanders as many times as you need [Music] as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and slow down  allow your body to soften and your breath to be calm know that your body responds to your thoughts so you can think about relaxing and ask your body for a release of tension your mind is so powerful and creating change in all aspects of your life and now invite your body to relax each muscle completely begin with the muscles around your eyes and your jaw by relaxing these muscles specifically the rest of your body knows exactly what to do and will relax in response continue to unclench your jaw completely and soften the muscles in and around your eyes as you begin to feel the familiar heaviness throughout your entire body all you have to do is think about relaxing and releasing the tension in your body and your body will respond because it listens to what your mind tells it  and now feel your entire body let go feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside know that your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you you are in complete control but for now your mind and body know it is time to relax and let go it is time to slow down right now all the sounds around you are unimportant and they simply add to your relaxation [Music] all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow your body to relax and your subconscious mind will do the job of clearing the clutter notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper you now allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go letting your body mind and spirit become one continuing to enjoy a peaceful and tranquil state begin to use your imagination and in your mind see yourself in front of a beautifully decorated glass elevator door this glass door is etched and frosted with the most amazing design on it in your mind you can see the beauty in this design  you can reach out and feel the texture with your fingers feel the cool temperature of the glass this elevator will take you down to the deepest part of your subconscious mind so that you can declutter your thoughts release tension and negativity and this will allow you to develop positive thoughts and a calm state of mind in your mind you see the door to this elevator opening and you step in to experience its spaciousness you know you are completely safe and you can see through the glass walls of the elevator you push the B button so that you can go down to the basement of your mind this elevator will lead you deep into relaxation each level will take you deeper down and in a moment as I count the elevator will take you down slowly into a more deeply relaxed state you will find that the deeper down you go the more comfortable and calm you will become the more easily connected to your deepest subconscious level you will become and now on the count of ten as the elevator begins its slow descent you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do 8 you know you are right where you need to be on your journey and you allow the outside world to just turn off 7 each level down takes you even deeper into a relaxed state 6 you feel yourself going deeper into relaxation deeper into a connection with yourself five you are halfway down letting go completely for going deeper and deeper into comfort  three almost to the basement of your subconscious mind to experiencing deep deep tranquility and one all the way down into the deep state of relaxation and peace and now you have reached the bottom the elevator doors slowly open and you walk out into the basement of your subconscious mind you take a look around and see that you have stepped out into what looks like a library you see that this space stores all of your memories as well as the possibilities for your future there are rows and rows of shelves throughout the entire room each shelf filled with many many books  as you look around you see books of all different sizes and colors take a moment to look around see the deepest part of your subconscious mind and what is stored here  you might notice some of the books are disorganized and there are areas of clutter around the floor in front of some of the shelves and as you see this you feel an intense desire to organize the books so that they are easily accessed when needed you feel a desire to clean up the clutter around the room and you know that by doing this you will organize and declutter your mind and your life  you realize that just by thinking about organizing and cleaning magically this room changes you recognize how powerful and brilliant your mind is the room automatically becomes well-organized and the clutter is cleared this change has simplified your life and with this change you feel a positive transformation within yourself you know that deep inside you a switch has been reset so that everything works in your favor you are now organized and decluttered in all areas of your life as well as your thinking mind you are easily able to generate support and inspiration for yourself  you enrich yourself mentally emotionally and spiritually you easily do all that it takes to actualize your goals to thrive and to live in alignment with your values and intentions from today forward you begin to take even better care of yourself you redefine yourself as a happy energetic light hearted person you feel like a physical weight has been lifted to allow you to be lighter and calmer you allow new and more empowered thoughts and inspired feelings of success healing and wellness to profoundly build within you you respect yourself showing yourself love kindness and compassion take a moment to let those positive qualities sink in  and now you let go of any negative thoughts that no longer serve you you let go of old outdated beliefs that may have helped you in the past but are now holding you back keeping you stuck you let go of any past negativities and you replace them with positive behaviors positive thoughts and feelings of gratitude you are aware of your thoughts and you have the ability to change from a negative thought to a positive one just by being aware you believe without a doubt that you are strong and confident in your life you see your past limiting beliefs and behaviors disappear to be gone for good [Music] self-doubt fear and anxiety are things of the past that cannot will not ever affect you again you replace these feelings with optimism confidence and an easily calm disposition you trust your instincts and your abilities you are easily able to accept things as they are knowing you are exactly where you are supposed to be on your journey take a moment longer to feel these positive words and beliefs as truth as they sink in to your mind  and now bringing your attention to the imagined room around you take one last look around at the organized and decluttered space of your subconscious mind know that this new organized space will translate to stress free anxiety free living in all aspects of your life  now in your mind begin to walk back towards the elevator see the doors slowly open and invite you in as you step into the elevator you have a strong sense that you can continue to experience this calm relaxed state in your life by continuing the process of simplifying and clearing the clutter you know you are capable of achieving your dreams and that you have the potential to accomplish great things you can feel this powerful transformation happening in your mind and

0 when it feels like everything is out of your control seek to connect with what you do have control over your breath and your response to your experience in times of uncertainty anxiety worry and fear are often heightened these strong emotions are a signal a reminder for you to deepen your connection with yourself you can choose to see these uncertain times as an opportunity to slow down practice inner reflection and look for the positive growth that will come out of the challenges that we are all collectively facing while it feels as though we are each going through this in isolation you are not alone even this meditation others all over the world are practicing with you and supporting you on your journey as you are doing for them as well and I am here to support you as I am writing and recording this meditation I am thinking of each and every one of you and sending you positive healing energy if you are new here I'm Sarah Raymond and if you are returning welcome back here at the mindful movement we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing today let go of fear and worry know that you are safe and you can choose to cultivate more peace and joy I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes if you'd like or simply soften your gaze invite your attention to shift away from the sights smells and sounds around you and begin to bring your focus inward while it may feel like you want to escape reality when things get difficult now is your invitation to make a deeper connection with yourself and with the collective energy of the world become aware of where your body makes contact with the surface below you let this connection ground you feel this as support and allow yourself to be fully supported you are safe you can trust in the universe  use this sensation of where you and your support meet to draw your awareness gradually from your outer experience to your inner world  notice without judgment what your physical sensations are in this moment your body has the amazing ability to cope with challenges and grow stronger from them if you allow and let go of resistance it is okay to befriend the fear that shows up for you fear is not the enemy it is a helpful and necessary emotion when it is channeled correctly meet whatever you're experiencing with love  allow your relaxed awareness now to move to the sensations of your hands notice your hands as they are in this moment what sensations are they are now do you sense tingling or buzzing  are you aware of the temperature of your hands  now make tight fists with both hands clenching and gripping tightly take a deep breath in hold it for a moment and as you exhale as slowly as you can release your hands completely letting go letting go letting go do this again make a tight fist with both hands hold it tight take a deep breath in hold for a moment and again exhale as slowly as you can and release your hands release the gripping letting go throughout your entire body feel how this relaxation moves throughout your entire body as you let go of the gripping in your hands  take a moment to enjoy this ease connect with this relaxed state  while there are many things in life that you don't have control over your breath is one aspect that you can direct a bit to continue relaxing and letting go even deeper invite your exhales to lengthen now if it feels right to you start to count the length of your next inhale and encourage your exhale to be twice as long perhaps you begin with a two count inhale and a four count exhale and as you continue lengthening each exhale and counting your breath you may move to a three and six count follow the lead of your breath breathing in this way for a few more cycles allow your breath to be easy and relaxing continuing to let go of gripping and let go of the need to try too hard  consider the times in life when releasing and letting go gives way to growth trees must let go of leaves in the fall to have the opportunity for new growth in the spring waves in the ocean flow in to the shore and back out again creating a natural ebb and flow [Music] many animals must shed their skin or outer layer in order to grow  as humans we have a period of exhalation to make room for the next inhalation there must be an in period as well as an out period receiving and letting go consider the times when resistance creates more difficulty  for example the spinning wheels of a car in mud the more you try to get out the deeper the wheels dig into the mud  take a moment now to scan through your body can you find any areas where you are holding on breathe into those areas and then let go [Music] perhaps you may be holding on at the area of your stomach can you let go here can you open the flow of energy within you continue to connect with relaxation as deeply as you can practice surrendering practice letting go open to the healing energy within you continue this on your own for the next few moments in silence and I will check back with you soon  when your mind wanders come back to your body come back to your powerful healing energy are you able to relax even more connect even deeper with yourself [Music] listen to your heart surrender to your inner wisdom again become aware of the place where your body meets the support below you sense this connection since the support in times of challenge and uncertainty we can support one another the benefit of your meditation practice and your connection to your inner wisdom will benefit your loved ones neighbors community and the collective energy of the universe we are all in this together and will grow stronger from this time as it draws us closer to one another look through the dark night to see the light trust in the universe  feel the love surrounding you have faith that this will pass take a deep breath in once more and let it out slowly release peace and healing energy out into the

relax do your best to let go of any expectations of what you think you might sense and simply feel what is there without judgement as you continue to notice the sensations around your head face throat and neck try to connect directly to what you are feeling rather than using your eyes to scan the body the eyes can create tension internally try to sense the feelings from within your body do you feel tingling heat tightness tension or relaxation you might feel a sensation of floating lightness or heaviness you may sense that there is no difference between where you end and where the energy around you begins it is all connected it is all one whatever you're feeling is okay simply observe the sensations as they are and invite in a sense of ease in your body you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part allows it to relax and let go continue moving the scan of your body downward all the way to your feet and stay with the sensations and the relaxation process as you slowly scan your body fully notice any areas that might still be holding on to any lingering tension and ask your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe and supported and knows what to do to relax your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you or needs your immediate attention all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow yourself to relax experience and embrace the feelings of unconditional love for yourself being fully present to this moment to your physical body to the sounds around you and the surface below you set the intention for peace and relaxation for your physical body for you mentally and spiritually your mind may naturally drift off into thoughts and that is okay you do not need to completely shut off your mind and empty it of all thoughts when you do recognize that your mind is drifting acknowledge your thoughts without following those thoughts into a drawn-out story you can choose to visualize the thoughts drifting off into the distance like a cloud floating by and then come back to your breath to ground you and bring you into the present moment once more the breath is your place to be fully present the breath gives you the opportunity to pause if your attention shifts to focus on a sensation or emotion allow it to move away from your breath for a moment to notice what's coming up in your physical body again without judgment and without getting caught up in thinking stories intend to allow the sensations or emotions as they are if your attention begins to drift simply come back to your breath as your anchor to ground you in this present moment and now begin to bring your awareness back to this present moment back to the surface below you and when you are ready take a deep breath and then sigh it out breathe out any remaining stress frustration tension and distraction from within you don't be afraid to make a sound take another deep breath and allow your exhale to flow out of you cleansing and healing your body and mind like a warm wave of energy do this again and notice how you become increasingly more relaxed yet energized and focused at the same time feel yourself becoming present anchored and grounded in the simple practice of breathing deeply and when you are ready open your eyes knowing you are calm and focused to go on with your day
0 now I invite you to find comfort  choose a position either seated or lying down with your spine straight begin by closing your eyes to heighten your awareness of this present moment through the senses other than sight  explore and connect with the space around you using your senses  allow yourself to settle in to this space noticing how you relate to the room around you  notice the air in the room since the temperature of the air as it gently contacts your skin does the air around you feel humid or dry is there a distinct smell in the room and now listen for any sounds within this room  perhaps you hear the word of a fan or air conditioning unit  sounds are vibrations and can sometimes be felt within your body look inward and feel the sounds and growing your field of consciousness now to look for any distant sounds you may be able to hear without straining listen to the sound that is the farthest that you can hear  letting your awareness shift inward to your body now  and how it interacts with your surroundings  notice the feel of the fabric of your clothes on your body  since the constant pull of gravity anchoring you into the surface beneath you now allow your relaxed awareness to rest on your breath without manipulation without judgment be the observer of your natural automatic breath be here now as an observer and witness as your body is being breathed there is no right or wrong no good or bad you are exactly where you need to be this body  this moment this breath nothing has ever happened in the past and nothing will ever happen in the future life always takes place in this present moment our lives are a series of present moment experiences what is there for you in the experience of this moment lean into this moment say yes to this moment with your breath allow it to be the perfect moment that it is  slowly allow your breath to deepen inviting your spine to lengthen as you inhale without effort or force guide your breath to be deep in both location and volume  listen to the sound your inhale makes  inhale with an intention an intention to fully accept this moment as it arrives when we want the moment to be different than it is we create an internal conflict a fight with reality when we accept the moment for what it is we can add peace and ease to our moments knowing wholeheartedly they are as they should be  we are on our journey always at the right place always at the right time  now let your breath soften to a natural rhythm continuing to inhale with this intention of presence and as you exhale allow yourself to let go let go of areas of tension in your body perhaps around your eyes and jaw  softening your neck and shoulders let go of negativity from the past let go of the worry of what's to come to be here in this present moment give yourself permission to let go of the to-do lists the shoulds and the students allow yourself to rest your awareness on the right now this inhale this exhale  this gift of breath you have right now for the next few moments of silence I invite you to continue to practice being with your breath as the observer  watch the path of each inhale and exhale listen and feel your breath fully as it shows up for you right now  observe yourself experiencing this present moment  allow your breath to slowly deepen again invite your awareness back to the surface noticing the sounds in the room again perhaps since any difference of how you feel now from when you began this meditation and when you are ready makes some very small movements with your body maybe rubbing your thumb and finger together or perhaps wiggling your toes and begin to let a little light into your eyes and now take one more deep breath opening your eyes and smiling in gratitude for taking this time for yourself thank you for practicing with me today
0 first let me offer my sincere congratulations to you for taking this important first step in your meditation practice the fact that you are hearing this recording means you have decided to make time for yourself to turn the lens of your vision inward when we are more often looking outward frequently not knowing the right way to meditate or the possibility of not doing it perfectly may be discouraging when beginning a practice in reality meditation is not a destination it is a journey it is not about the outcome it is about the process about the curiosity you bring to what is there for you right now there is no wrong way to do it this is why we refer to it as a meditation practice not a meditation perfect for today's practice we will follow three stages and if you decide to continue to practice on your own you can follow these stages or come back to this recording as a guide as frequently as you like you can follow these three stages for five minutes or an hour or any time you decide simply show up with a positive and open mind and now let's begin I invite you to find a posture that allows you to be alert and awake yet still unrelaxed perhaps close your eyes or soften your gaze on a fixed point and let the background blur [Music] without expectations of what you think you will find observe your breath in its natural state without changing or judging the first stage of today's meditation is to focus on one thing and that will be your breath [Music] the next stage is to focus on nothing in particular with the intention to go back to the first stage of focus if you find your mind wandering and the third stage is to let go into blissful peace and simply be these stages do not need to be linear and you can move from one to the other and back again sometimes practicing will be comfortable and come easily and other times it may be difficult and uncomfortable emotions can arise your meditation practice parallels life in this way the practice is about the journey not the destination begin to notice any sensations you experience on each inhale [Music] maybe you feel the air passed through your nostrils can you sense the path your breath travels once inside your body [Music] [Music] what subtle changes do you experience with each breath in notice your chest and back rise and expand with each inhale do you feel invigorated with each inhale and now what do you notice about your natural exhale do you sense a softening as your breath is expelled what does your breath sound like perhaps you feel that the air is slightly warmer with your exhale than it is on your inhale notice your chest and back sink and soften with each exhale notice your own natural pattern as it comes and goes do you feel a subtle relaxation as you exhale each time [Music] and now for the next few breaths since the natural pause between each part of your breath there is a moment after you inhale and before you begin your next exhale where you can bring your attention to rest [Music] continuing to focus on your breath a little longer begin to create an equal part breath starting to count the length of your inhale and match the length with your exhale you may find that as you practice this equal part breath the lengths and depth of your breath extends whatever you notice is okay perhaps explore what it would be like to start your inhale from low in your belly then fill up your ribs and chest then all the way up to your throat and then exhale fully for the same length as your inhale practice this equal count breath for several more cycles until your focus naturally releases the counting to focus on nothing in particular then you will practice being in quiet stillness if your mind wanders off into thought or story or you notice a noise or distraction simply bring your attention back to your counting and the equal part breath until you are ready once more to focus on nothing specific and let go into bliss enjoy this practice for a few moments longer and I will bring your attention back when it's time this is a practice it is natural to lose focus so be kind to yourself and keep coming back continue to start over when you need without judging it is time now to begin the journey to looking outward once more take your time deepen your breath again bring some gentle movements to your fingers and toes and welcome in refreshing energy throughout your body as your field of consciousness grows out from your Center bring some light and color into your eyes from your surroundings at first notice this space where part of you is still looking inward as another part of you is beginning to look outward again how long can this experience last throughout your day are you able to metaphorically continue to have one eye looking inward as the other is looking outward thank you for practicing with me today remember meditation like learning any other skill takes practice perseverance and patience keep showing up keep practicing

way that you live you are strengthening the connection between your body and your mind today you will build the skill of mindfulness and living in the present moment [Music] now without making any changes to your breath simply notice how it flows in through your nose and fills up your body with life [Music] follow the flow of the air as it goes into your body through your nostrils [Music] and notice how your chest and abdomen rise and fall naturally as the breath comes in and goes out [Music] this breath will be your anchor and keep you rooted in the present moment during this practice and beyond [Music] when you focus on your breath you are always focused in the present moment you cannot get back a past breath and you cannot breathe in a future breath before the present moment [Music] as you continue to stay with your breath as an anchor to the present moment allow it to flow naturally [Music] releasing any physical and emotional tension with each exhale [Music] and now begin to deepen each breath in and out [Music] as your breath fills you up more fully [Music] invite your attention to rest on the space that comes between the inhale and the exhale [Music] and as you focus your attention on this stillness allow it to last a little longer pausing holding the breath momentarily between the inhale and the exhale [Music] breathe in this way for three more cycles of breath attending to the stillness the pause [Music] and feel as the tension melts away from your body [Music] give yourself permission to be fully supported by your surroundings and be open to the possibilities of what comes with this state of comfort [Music] allow your mind to quiet [Music] and the noises and the responsibilities of the world around you to turn off [Music] as you still may have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer [Music] and by the space between your thoughts to extend [Music] just as you did with the space between your breaths [Music] in just a moment you are going to continue this practice of awareness as you bring your attention to your physical body in order to relax each part of your body beginning at the top of your head moving all the way down to the bottom of your feet I will guide you through this process and as you hear each part of your body being spoken you will first bring your awareness to that area simply noticing how it feels without judgement [Music] and then you will relax that part deeply [Music] and now turn your attention to the top of your head first visualize and feel your scalp and head [Music] and then welcome in relaxation [Music] as you begin to progressively release each muscle notice how powerful your awareness is [Music] and how just a thought in your mind can have the ability to relax your entire body so deeply [Music] continuing the scan of your body feel your forehead soften and smooth since your eyebrows and your eyes [Music] as they began to melt noticing the tiny muscles around your eyes release perhaps you can feel that your eyelids are becoming very heavy notice your cheeks soften  allow your teeth to part  unclench your jaw and relax your tongue feel your throat softening  and notice as your neck let's go of any held tension invite this relaxation to move into your shoulders feel the warm comfort moving downward as the tension melts out of your shoulders moving down your arms and flowing out of your body through your fingertips with each breath notice the contraction and expansion of your abdomen and chest as the sensation of heaviness washes over you now allow your chest to relax completely perhaps you notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax even more  what other sensations do you notice in this moment  the simple process of noticing your breath noticing your physical body and your surroundings [Music] is such a powerful tool for relaxation and stress relief bringing you into the present  notice as this comfort begins to move down your body now releasing the tension from your lower back and your hips your thighs feel heavy and sink into the surface below you your knees soften  and you allow your calves to melt  and as your body continues to rest your ankles and feet let go of any remaining tension your body feels to be completely relaxed to be safe and supported you now allow yourself to drift even further into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go completely  as you continue to be aware of your breath and your physical body in this moment follow the sound of my voice on this journey of relaxation  take notice of any thoughts or distractions that may come into your mind simply acknowledge the thought and allow your breath to carry it away now as you continue to relax begin to use your imagination and see yourself on a soft fluffy white cloud  this cloud is special and it is just for you when you lay down on this cloud it fits you perfectly it supports you entirely so you can let go of any need for holding on  as you rest on this cloud you will safely take a journey as it drips you off to your favorite place this is a peaceful place with your

that when you are in this perfect peaceful place nothing bad can happen you are safe you are supported you are completely in control I am simply your guide here in this deeply tranquil state

worry expectations and the need to be in complete control at all times is the way past resistance being mindful is the practice of noticing and allowing the experience without judgment as we begin to settle into our meditation practice they invite you to make yourself comfortable sit or lie down in a way that allows you to find ease in a position where you feel safe to be supported by the surface below you so you can completely let go of the need to hold yourself up or to control your posture this intentional choice is sending your brain a message that you are ready to relax into the flow of this practice and the flow of the energy of life begin to make any small subtle adjustments to your body to welcome the relaxed peaceful state to wash over your entire physical body and your consciousness as you are beginning to surrender into the calm bring your attention to the natural rhythm of your breath your body and your brain are always working together to breathe so you don't have to constantly be thinking about it however the simple act of mindfully attending to your breath deepening your breath and being intentional about it sends a message that it is okay to relax now is the time for inviting ease into your body take an intentionally slow and deep breath and take another one take your time filling up as much as you can and slow down your exhale as well be patient with your breath feel as your next breath happens to you easily and effortlessly perhaps deepening and slowing down your natural rhythm and now simply allow your breath to continue on its own relax into your breath let it be as your breath finds an easy natural flow move your attention to your physical body the intention as you scan your body is loving compassionate allowing of what is it is all part of who you are send an invitation to release what does not serve you slowly bring your awareness to your toes since this area without judgments or expectations what do you notice [Music] what would it be like to relax this area your intention to bring your awareness to a specific part of your body gives it permission to relax by simply noticing you can find ease moving your attention slowly up your body as you sense the soles of your feet you are ankles your calves and your knees if there is any area of your body that is speaking to you keep your attention there a little longer breathe into that area invite a release allow whatever you're feeling to be what it is and to pass through you rather than pushing it down no need to label what you are sensing simply experience it and allow it to release and relax take as long as you need attending to each part of your body perhaps you are ready to move your attention up to your thighs your hips your abdomen and low back our physical body holds on to emotions and can be resistant to letting go by attending to the sensations as they arise breathing into what you experience and patiently allowing they will pass through you then you will bring ease and comfort into your body what would it feel like to release the pain and discomfort from your body relax into the resistance now move your attention to your ribs your chest and your heart open your heart open the energy of your heart with loving-kindness and compassion for yourself and others this is a safe place to let down the protective wall that has perhaps been surrounding your heart what would it be like to open your heart to give your love and energy freely and to be open to receive it back if this brings up sensations or a shift in emotions come back to the intention of loving compassionate allowing of what is let it be  release what does not serve you moving your attention to your shoulders your arms your hands  and fingers continue to relax each body part as your attention washes over it  since now the area of your neck and throat can you let go of any tightness holding or guarding can you find more space for the energy to flow freely here what would it be like for this area to be open giving and receiving of energy like the area of your heart sensing the release of your jaw cheeks eyes forehead and scalp  take one more patient scan of your body to welcome a little more love compassion and relaxation to any areas that may still need it it is all part of what makes you unique let it be allow it now that your body is relaxed and you have let go of any tightness or tension in your physical body I will guide you to explore your emotions mindfully know that you are in a safe space and you can open your eyes and stop at any time if you feel the need to do so consider something in your life where you may be experiencing resistance simply recognize the emotions arising that surround this experience whatever you're feeling is okay it is safe to be vulnerable right now during your practice during meditation there is no guilt or judgments there is no right or wrong perhaps there is something you have been denying for some time know that whatever it is that you are resisting is simply an obstacle on your path it is part of your journey these moments are opportunities for learning and growth because this may be a negative or challenging emotion do your best to let down your guard let down your armor to what you are feeling as it is make space for awareness and acceptance without judgment this experience these emotions are part of you and they are okay simply allow know that Worry has not solved any problems or prevented any disasters worried brings unnecessary suffering and takes away from experiencing the present moment to the fullest resistance brings your energy to what you do not want rather than what you do want what would it be like to trust the situation and allow as you continue to explore see deeply into the situation are there any recurring thoughts images beliefs or stories associated with this resistance know that you are enough trust and allow the experience with love and compassion for yourself and others for the next few moments continue relaxing into the resistance with patience breathe into it  let it be slowly bring your attention back to your physical body back to the surface below you bring some gentle movements to your body to re-energize you as you are slowly coming out of the state of relaxation know that you can patiently continue to relax into the resistance whether physical or emotional come back to this meditation practice as often as you need trust you are enough allow mindfully and know that the experience itself is not you let go and rest in awareness itself things are just as they are when you are ready open your eyes with love and compassion for yourself 
0 when you resist or resent difficult emotions you add unnecessary suffering to your experience [Music] if you are able to recognize these difficult emotions with love and compassion you allow them to move through you and can reduce the added suffering you can use this powerful practice of being present and nurturing these difficult emotions with love and compassion today you can use my guidance to start and then use this practice on your own anytime you need it as we begin i invite you to make yourself comfortable as you settle into comfort begin to notice your breath as a way to come into your present moment experience allow your breath to be just as it is and as you come into presence welcome a softening a letting go of any hell tension as your attention to your breath allows you to relax just a little bit further [Music] become aware of your physical sensations notice if there are any difficult emotions arising that are making it more difficult to be [Music] present you might notice where in your body you are feeling this difficult emotion [Music] and if it feels right to you you can place your hand on that area [Music] this gesture is showing you that you cherish yourself do your best to let go of the story around your emotions [Music] let go of any expectations you might have and simply feel the sensations within your body [Music] this practice is not about what you are experiencing it is more about how you are responding to those sensations [Music] when you allow yourself to feel these sensations you have the choice to respond to them [Music] in a positive way so that you don't allow these emotions to control you [Music] right now as you're sitting in your present moment experience you are choosing to respond to your emotions with compassion and loving kindness [Music] staying in the present moment continuing to notice and accept your emotions and your physical experience [Music] begin to inquire within and ask yourself what is it that would help me in this time what would best serve my experience right now you have the opportunity to let go of the story to feel your emotions [Music] and to meet these feelings with kindness [Music] you might offer yourself the phrase i am here for you or i love and care for you just like a friend or a loved one might offer support to you [Music] by showing yourself this love and support you can create a safe space for your emotions to come forward [Music] and take the next few moments of silence to offer yourself love and nurturing to this area where you are sensing strong emotions if that feels difficult you might imagine this loving nurturing experience coming from a loved one [Music] or this nurturing might come from some other form of energy [Music] so [Music] begin to deepen your breath let the inflow of air bring more love more nurturing to anywhere in your body that might still need it [Music] know that with each breath in you have an opportunity to pause be with your emotions and meet those emotions with love and compassion and now begin to become aware of your surroundings notice any sounds around you [Music] perhaps you begin to notice your fingers and toes once more and when you feel ready take another deep breath in and as you let it out allow your eyes to softly blink open [Music] and know that you can take this pause recognize your strong emotions and meet them with love and compassion at any time you need come back to this practice as often as you need and i thank you for practicing with me today i hope you have a peaceful day
0 I am grateful you have chosen me to be your guide today please subscribe to this channel for more guided meditations each week and consider sharing with anyone you think can find value from these videos and now I invite you to make yourself comfortable make any large shifts in your position to find a resting place of ease take your time make any small and subtle adjustments to your body to fully relax perhaps releasing your facial expressions from around your eyes and your mouth allow all the tiny muscles in your face and jaw to soften and let go settle into ease allow the settling to flow into your mind as well you it takes time and patience to quiet the busy mind just like stretching a muscle requires relaxation to let the muscle lengthen the mind requires relaxation to slow down to make space you today we will intentionally attend to our breath to bring about the relaxation response to help let go of stress to let go of any negativity that you may be holding on to to let go of the need for perfection and control and to let go of anything else that may be limiting you now I invite you to breathe in deeply through your nose and breathe out through your mouth with a relaxed jaw making a sigh noise continue breathing deeply for a few cycles while observing your breath as soon as all of your air is released allow your next breath in begin to notice the moment when your exhale flows right into your inhale and then when your inhale becomes your next exhale and on and on the flow goes like an ocean wave coming into Shore and rolling back out again you may notice that your breath has returned to its natural rhythm we're not controlled the breath has an automated tempo and depth feel the sensation of being breathed receiving the breath into your body there is a force greater than us working to send breath into our bodies and it is our job to allow it to invite in the breath we can only control our breath for so long before it returns to automation the same is true in life you now moving your attention to each exhale to breathe out is to let go of air to let go of energy to surrender to the natural rhythm of breath for the next few breaths focus on each exhale has a time to let go perhaps on your next breath in make fists with your hands and squeeze them tightly and as you exhale literally let go of the tension release your grip let go of anything you're holding on to as you breathe out and feel the sensation ripple through the rest of your body and with each subsequent exhale let go of what you no longer need it may be pain it may be anger it may be heartbreak or it maybe control whatever it is for you simply let it go let go of tension let go of any heaviness weighing on you [Music] [Music] continue to attend to your natural breath rhythm mindfully [Music] observing all you can about your breath our breath is always with us and by using it as a focal point we become present we cannot get back to a past breath and we cannot breathe a future breath the only breath we have is this one in the present moment by using breath as a focal point as part of our meditation practice we develop the conditioning to know that at anytime we need we can simply shift our focus to our breath perhaps during a stressful interaction with a loved one while stuck in traffic or as anxiety builds there is no need to bring out the meditation cushion in order to practice being mindful we can simply and mindfully breathe and as we have practiced today our breath has the ability to bring about the familiar state of relaxation and calm [Music] you [Music] with practice you will find that perhaps this conditioned relaxation becomes your reflexive response showing up naturally and quickly [Music] breathing naturally brings oxygen to your blood into your brain to bring about the feeling of safety and with this feeling of safety comes the relaxation response just like an intentional smile bring the sensations of happiness mindful breathing bring the sensations of calm to the mind and body stress and relaxation cannot exist together much like the way light cancels out darkness inviting relaxation into the body can cancel out any remaining stress or tension your breath will bring a sensation of release to each part of your body and now imagine breathing into your shoulders and neck since the natural movement in this area that is connected to your breath rhythm like an ocean wave can invite the sensation to move down from your shoulders through your arms and hands visualize the movement of your breath pulsing through each arm and hand to relax fully and by your breath to fill your chest ribs and abdomen making space for energy to flow freely open your heart with a sense of lightning and then soften your belly peel from the inside the flowing quality of your breath as it travels the length of your body see the breath now moving down into your hips and legs relax your ankles and feet with each wave of breath and since the breath now in the soles of the feet sense the breath going to every cell in your body healing with life's energy stay with your breath and the sensations that come along with it for the next few moments of silence begin now to activate the muscles in your face and around your eyes with an intentional joyful smile feel the smile wash over your face and notice what a simple smile can do for how you are feeling continue to smile for a few more moments feeling the sense of joy building inside you and when you are ready begin to bring some gentle movements to your fingers and your toes moving the energy through your limbs and when you are ready open your eyes knowing that you can always come back to your breath mindfully thank you so much for listening I hope you have a beautiful day

energy to those parts stay with the sensations a short while longer and reflect on the amazing ability and automatic functions of your body send gratitude and vitality to each and every part of your body your heart and your soul invite your attention to rest on your breath as it flows in its natural rhythm now notice its path its tempo and its fullness perhaps your breath is beginning to slow down and deepen as you relax or maybe you feel your breath has become shallow or even pauses momentarily whatever you're experiencing is perfect simply be with the sensations as they arise feel the sensations of being breathed receiving the breath into your body filling you up restoring your energetic balance and sense of calm to breathe in is to fill up with air to fill up with healing life-giving energy focus on your inhale for the next few breaths like a pitcher being filled up with water from the bottom to the top this is our ability to nourish and heal ourselves there is a force greater than us working to send breath into our bodies and it is our job to allow it to invite in the breath we need to both breathe in to fill up as well as to breathe out to let go in order to be balanced to breathe out is to let go of air to let go of energy to surrender to the natural rhythm of breath you can let go to make room for nourishing energy to fill you up consider each breath out as a time for releasing any unwanted energies and developing the energy you do desire this is your time to heal and let go life nature and every energetic being experiences a natural ebb and flow an inhalation period as well as an exhalation period and life is the balance of expending energy and restoring energy a balance of growth and rest for the next few breaths focus on each exhale as a time

0 lao-tzu once said nature does not hurry yet everything is accomplished just as the way water patiently erodes the surface of Iraq we too can soften over time when we follow the path of least resistance and let go of our struggles we add unnecessary suffering to our experience when we want our reality to be something other than what it really is with patience for the process we can release our resistance accept what is and we can experience peace letting go of resistance and experiencing acceptance is an ongoing practice it is one that can be especially difficult yet extremely useful during challenging and uncertain times slowing down and discovering patience during meditation is like training for our day-to-day life experiences enjoy the process be patient allow yourself to learn and grow and trust the journey hello and welcome I'm Sarah Raymond thank you for joining me today let's begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes gently and take a patient deep

let go of the Counting [Music] take a moment to simply notice how you are feeling after practicing a few deliberate relaxing breaths [Music] invite your attention to effortlessly drift around your physical sensations to notice your current state observe the quality of the state you're in without making any changes or judging where you are simply check-in are you calm what is your heart rate like at this moment what are the sensations you are experiencing in your body are you warm or cool what else is your attention drawn to as the observer of your natural state [Music] what can you patiently discover about yourself as you look inward on your experience [Music] [Music] now that you have observed your unchanged experience scan through your body once more look for anywhere you can let go the tendency to hold on is there anywhere in your physical body that you can let go let go of tension let go of tightness or pain there may be areas that are holding on that you weren't even aware of until you patiently looked inward today right now I invite you to welcome more ease into your body [Music] what would it feel like in your body to slow down and discover peace [Music] [Music]

experiences a natural ebb and flow of energy an inhalation period as well as an exhalation period [Music] life is the balance of giving and receiving of expending energy and conserving energy it is up to you to discover patience and Trust this journey [Music] as humans energetically we can learn from the rhythms of nature each of the seasons has its own energy and symbolism that indicates where nature is in its yearly cycle you can learn from the seasons and their energetic changes to help you move through your own seasonal cycle and energetic shift each season has meaning and can invite contemplation of the connections of nature to your own experiences fall is a time of letting go of what no longer serves you letting go so you can welcome in change and new beginnings winter can be a time of stillness to go within perhaps planning for the future and nurturing what is important to you and after the cold dark time of winter spring brings a sense that your soul is rested and at the same time spring carries the promise of renewal like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon [Music] summer is bursting with light and growth and freedom [Music] these symbols of nature's seasons may relate to different seasons of your life the reminder is that everything changes and goes through stages no matter the season that you are experiencing now consider the energy of the seasons as you contemplate this cycle in nature as well as your own life what is your experience can you discover the patience of nature and use it to cultivate the same patience within yourself what would it be like to allow yourself to slow down let go of resistance and Trust the journey [Music] [Music] fall can be a reminder for you to acknowledge and accept the impermanence and brief nature of things winter encourages you to go within and conserve your energy while spring and summer offer the beauty of new growth the warmer months are a reminder to appreciate all of the beauty that surrounds us in this world tomorrow is not guaranteed and we have the opportunity to enjoy this moment and live every day to the fullest [Music] the lessons and energy from each season can change your mood it can change your perspectives and therefore your choices nature is a reminder to recognize that all things change all things are beautiful and perfect in their own unique way at just the right time nature doesn't rush its process all changes happen seasons change and everything gets accomplished without worry [Music] bring your awareness to the sensations and energy of your body once more take a patient deep breath in and let it out as slowly as you can since a building of energy within you know that like nature the Sun shines the light on what we may not have seen before you have taken the time to go inward to slow down and discover the beauty of patience to recognize that you can trust the journey you can welcome the changes and stages of your life just like nature breathe that in feel

0 welcome to the short morning meditation for allowing abundance we also have a longer version of this meditation that can also be used before bed for more powerful effect the mindset of abundance is the opposite of scarcity abundance is the overflowing and over sufficient quantity of that which you desire and you have the power to invite it into your life you have the choice to change the way you look at things take the next few minutes with this meditation to prepare your mindset for the day ahead and watch as abundance flows easily into your life as we begin allow your eyes to close gently and focus your attention on your breath by simply being mindful and intentional with your breath your body sends a signal to your brain that you are safe and can relax and focus on what's important taken five deep intentional and relaxing breaths invite in a sense of comfort and relaxation with each breath in breathe into the heart and expand the capacity of this space with each breath out let go of tension let go of distractions let go of the need to control your thoughts [Music] allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and flow and as you continue to relax I will guide you on a journey this journey will take you on a path to release any negative beliefs or ideas that could be holding you back from the abundance you desire then you will bring in the energy of abundance into the space you create for it when you let go of fears I invite you now to open your imagination and step into a field of beautiful wildflowers look around you as you stand on a path that leads you right down the center of the field here you are surrounded on both sides by flowers and the most vivid colors use your senses to take in this beautiful and peaceful environment around you see the clear bright sky above you feel that the temperature of the air is perfect for you and the Sun shines on you gently warming your skin the faint smell of the flowers is just right for your liking perhaps you hear birds chirping in a distance or see butterflies flitting around as you look around you can see many beautiful colors in all directions around you you sense that you are safe and peaceful in this place in your imagination you begin to walk along this path down the center of the field moving towards some rolling hills of even more wildflowers [Music] as you walk you have a feeling that you are carrying around something extra something weighing you down making you feel heavy and tired you reach into your pockets and feel that surprisingly there are some smooth stones these stones that you are carrying around weighing you down represent your fears and your feelings of not enough they represent anything known or unknown to you that is holding you back each stone is something that is blocking the flow of abundance to you slowly take one stone out of your pocket and leave it on the path behind you as you continue walking slowly feel a space open up inside of you as you let go of something negative in your life there's no need to label what you're letting go of simply let go knowing it is something that is no longer supporting your goals and desires for abundance continue to do the same with each of the remaining stones in your pocket one at a time take your time and feel the energetic shift feel the space you have opened up for flow [Music] now that you have let go of that which no longer serves you and you have made room for the flow of abundance invite it in letting go of resistance gives way to an attitude of allowing allow in positive energy

0 I have a guided meditation to help you relax this practice is great for putting a pause on a stressful experience or negative emotions and simply connecting inward and now let's begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable choosing any position that allows you to feel fully supported where you can relax and let go [Music] choose a position that you know you are safe and gives you the opportunity to [Music] focus inward [Music] perhaps close your eyes if you like [Music] and begin to settle in [Music] make any small subtle adjustments to your posture patiently think deeper into comfort take your time there's no rush here you set aside this time where no one needs anything from you or no responsibilities for the next little while [Music] let this be a pleasure for you to enjoy [Music] and as you settle into comfort allow your attention to rest at the sensations of your hands [Music] notice the palms of your hands [Music] and since the tops of your hands [Music] and notice all the way to the very tips of your fingers [Music] and since both hands as a whole [Music] notice if there's a temperature around the area of your hands do you sense energy perhaps buzzing or a vibration or tingling [Music] whatever you are feeling it's just right [Music] this practice is simply about looking for what's there recognizing your true experience in this present moment [Music] can you sense a feeling of weight at the area of your hands maybe your hands feel very heavy and solid into the surface below you or perhaps I feel light as if they could float off the surface below you and drift into the air [Music] notice if there's a color around the area of your hands that can be sensed [Music] and now with a relaxed awareness welcome your attention to rest on your feet notice the tops of your feet and ankles [Music] notice your toes [Music] and the soles of your feet [Music] is there a temperature you are aware of at the area of your feet [Music] is it warm or cool [Music] or simply neutral are you able to sense heavy or light at the area of your feet [Music] perhaps you notice a color when your attention rests at the area of your feet [Music] is there an energetic quality at the area of your feet [Music] allowing your attention to continue to stay here at the area of your feet [Music] imagine bringing in energy from the earth from all around you [Music] imagine bringing in this energy from the soles of your feet as if they were permeable [Music] the energy moves in from the soles of your feet and it intuitively moves to wherever your body needs it [Music] your body and this energy coming in from the outside flow as if dancing together [Music] creating a beautiful flow of energy filling you up [Music] where you maybe depleted [Music] moving excess energy where there may be a buildup since this energy swirling around you flowing throughout your entire body [Music] letting go of excess energy through the crown of your head and drawing in energy to refill you from the soles of your feet [Music] perhaps you can sense this energy [Music] like a warm embrace from a loved one or perhaps it feels like the weight of a heavy warm blanket [Music] stay with this flow of energy [Music] for just a little longer allowing your body to connect with the energy [Music] so that the energy knows where to go [Music] now sensing the areas of your hands and your feet once more bringing some gentle movements to those areas feeling the energy building up at your hands and your feet once more and take a moment as we close the practice to connect with that perfect level of energy feel it in your body like muscle memory know that you have the ability to come back to this moment this sensation any time you need it is already within you your body knows how to find balance it may just need a little loving attention and encouragement when it feels right to you open your eyes I hope you have a wonderful day thank you so much for practicing with me I'd love to hear how your practice went share in the comments below and I look forward to practicing with you again

0 welcome and thank you for listening to this guided meditation to practice using a positive internal dialogue as you go through your day there is a continuous dialogue that occurs inside your head often planning for the future or remembering events of the past frequently this includes expectations all of the shoulds and the judgments we have of ourselves that may come from others or from internally sometimes we may knowingly or unknowingly repeat negative statements in our head have negative beliefs or engage in negative self-talk our subconscious mind listens to all of the internal dialogue that goes on whether positive or negative these thoughts act as affirmations and the more we listen to them the more we believe them the chatter in our minds that goes on each and every day is energy and has the potential to play a strong role in our beliefs as well as the energy we send out into this world each time we say these negative things or they are told to us we begin to believe them we send out negative energy and that negative energy comes back to us and these negative thoughts take root in our subconscious they can affect what happens in our lives the choices we make and the way we interact with others each thought has a ripple effect outward on our life much like a stone thrown into a lake making small waves outward knowing this gives us the ability to choose instead to effect ourselves in a positive way we can retrain our minds by using positive thoughts and sending out positive energy by repeating positive affirmations in our mind and out loud these two will become beliefs today we will first begin to relax our body in our mind with attention to our breath and a connection to our senses I invite you to make yourself comfortable you take a moment to settle in you have chosen to take this time to honor yourself in a positive way by bringing mindfulness to the way you live you are strengthening the connection between your body and your mind if you like allow your eyes to close gently down and take a moment to bring your awareness to your breath without changing or forcing your breath notice its natural pace its natural depth and the path it takes inside of your body listen to the sound your breath makes on the inside hear the sound building as you inhale and softening as you let it go hear the rhythm of your breath as it relates to your heartbeat are they aligned whatever you hear is as it should be simply listen and now attend to your sense of smell as you breathe smell the air as it comes into your nostrils what do you sense without attaching a label to the sense simply experience what is around you feel your breath now feel the movement of your breath feel the expansion in your lungs feel the rise and fall of your body perhaps since the way your clothes contact your skin or how the surface below you feels as it connects with your body since the change as your ribs expand and since the pressure building and releasing between the front and back of your body maybe you can see your breath from within visualize its path notice where each breath travels within are there any areas your breath avoids or spends extra time in and since the relaxation and cleansing effect your breath has on your body and mind your breath has the power to bring you into peace begin now to feel the temperature of your breath as it flows into your body is it warm is it cool does it have the same temperature on the out-breath this awareness practice is about bringing focus to your senses there is no right or wrong way to do it no correct answers there is simply awareness and curiosity and what arises for you spend the next few moments being mindful of your senses and your breath as you continue to attend to your breath and your senses begin to explore your emotions as they arise with a curious and kind approach today I invite you to explore your habitual negative self-talk or beliefs without judgment perhaps consider how these things that you may say to yourself or believe about yourself might be limiting you from reaching your full potential and fulfilling your passions know that we are all human and we are perfectly imperfect without mistakes or failures or imperfections we would not grow we would not improve we would not learn new ways of doing things without darkness we would not know the beauty of light without sadness we would not know joy without pain we would not know pleasure know that these feelings coming up are simply energy moving through your body and out into the world and while you cannot stop these emotions you can stop them from taking over and dictating how you respond to your life's events you have the ability to respond in a positive and loving way the positive and loving energy you have in you when you interact with others can affect each event in life place your hand on your heart if you like and tell yourself that you love yourself sit with this feeling without judgment or expectations give love to yourself as you do for others know that you can pause for a moment out of your busy day at any time to say these words and reconnect to your heart practice repeating the following loving phrases in your mind or use your own positive phrases if you choose believe in these phrases in this present moment feel the truth of these statements in your body in your heart and in your mind I am enough I love you I am listening to what you need I am lovable just the way I am I am free beautiful and wise I am perfectly imperfect sit with these positive statements for a few more moments of silence and feel the love building inside of you and now welcome a deep breath into your body know that you can come back to your mindful attention often throughout your daily life you can meet your feelings where they are with kindness and compassion and you can continue to practice building a positive internal dialogue now bring your awareness back to your physical body to the sensations inside you in this present moment continue to invite in a building sense of love an honoring of your beautiful heart take in one more deep breath sending it into the area of your heart to make space for unconditional love and when you already open your eyes thank you so much for listening today
0 our current culture is fast-paced and frequently very demanding not allowing for very much downtime to recover it's not surprising that many of us have experienced stress overwhelm and anxiety at some point in our lives these feelings are often caused by the racing and overactive thoughts of our mind meditation is a wonderful tool to help quiet the busy mind in the moment and also to practice being able to balance and Center our emotions for future situations you have already taken the most difficult step to helping yourself you have chosen to take time to practice this guided meditation let's begin find a posture of comfort sit or lie down so you can experience ease in your body which will allow for ease in your mind we will start this meditation with your eyes open gently focus your line of vision on one point in front of you you can find a spot on the floor or the wall and now narrow your focus to this one single point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away see all that you can see about this one single point now slowly broaden your field of view like a camera lens widening with a relaxed awareness notice everything you can see in your current much broader line of you without having to turn your head what colors textures and materials do you see do you see brightness or dim light around you [Music] take it all in once more slowly narrow your field of view to the same single point as your focus narrows continue to draw it in until your eyes gradually closed and you invite your attention to turn inward and now start to notice the natural rhythm and depth of your breath without making any changes just notice listen to the sound of your breath look for any movement of your body that is connected to your breath [Music] and now intentionally begin to deepen each breath in and slow down on your exhale as you slow down and deepen your breath take time to notice all there is to experience about your breath [Music] and explore how your breath might change slightly as you continue to look inward [Music] simply notice the experience of your breath without expectations and without judgments what would it be like to offer your breath some love and compassion like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down in relationship to each breath as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen be in the gap no need to do anything simply be in this space without expectations what do you notice in stillness [Music] this is a judgment-free practice of allowing what is there to come to the surface with curiosity [Music] [Music] if you find your mind wandering or your sense of calm begin to dissipate come back to your breath and the gap between thoughts [Music] when we slow down we notice more when we are in the gap we notice what we might otherwise be missing when we rush or overthink experience your body being breathed and let your attention rest on the space between breath and thought [Music] now broaden your awareness to the physical experience of your body look inside and since the energy and feelings of one single point at the area of your stomach what do you notice at this one small focal point [Music] similar to broadening your visual focal point begin to widen the experience of your sensations moving outward from your stomach notice where your body makes a connection with the surface below you perhaps you sense there is a blurring of the lines that separate you from the support and from the energy around you or maybe you feel pressure or warmth at this connection continue gradually moving this relaxed scan of your body helped from your Center notice if there are any parts that are making contact with another part of your body [Music] awaken to the sensations in your body moving out from your Center now since the aliveness in your hands and in your feet [Music] feel the energy moving within you [Music] inhabit your body fully when we can do this live in this body sense our own aliveness we are in the present and living in the space between our thoughts when your mind is attentive to the sensations of your body you can pause you can extend the gap between your thoughts this gap is where you can experience peace and calm notice now if there is anywhere you can soften a little bit more look for any where you can let go even deeper into relaxation and ease let your physical body go so that you can let your thoughts go [Music] imagine your thoughts are like a river flowing gently downstream let your thoughts go so you can be here now awake to the sensations in your body [Music] what would it be like to relax a tense muscle right now what would it feel like to let go of tension and tightness look inside for any areas of your body that are telling you something sometimes the simple act of attending to a sensation allows it to soften or fade away our body wants to be heard to be recognized [Music] invite your attention to move to the areas of your body that are telling you something and feel the sensations there quiet your thoughts to hear the sensations [Music] if you find your mind drifting going back to old patterns of thinking or overthinking lovingly come back gesture your attention to come back to the sensations once more stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment longer knowing that you can always come back to this state of quiet because it has always been a part of you [Music] [Music] take another full breath in and let it out as slowly as you can and do this again letting go of your breath letting go of tension letting go of your busy mind as you brought in your field of awareness once more look for habits or recurring tendencies that you may have to leave your body and come back as many times as you need start over with you're aware presence in life outside of meditation look for patterns when you might be rushing and come back to experience life fully when we slow down and stay with the sensations as long as we can we notice more we live more fully when we are trying to control our life to make it just the way we want it to be perfect we are not experiencing all that life has to offer listen to what wants to be heard see what wants to be seen to do this slow down cause in the gap between thoughts quiet our thoughts to see hear and feel deeply and have it your body fully and be open to life when you were already open your eyes I hope you have a peaceful and calm day thank you for practicing with me

body in your mind's eye relax that body part completely scan for any areas of tension tightness or pain or any areas that you feel the energy is stuck and not flowing freely if there are areas of tension keep your focus on that body part for a moment and breathe uh warm glowing light into that area to soften it this warm loving light will melt the tension away from your body and allow you to fully relax it will allow the energy to move throughout your entire body freely see the tension melting away down into the surface below you to be gone from your body forever as you continue scanning your body feel this loving energy move through your entire body as it takes you deeper and deeper into a safe and supported state of relaxation and now continue scanning your body and bringing loving relaxing energy to each part of your body in this next moment of silence and now that you are in a safe and comfortable state of relaxation imagine that you are standing at the top of a beautiful white marble staircase see the staircase in vivid detail you rest your hand on the smooth cool marble banister that runs down beside the staircase as you look down the stairs you notice that there are ten steps leading down these are steps that will lead you deeper into relaxation in a moment as I begin to count you will walk down these steps you will find that the deeper down you go the more comfortable and the more relaxed you will become so now you can hold on to the beautiful banister and begin to slowly descend the stairs as I count 10 you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do eight you know you are right where you need to be on your journey and you allow the outside world to turn off seven this step takes you even deeper into a relaxed state six you are committed to taking your life and dreams to the next level five as you descend you feel the familiar state of freedom in your body and clarity in your mind that comes with this relaxation for going deeper and deeper into comfort three almost to the bottom of the staircase almost to the light two deep deep into relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and now that you have reached the bottom of the staircase you are completely relaxed and comfortable they take a moment to look at your surroundings you realize that the light you see is shining out from behind a partially closed door at the bottom of a staircase it is seeping out from the edges of the door expanding its light outward you have a sense that behind this door is all that you are capable of and all of your inner potential this light is shining out only a little bit allowing only some of your potential to be seen you know that before this door can be opened all the way there are things that you must let go of and now take a moment and first let go of any negativity you may be holding on to this negativity doesn't have to be named specifically just let it go but the energy of negativity go what you put out into the world will come back to you put out positivity send out love and light radiate this energy outward to the world and it will come back to you give what you wish to receive and let go of limiting beliefs of yourself see these beliefs floating away from your body like a feather in the wind and replace the old limiting beliefs with new positive beliefs these limitations we put on ourselves could be holding us back from moving forwards towards our ideal life and towards contentment let it all go let go of any expectations you have of yourself and in any expectations you believe others have for you let go of the need to please anyone but you and take care what others think let go of attachments let it all go let go of competition with yourself and with others let go of the idea of being perfect and the need to always be right let go of the shoulds in your life and replace these thoughts with the idea that you are enough being enough means being comfortable with your body as it is today being comfortable with what you have achieved as well as what you have not being enough means self-acceptance and it is something we could all say to ourselves more often let it all go let go of excuses let go of judgmental thoughts let go of jealousy and thoughts of not enough let go of insecurities let it all go let go of the past in order to move forward let go of worries for the future let go of fear forgive allow the past to be the past and not create your destiny be here now be present be mindful be grateful be joyful and be loved and let go of anything else that is no longer serving you and now that you have let go of all negativity and replaced it with positive love and light now you know it is time to open this door all the way to let the light shine out all the way so you can live to your fullest potential so now reach forward to open the door and as you place your hand on the doorknob and pull all of your inner strength determination and possibilities flow out filling up your mind and the space around you feel the strength and positivity flow out from your mind and fill your entire body and into your heart you are now completely full with potential and possibilities you are confident and capable you are creative and intelligent you are enough and more because you have let go of all the negative in your life you have the space to fill up with your full potential you know you are able to achieve great things now that your inner strength and potential have been released from behind this door and now walk into this light feel the energy and strength of your full potential surrounding you filling you up this energy builds your confidence and motivation on the other side of the door you find a bench to sit down on and you take this new energy confidence and motivation and allow your mind to wander and be imaginative to be open to possibilities and now I'd like you to imagine yourself as a small puzzle piece fitting nicely into the full puzzle that is your life each person in your life is a puzzle piece surrounding you and each fitting perfectly together each facet of your job your family your friends is also part of this puzzle when you change the pieces surrounding you the closest on the puzzle must change as well to stay connected all these changes take time and require patience and some pieces may not fit as well next to your puzzle piece and may need to be switched with another piece that does fit you have the ability in awareness to help this process filter out the pieces that no longer fit as well as have the patience for those pieces that take time to change you are open to change and the opportunities that come with these changes you choose to soften into these possibilities lovingly you live in alignment with your values and you're willing to give a little and be flexible you understand it takes time for changes to happen and take root yet you are grateful for where you are on this journey you know you are exactly where you are supposed to be right now in life we often need to let go of what does not serve us in order to make room for change in order to be open to the process of change this isn't always easy but you are committed to doing what is right for your best interest and what is in alignment with your values rather than what's easy with change comes various emotions and you welcome them and seek to feel them understand them embrace them and then let them go when necessary you don't give up at times of unexpected pain or challenge you persevere all of your thoughts are positive in your mind you repeat after me I am open to change I am worthy of love and success I am confident I am diligent in moving towards my desired success I believe in myself and my abilities I am courageous and brave I am authentically me I am full of joy I am creating my own future I follow my dreams with passion and certainty I let go of the past and focus on the now I am enough I am grateful for today feeling confident and relaxed you get up from the bench and walk back through the doorway to reach the bottom of the stairs as you stand at the bottom of the stairs you have a strong sense that you can achieve whatever it is you set your mind to you know you are capable of achieving your dreams and you have the potential to accomplish great things here today you have let go of negativity and anything that no longer serves you to make space for the new and for the positive you have unlocked your full potential you can feel this energy flowing through you like an energetic life force that was always there but needed to be unlocked you have planted the seeds for your potential to grow and each day including today you are taking action watering those seeds to move in the direction of your full potential now that you have let go of negativity and have unlocked

0 in challenging or stressful times it is important to connect with your physical sensations to ground your energy to recognize your emotions as they are and to remember that you are not your thoughts you are not your feelings or your emotions at times you may feel controlled by your thoughts and your emotions as if they become you but just as you walk out in the rain you are not the rain when you are experiencing anxiety you are not the anxiety anxiety is only an experience that you are having there is a big difference in saying to yourself I have anxiety or I am anxious versus saying I am experiencing anxiety in this moment the first statement is claiming that sensation as your own which your mind recognizes as something it wants to hold on to because you are the owner of it today is your time to release stress and anxiety you no longer need to take ownership of it take comfort in the fact that like all moments this moment too shall pass the more you can tenderly offer yourself love and kindness for your experience the less suffering you will experience [Music] thank you for joining me for this practice if you are new here I'm Sara Raymond from the mindful movement and if you are returning welcome back today I have a powerful and effective practice to help you relieve stress and anxiety and it starts with humming if you would like more information about this practice of humming and its effects you can take a look at the mindful tip video listed in the description box below for now know that it is an effective tool to relax your nervous system so you can relieve

through your nose letting it out with a sigh and relax down just a bit further into the surface below you you can close your eyes if you haven't already and with your eyes closed since a gentle wave of relaxation sweeping over your entire body [Music] and as you settle in take a moment to scan through your body and wherever possible soften and release any obvious areas of physical tension [Music] now allow your attention to rest on your natural breath notice your breath as it arises and as it passes [Music] for the next several breath cycles I will guide you to begin counting your breath in and creating a humming sound on your exhale to begin this practice breathe out completely breathe in for a count of four then hold your breath for a count of two and then allow your exhale to slowly be released while producing a humming sound [Music] do this again breathe in four three two one hold to one and breathe out slowly while humming [Music] and continue this on your own [Music] and as you do know that it may take a few cycles to find a rhythm that works for you you can adjust the length of your inhale and the hold to suit your comfort level [Music] this is your safe opportunity to make a natural noise and feel the vibrations of sound without judgments of how it sounds [Music] invite this practice to be soothing and allow your mind and your body to drift into a very calm State as you continue take this time to remind yourself that you are safe notice the vibration of the sound [Music] [Music] and now allow your breath to normalize and notice how relaxed you have become you can let go of the controlled breathing pattern and now simply sense that you are receiving the breath just as you would be receiving any sounds you hear [Music] with a relaxed awareness discover what each breath is really like [Music] attending to your breath is like coming home to yourself coming home to a place where you can rest you can simply relax as each breath comes in notice what it's like and relax even more as you exhale with a relaxed awareness slowly scan your entire body allow your awareness to move over each part of your body noticing any areas that if possible can be softened and released of tension [Music] as you continue to notice the sensations connect directly to what you are feeling simply sense the feelings from within your body simply observe the sensations as they are and invite a sense of ease into your body you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part allows it to relax and let go [Music] in a moment I will guide you through a relaxing scan of your body guiding your attention to move strategically throughout your body to ground and restore your energy for the most tranquil experience you can rest assured your body is safe and supported and knows exactly what to do to relax so give yourself permission to relax fully as your attention moves through the areas of your body send the quality of love to each area become aware

0 This is a 5-minute “breathing space” practice that you can use anytime, anywhere to regain calm, clarity and confidence.  To begin, become physically still, wherever you are, either lying, sitting, or standing.  Choose a posture where you’ll be as comfortable as possible, and lightly close your eyes.  Bring your awareness to whatever is going on for you right now.  Give the weight of your body up to gravity.  Allow your weight to sink into the points of contact between your body and the floor, the chair, or bed.  What sensations are there right now?  If you notice any tension or resistance towards painful or unpleasant sensations, gently turn towards them.  Accept them as best you can.  If you begin to tense around the breath, then let go a little bit more with each outbreath.  Soften into gravity.  Notice any thoughts as they arise and pass through the mind.
0 Begin by finding a comfortable, relaxed position.  Allow your body to begin to relax.  Breathe in.... and out.....  Take a cleansing breath in.... and breathe out the tension in your body....  Feel relaxation beginning at the bottom of your feet. It might feel like stepping into a warm bathtub... or it may feel like a tingling sensation.... or simply calm and loose. Allow the relaxation to spread over your feet, and up to your ankles.  Feel the relaxation rising above your ankles, flowing up your lower legs.... to your knees.... continuing up to your upper legs...  Allow the relaxation to continue to spread throughout your body, rising now to your hips and pelvic area....  to your stomach and lower back.....  to your chest and upper back....  Let your upper arms relax.... your elbows.... lower arms.... and wrists... feel the relaxation spread to your hands... relaxing the palms of your hands.... the back of your hands.... each finger and thumb.... your hands feel pleasantly warm, heavy, and relaxed.  Feel your body relaxing further as the area by your collar bones widens and relaxes.... allow your shoulders to ease back slightly....  Allow your upper back to relax even further.... let your shoulders relax.... and your neck....  Feel the relaxation continue to spread to your chin... the back of your head.... your mouth.... your cheeks..... nose.... eyes....  Feel your eyelids, heavy and relaxed....  Notice your eyebrows relaxing.... your ears relaxing.... and your forehead.....  Your forehead feels cool and relaxed.....  Let the relaxation spread further to the top of your head....  Your entire body now is relaxed and calm. Feel the relaxation flowing throughout your body, from your head to your feet.  You can relax even further as you let your spine relax completely. Starting where the top of your spine meets your head, feel the relaxation.... feel the muscles giving up their hold and relaxing....  Feel the relaxation spread down your spine... down your neck.... upper back.... middle back .... and lower back.... all the way down to your tailbone at the bottom of your spine...  Notice all of the muscles of your back relaxing completely....  Feel the relaxation flowing throughout your body.  Breathe in.... now hold that breath. And relax your muscles totally, allowing the breath to flow gently out your nose or mouth.  Take another deep breath, breathing in relaxation....  And release the breath. Breathe out any remaining tension.  Continue to breathe smoothly and slowly as you mentally scan your body, looking for any remaining tension.  If you notice any tension, focus on that area. Direct the relaxation to flow into that area, and then carry the tension away.  Imagine that the air you are breathing can cleanse your body and remove tension. Imagine that each breath in carries relaxation. Picture the tension in your body leaving with each breath out.  Now simply relax, calmly, enjoying the feeling of relaxation for a few moments.  (pause)  Focus your attention now on your body, and think about the healing that needs to take place.  Create an image in your mind of your current state of being. Imagine the physical ailment that troubles you. It might be pain, or illness, or injury. It might be something diagnosed, or it may be a problem that is not yet identified. Whatever it is that you would like to heal, imagine this problem in your mind right now.  Focus on the specific location in your body where this problem is present.  You might want to imagine the problem as a dark area, and picture the healing relaxation as light. See the light of relaxation flowing through your body. Direct the light of healing relaxation toward the dark area.  Your body has many ways of healing itself. See the healing relaxation promoting your immune system.... promoting strength... promoting growth of healthy tissue.... removing unhealthy matter from your body.... removing toxins, bacteria, or waste.... cleaning up your body....  Imagine the light of healing relaxation flowing, swirling, touching the edges of the dark problem area in your body.  You might notice small pieces of the dark area being carried away by the healing relaxation.... allow these dark pieces to leave your body as you breathe out.  Breathe in health, healing, and calm....  Breathe out tension, illness, and any problems in your body....  Allow the light healing relaxation to continue swirling around the dark problem area... see the dark area getting smaller...  Imagine the dark area completely enveloped by relaxation....  See the healing relaxation making the dark area lighter.... and lighter... carrying away anything that is not good for your body....  Imagine your immune system working to heal you.... picture the cells you need going to the places they need to go.... working as needed to heal your body.....  Imagine the healing relaxation flowing, coursing through your body.....  Picture your body entirely filled with relaxation....  See the problem area your body is healing.... see it becoming even lighter.... filled with relaxation.... carrying away any discomfort..... healing.....  Allow your body to heal itself....  Take a cleansing breath in.... and breathe out what your body does not need....  Breathe in relaxation.... breathe out all the old air....  Relax for a few moments and imagine the healing process going on inside your body.... feeling confident in your body's ability to heal.... feeling calm and at peace....  (pause)  Now you can choose to return to your usual level of wakefulness and alertness, or drift into sleep.  If you choose to awaken, feel your body and mind becoming more aware of your surroundings.
0 Hello, and welcome to this meditation to relieve depression and anxious thoughts.  Make sure you are in a comfortable position and you will not be disturbed for the duration of this session.  Bring your focus to your breath, and really pay attention to how your lungs expand and contract when you inhale and exhale.  Let your breath flow how ever it wants to right now.  Notice your jaw, and if you feel any tension here, just notice it, don’t try to change anything.  Now breathe into the sensations in your jaw, and as you exhale, allow it to release a little.  Inhale again, imagine that you are breathing in new life, and when you exhale, let all fear completely fade.  Take another breath in, and when you exhale, feel yourself let go of any worries.  Notice how relaxed you are becoming right now.  Let another breath come in naturally imagining a bright future, and as you let it go, notice how depression eases and fades.  A gentle wave of relaxation sweeps over you as you breathe in and out.  Allow your breath to flow naturally now, let yourself feel calm and peaceful.  You deserve this wonderful feeling of serenity.  You are open now to receive new thoughts, and you open up even more with each breath you take to new and fresh energy.  Notice how new ideas begin to present themselves to you.  Bring up feelings of abundance, as if you have so much that your cup pours over for others to enjoy the abundance you have created.  Imagine that you are energized and have a zeal for life. 
0 you're listening to power thoughts meditation club thank you for being here i wonder now if you can imagine a tree outside an autumn imagine the leaves changing color from green yellow red brown and as time goes by more and more leaves just release from the tree letting go naturally and when winter comes the tree stands there without the leaves some people look at that tree and think that there's no life there i wonder if they've thought of all the life inside that tree all the processes going on inside that tree because when the spring comes the new fresh green leaves grow out again if it hadn't been for the autumn being there there would have been no room for the new green fresh sleeves i'm sorry and it's good to know that your subconscious mind works the same way naturally and safely it releases the old and i wonder now if you can allow yourself to access that deeper inner part of you that is calm serene and focused in your imagination everything is possible i'm sorry and the way you imagine your mental pictures the way you hear sounds and feel emotions and body sensations through this process now that is the right way for you to do this so imagine now that directly in front of you is a piece of pure quartz crystal just let your mind focus on that image see its shape texture and beauty and as you do so there is a warm gentle light that begins to glow within the crystal which grows brighter and more luminous as you focus on its energy you become aware of the crystal beginning to grow imagine now growing larger and larger brighter and brighter i'm sorry until the crystal is the size of a small house i am sorry its light pours out from each facet of the crystal and bathes you with warmth and gentleness making you feel so relaxed so peaceful and so calm you begin to explore the crystals in more detail and find now that there is a door which leads into the crystal the door is slightly open allowing a brighter gold light to flow out from the opening gently open the door so that you can walk into the crystal you have stepped into a crystal room which is there just for you this is your own special place the room can be in any shape or size you wish it to be just allow your imagination to create the rule as you want it to be in the colors that you love and feel peaceful with make it as comfortable as you want it to be it is your room i'm sorry please imagine that you look around the room and realize that you have not been in this place for a very long time a film of dust and debris has dulled the brightness of the crystal room so that the light cannot shine as brightly as it should in one corner of the room is a brew imagine now taking hold of the broom i'm sorry start sweeping up all dust and debris sweep it all out of the door and as the dust is swept outside imagine it being transformed bright glittering stardust and the debris is being absorbed into the golden light where it is transformed into positive vibrant energy imagine the dust and debris being negative thoughts that you now choose to let go of you can be at peace now as more and more of the dust and the breeze is swept away out of that door the light within the crystal room glows brighter and brighter so that you are surrounded now by a warm golden glow making you feel safe calmly and relaxed continue sweeping your room till every wall every facet every part of the floor is sparkling and clean clear and pure spring waters and while you are sweeping all your old negative thoughts they are being absorbed into the golden light where it is transformed into positive vibrant energy it is safe now to release these old thoughts and worries into the light and now repeat silently after me i choose to safely release these old unresourceful thoughts and worries with compassion and forgiveness knowing that whatever solution is necessary will manifest when the time is right repeat this to yourself so that you feel it with your whole being please feel the release let them go you can suddenly repeat after me now i am safe i choose think positive thoughts i choose to be free i allow myself to feel good i choose to focus on the positive side of life no matter how thick or thin you slice a bread you always have two sides i allow myself to heal from the inside out i choose to think thoughts that supports my life i allow myself to smile no matter where i am who i'm with what i do i choose to feel optimistic and focused i choose to let go of the old to make room for the new i am a part of nature i'm deep inside i am aware my thoughts create my reality therefore i choose my thoughts wisely i'm sorry from now on i allow myself to feel light and free i am worthy imagine now that you have completed to remove the debris and dust out of the room transformed into that light i'm sorry glittering stardust the imagine inside your room now there is a sofa bed i am walk towards the sofa bed lie down to rest in comfort now as you do so the golden light within the crystal room surrounds you bringing you peace calm and healing just rest for a while now with this nurturing golden light absorbing whatever your body needs for its healing at this time and your subconscious mind will integrate all these positive words i've told you i'm so unsafe and natural way perhaps there is someone you know to whom you wish to send loving and healing thoughts to or some situation that you feel may benefit from healing light take a few moments now to send out healing thoughts to anyone or anything that comes into your awareness now just allow this to happen if it's okay send your unconditional love and healing from your heart now so now that you have rested healed imagine getting up from the sofa bed and move slowly towards the door of the room taking your time to look around at this lovely bright place knowing that you can return here at any time reflect on how beautiful and luminous the light is in this room and store that knowledge in your heart knowing that this beautiful luminous light reflects your own inner light that beautiful unique part of you walk back through the door and imagine that the crystal begins to shrink in size shrinking more and more until it's just a tiny pin of light in your mind's eye you can access this place whenever you want to you can think about that quartz crystal light the brightness and whenever you need to heal whenever you need to feel good whenever you need to feel free come into your room inhale and every time you listen to my voice every time you listen to these words your unconscious mind will integrate this deeper and deeper within you at night when you sleep in your dreams these positive words will be compounded to be stronger and stronger and you'll feel better and better and

0 Hey there, and welcome to this meditation to help you reduce anxiety. First, I'd like to invite you to gently close your eyes and take a nice, slow, deep breath in, deeper than you've taken all day so far. And as you exhale, concentrate on the sound of my voice, allowing it to ground you into the present moment, and giving yourself permission right now to focus on you, making yourself your first priority. There is nowhere else you need to be. There is nothing else you need to be doing. For the next several minutes, your wellbeing is your focus. Continue to take slow, deep breaths, allowing each inhale to be a bit deeper than the one before it. Feeling your lungs expand out as you inhale, holding it for a beat and contracting back in as you exhale. And as you continue to breathe this way, feel the journey of the breath through your body and notice any places where you may be holding stress or anxiety in your body. Unfurl your brow, unclench your jaw. Let your shoulders drop down from your ears. Open your palms. And now allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm and pattern, but keep your focus on it and allow it to be your anchor during this meditation. If you get distracted by a thought or a sound, simply acknowledge that it occurred and then gently let it go and return your attention to your breath. When we're stressed or anxious about something, it's often because we don't feel we have control over it, and the sense of being out of control can make us feel less safe, and our emotions heighten. An understandable reaction to this is that we try to control the situation even further. We also tend to judge the situation and even our feelings about it. Those judgments and the stories we tell ourselves about it often become bigger than the situation itself, which adds on even more stress, and the cycle repeats. So right now, I invite you to call to mind a situation that you feel is causing you anxiety. What judgments are you holding about it? As you name the judgment, acknowledge its presence. Now give the judgment permission to drop away. You don't need it anymore. Let it go. And what's the story you've been telling yourself about the situation? As you recognize it, acknowledge its presence and give that story permission to drop away as well. You may notice your mind pushing you even harder to hold onto those judgments or those stories. Recognize and acknowledge those thoughts too, and now allow them to drop away as well. Continue to use your breath to anchor yourself back in the present moment if you get distracted. Now let's look at that situation again without the judgment or the story you were telling yourself. How does it feel different? Has the level of anxiety or stress changed? Instead, I invite you to look at the situation with total curiosity. Now, as we move into the silent part of the meditation, give yourself permission to open up to the clarity and direction on what the very next step for you to take is. Not the next five or 10 steps, not all the steps to the end, just the very next step. And continue breathing with your eyes closed. Just let your attention start to focus back on my voice. Our judgments of and stories we tell ourselves about a situation tend to exaggerate our feelings of unease, anxiety and stress. They can skew what's actually going on out of proportion and they can block us from seeing the truth of the situation and allowing in the ease and comfort we so desire. So the next time you're feeling anxious, remember to breathe and then notice and acknowledge the judgements about it and the story behind it. And then let them drop away and notice how the anxiousness eases. Focus on the truth of the situation in this moment. You have everything you need right now. Now let's take three more deep breaths together. Take a deep inhale in, holding that breath for a beat and exhale it out. Again, an even deeper breath than the one before, feeling it weave in and out of your muscles and cells and exhale it out. Last time, your deepest breath yet sending that oxygen all the way through your entire body. And when it reaches the top of your head and you're ready, you can open your eyes. Thanks for joining me for this meditation and for giving yourself this gift. Have a great rest of your day.
0 this is a meditation on depression it is not meant to fight against depression or hide from it but to sit with it and learn to develop a relationship with these feelings there are many dark and painful feelings you may be experiencing right now it may be that elusive feeling of hopelessness that seems to permeate your thoughts and maybe a feeling of meaninglessness without motivation or purpose it may just be an unexplainable sadness the Sun rises and sets and the days go on but you feel stuck lost trapped in a dark pit depression can feel like a black ink that soaks through your consciousness but there is hope there is always a tiny sliver of light that is waiting in the distance to take you back even if it may not feel that way in the moment or even if it hasn't felt that way for quite some time although you may feel yourself return only in small slow increments this meditation is intended to take you on a journey back to your life back to inner stillness and peace finding a light within the darkness so let's begin allow yourself to sit or lay comfortably with your hands resting gently at your sides or on your legs you may choose to gently shut your eyes or keep them softly focused until they become so heavy that you can no longer hold them open as you get yourself comfortable in these first few moments allow your attention to draw itself to your breathing begin taking slow deep breaths in through your nostrils and start to think to yourself simply in out but every breath in and out and if it feels good to you every once in a while take an extra deep breath and just hold it for a second then slowly exhale in a long comforting release and just fill yourself otherwise breathe naturally as you begin to settle in we'll start by counting down from five and with each number just take a slow healing breath and think to yourself the short phrase focused and relaxed so begin now with breath in five and exhale focused and relax four focused and relaxed your breathing changes during this it's perfectly fine three focused and relaxed two focused and relaxed and one focused and relaxed just let a feeling of peacefulness wash over you your head may be becoming heavy your eyes may push too close if they have not already every muscle relaxing your body sinking deep deep into the surface just continue to keep a gentle and steady breath notice notice now your entire body let me feel a slight tingling in your arms or hands or legs you may even get a sensation of the blood flowing throughout your body or notice your heartbeat you may also notice yourself within your surrounding space or even begin to feel yourself slowly connecting with it almost becoming one instead of a separate entity with everything around you now we will count down once again and this time begin to just imagine a a bright healing light in front of you even golfing you and surrounding you and with each breath just think that phrase healing light and see it now five healing light and end for healing light and specializing see it clearly feel it around you 3 healing light so vivid to healing light healing every nerve in your body and one healing light now as you further draw attention to your body and your relationship with all that's around you just bring awareness to the very top of your head and as you take another calming breath allow a sensation of relaxing energy to flow down your head down your head and through your neck and your shoulders maybe just a slight tingling sensation we also enjoy a pleasant sensation behind your eyes I'm just allowing a soothing weight to push down on them as your head gains that feeling of heaviness feel that tingling wave move slowly down your arms through your elbows and wrists and out the very tips of your fingers continuing to breathe slowly and calmly feel it creep back up and then down to your chest slowly down your door so gently breathing and finally ever so slowly down your legs down your legs and out the tips of your toes peeling that warm calming energy just flowing throughout your body and on these next breaths just pretend that you're standing elsewhere in the room watching your own body within the space and see yourself and visualize it and imagine that you see a warm glowing lights around you now on the next several breaths you will feel that heavy pressure of weight come down on you more and more enjoy this feeling this heavy feeling as you take a breath in can count with me five and out heavy weight heavy weight and for heavyweight throughout your whole body three heavyweight each breath in makes you feel heavier weighed down to each sound of my voice makes you feel heavier sinking sinking deep into the surface and one heavy weight this continue to bring focus to your breath and to my words feeling that heaviness pulling your downward into the floor your muscles just relax and give into it all down down down and as you reach the fullness of this weight take just one minute to soak in this heavy feeling concentrate on that warm glow and give yourself into the words that follow just relax for one minute what your mind creates is not you this depression is feelings it it's not you it has you in its grasp your suffering is real but hopelessness is not real the pain that you're running from and running from is real but the prison bars that you feel trapped behind are not real can you overcome this nightmare can you wake up find your way out of this dark pit from this lonely isolated place that you find yourself in you can and you will and you will wait and practice and hang on to hope because it is there for the taking it is not lost you can escape and you will keep imagining yourself in this warm glow but imagine imagine it change in hue it's a vibrant red around you and then slowly slowly that becomes a bright blue a bright glowing blue and the energy it begins flowing through you as you notice every nerve every limb every part of your body is one within this space energy warm blue glow of light flowing through you and now lastly as I count you will feel this weight slowly and gently begin to lift five you may suddenly see and visualize the vastness and openness of the sky in space for even beginning to levitate becoming lighter and lighter your arms become feathers and you throw off the heavy anvils a surface below you disappears three you see yourself no longer bound by gravity or this room breathing in and out as that glow brightens and it turns into an almost blinding white to lighter and lighter fearless alive free lighter and lighter floating floating up into the vastness of the universe and with one more revitalizing breath I count you to one weightless floating here in the vastness of space and time allow yourself two more minutes just two more minutes to float in this open world within your mind and allow yourself to search for these answers that you so desperately know are within you give yourself just two minutes healing is not instant wounds take time to heal but believe in your healing believe in your meaning and purpose you are still you you are still alive you are here you are okay you are okay this concludes our meditation so please return whenever you are lost and whenever you are ready
0 - Hi, I'm Anisa Benitez, and we'll be doing a guided meditation to reduce anxiety, so find yourself a comfortable seated position, and we'll get started. Bringing your hands to your kneecaps or your lap and taking the first deep breath, in through our nose, (inhales) and out through our mouth, closing our eyes. Again, follow your breath, taking a deep inhale through your nose, and out through your mouth. (gentle ambient music) Follow your breath, taking another deep inhale through your nose, and exhaling through your mouth. And observe the breath. Sometimes we notice that our breathing is not as deep as we thought it was. We might be breathing shallow breaths throughout the day. So how can you take more notice of what it feels like right now, to be breathing as deeply as you are? Now we're gonna hold our breath for a beat at the top. Taking a deep inhale through our nose, inhaling one, two, three, four, holding our breath, one, two, three, four, and exhaling one, two, three, four. Again, inhale through your nose, one, two, three, four, hold that breath, one, two, three, four, and release one, two, three, four. Allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and see how it feels now that you're breathing deeply at the top of your head. Bring your awareness and your attention to the top of your head. If there's tension in your forehead, how can you take a deep breath in and out and feel tension release there? Sometimes you might be holding tension because of concern or worry. Scrunching our forehead to send some breath and awareness there. Take another deep inhale and continue to bring your awareness down your body as we do this progressive relaxation technique known as body scanning. Bringing our awareness now to our cheeks. Maybe it was a day of smiling, a day of talking a lot. How can you bring your attention there and release any tension that might be there in your jawline? Continuing to follow your breath, taking a deep inhale in and exhaling. Bring your awareness down from your jaw to your throat. How can you send a deep breath there? And upon exhaling, feel the tension release from your throat. Maybe there is words unsaid that you might be holding in from the day. How can you feel that tension relax there in your throat? Continuing to make your awareness graze down your body, and while it does so, releasing any tension, stress that we might be carrying in our body. Now in our shoulders, it's so common that we hike up our shoulders. Maybe 'cause of cold, maybe 'cause of tenseness. How can you send a deep breath there and feel your shoulders release and come down? Feel your neck elongate. Continuing to bring your attention down your body, down your spine to your sitz bones, and send a deep breath there. Oftentimes, focusing at the base of our body helps us feel grounded. So take a deep inhale through your nose, and exhale, sending a big breath there. Feeling the tension release, feeling ourselves sink into the earth, feeling ourselves grounded in this moment. Continuing to bring our awareness down our thighs, down our calves, into our ankles, to her toes, to our feet in contact with the floor maybe, and send a deep breath there. Really feeling yourself grounded in this moment. In this moment. Again, take a deep inhale through your nose, the deepest that you've taken all day, and releasing the deepest exhale of all day. And when you're ready, bring your attention back to your surroundings, away from your breath, but know that you can always come back here. Open your eyes. And thank you for taking the time to tune into yourself, to tune into your breath, to feel grounded in this moment. I'm Anisa Benitez, and I appreciate you.

relaxed awareness take a moment to slowly scan your entire body allow your awareness to move over each part of your body noticing any areas that if possible can be softened and released of tension begin this loving scan at the top of your head let go of any expectations of what you think you might sense and simply feel what is truly there as you continue to notice the sensations around your head your face throat and neck try to connect directly to what you are feeling rather than using your eyes to scan the body or labeling specific sensations sense the feelings from within your body do you feel tingling heat tightness tension or relaxation you might feel a sensation of floating or lightness or heaviness whatever you're feeling is okay simply observe the sensations you may find that simply paying attention to a specific body part allows it to relax and let go as you scan begin to use your minds awareness to ask for relaxation throughout your entire body continue moving the scan of your body down all the way to your feet and stay with the sensations and this relaxation process as you slowly scan your body fully notice any areas that may still be holding on to any lingering tension and ask your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe and supported notice any areas that may still be holding on to any lingering tension and once more ask your body to let go let go of the need to be in control see the tension melting away leaving your body and going down into the surface below you to be gone from your body forever as you take time now to relax I'd like you to recall a specific powerful and positive experience you have had in the recent past an experience that has had great meaning for you in which you felt confident once you have recalled the specific event I invite you to see yourself in that experience now there may have been some very important lessons that you learned from that experience take a moment to explore in great depth this experience and in particular how you were feeling [Music] now consider how are you going to use this learning experience in the future this important learning will be available to you in the future at the exact moment you need it when you have completed that process and feel comfortable about the lessons you've learned I invite you to return your attention to the sound of my voice as we begin to use positive affirmations to support you on your journey of stress relief and confidence-building I will say each affirmation one time for you to hear then I will leave a moment for you to repeat them again on your own as you say each affirmation I invite you to imagine that it is already true for you feel the

0 I will be guiding you to be an observer of where you are in this present moment to slow down and go within to be curious about your physical sensations as well as your emotional well-being oftentimes all it takes is stepping back from a situation where the habit is reaction so you can simply be aware of a moment and respond more in alignment with your true self and what is important to you you can see the present moment for what it is and Trust the journey I invite you to make yourself comfortable and find a posture of effortless ease where you can be relaxed yet alert you may choose to lie down or sit up when you are comfortable close your eyes or soften your gaze to bring your attention inward as you settle into comfort bring your attention to your breath in a moment I will guide you to take several deep breaths counting your inhale and making your exhale one count longer than your inhale before you do this first observe the quality of the state you are in without making any changes or judging where you are just check in are you calm what is your heart rate like in this moment what is the depth of your natural breath what are the sensations you are experiencing in your body are you warm or cool what else is your attention drawn to as an observer of your state after noticing your current state begin to mindfully inhale and count the length of this breath then extend your exhale one count longer than your inhale and practice this for the next few moments let go of this counting breath and allow your breathing to return to its natural pace and then scan your body once more what is there for you now are there any differences in the quality of your state your heart rate or the sensations in your body now look for anywhere that you can let go of the tendency to hold on is there anywhere in your physical body that you can let go or any emotions that you are holding on to let them go to let go of tension let go of tightness or pain let go of the need to control or hold your posture often we are in fight-or-flight mode or under physical or emotional stress and we aren't even aware of it today right now I invite you to find more ease can you let go of stress and welcome yourself into the rest and digest mode what would it feel like in your body to experience peace to find calm to be still breathe this in experience this right now the stillness this calm state is a time to go within much like winter is a time of unseen growth a time of presumed dormant life or inactivity trust your journey Trust the journey of the seasons winter is a time to turn inward to connect with yourself to be curious about what is there for you you may sense the need to slow down to lower the intensity to rest and prepare for what is to come listen to your body to your instincts what is there for you right now the symbolism of winter invites us to quiet the mind it invites us to wrap up in warmth and find stillness of our soul to seek out serenity this is a time of introversion contemplation and going within see the still state of the life in this season and trust that there will be growth once more see the blessing in the quiet and calm of the winter see the hope for the future of the seasons to come as you look inward what is there for you right now life nature and every person experiences a natural ebb and flow an inhalation period as well as an exhalation period life is the balance of giving and receiving of expending energy and conserving energy during the winter season it is a time to withdraw conserve and rest the expenditure of energy is minimal this is the season that we experienced the longest day of the year and then the return of the light and the lengthening of daylight it is the season during which our energies are naturally drawn inward when we are inclined to be more contemplative give yourself permission to slow down to dream to go within your dreams may be blurry and not fully formed right now plant the seeds of intention for your dreams then open your field of awareness and look for signs look for your dreams to solidify in time be open to the possibilities as they arise as you take your winter season to rest and go inward invite yourself to dream dream of the person you would like to be dream of the qualities you would like to embody dream of your intentions dream of your ideal life letting your imagination run wild with all your senses as if your dream came true in this present moment feel it in your body as if it were true you may see this dream this ideal life in your mind or simply experience the energy of this dream what is coming up for you now breathe this in now plant the seeds for this life now out of these intentions and dreams will come beauty in the seasons ahead out of the stillness and peace will come a balance of energy an exhalation period be patient and listen to what your body is telling you now listen to what your soul needs now [Music] sit with these dreams and intentions for a few minutes longer feel that they are there within you preparing for the future even in this time of stillness take in another deep breath as you bring your awareness to the sensations of your body and the energy of your surroundings since the energy building within you once more knowing that out of this time of stillness comes growth you have taken this time to go inward to dream to solidify your intentions when you are ready open your eyes open to the possibilities of what these intentions will bring open your field of awareness now trust the journey listen observe and be patient look for the seasons to change the energy to shift trust the journey [Music] the love and light and me honors the love and light in you
0 - Howdy pal, and welcome to Yoga with Adriene. I'm Adriene and today we have a meditation for you to help you with anxiety. Happens to the best of us. It can get out of control fast. So, thank you for joining me in this meditation to help quell and soften and maybe even cure you from regular anxiety attacks. Hope into something comfy and let's get started. (gentle music) Alright, my sweet friends, so we're going to begin by finding a comfortable seat and what was a comfortable seat yesterday or where you may end up years from now in your meditation practice or just in your body is just always right in a constant state of flux for so many reasons. So, I'd like to invite you today to really consider what's gonna feel best. If it's leaning up against a wall, snuggle up against a wall. If it's sitting on the edge of your couch or participating in a chair, fabulous. Or you can lie down, you can practice this meditation lying down. So, we definitely wanna come to a place where we feel comfortable and safe to do this brief meditation and to practice the breath, the pranayama, and so today, just an extra gentle nudge to find a comfortable seat and really be honest about that. So, if it's not Sukhasana today, find something that feels supportive and good. For those coming into Sukhasana, you can even play with the legs here, one foot in front of the other, maybe give yourself a nice wide base. So, we'll all come into a position that we feel is the most supportive of us today. Again, it can be lying down. And when you arrive there, really choose to arrive by acknowledging, oh I chose to turn on this video, I made the choice to tend to what's going on, and the first position that I'm even taking here was also a choice to feel supported and comfortable. So, basically we're shifting gears a little bit from a mindset that might feel a little bit anxious or off, and we're starting to get organized in the brain and body and say, okay, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, I have some power here, a lotta power to help guide myself out of that which doesn't feel good and to help guide myself to a place that feels more supported. So, hopefully by now, you found your seat for today, whatever it may be, your place where you are going to reside, and when you arrive there, you can use the sound of my voice now as a guide, so close your eyes and just bring some awareness to your chest, your heart space, and depending on where you're at today, my sweet friend, you might already start to lean in and just feel what's comin' up, let the emotional body have a seat at the table and just notice. And wherever you are today, see if you can begin to do just that, notice. Come into the role of the observer. So, I find it very helpful to close the eyes, relax the shoulders, and bring your awareness to your heart center or your chest area and just allow whatever feelings come up, whatever thoughts, just notice them. And then notice where you might be holding or gripping in the body, the fingers or the toes, the ankles or the wrists, and see if you can use this idea of the observer to just notice all of those points and then in time to allow just the noticing to bring a softness, an awareness. So, your only real job here in this practice today is to pay attention. We use Pranayama technique to help guide the energy of the body and to hopefully help relieve you from feelings that are not serving, if you feel stuck or off or anxious, stressed out. Hopefully, the Pranayama will allow us to just shift our perspective or break the pattern that we might be stuck in. So, after you've taken a couple moments to just arrive here and settle in, acknowledge that you chose this, start to notice your breath. You don't have to do anything, just acknowledge it, notice the natural ebb and flow. Notice what it feels like as you breathe in and notice what it feels like as you empty the breath out. And then again, bring your awareness to your chest again, your heart space, this place that tends to get really tight and collapsed when we feel anxiety, and see if you can start to lift up through that area, even if it's not a big muscular movement but just a little energy. Then allow that to affect your breath, maybe taking a more fuller inhale, feeling the heart lift a little, then perhaps feeling the shoulders relax and soften as you breathe out. So, the neck and shoulders also get a lot of tension, a little tightness when we feel anxious, so use your inhale to feel expansion, and as you start to deepen the breath, use your exhale to find a softness, a surrender. Alright, you're doing great. Stay with it, stick with it, eyes closed, shoulders relaxed, lots of awareness around your heart center, your chest, your sternum. On your next inhale, see if you can bring the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth now, just right behind the teeth, and breathe in, and then breathe out, jaw nice and soft. Again, the tip of the tongue comes to the roof of the mouth and we breathe in. The jaw stays soft, not clinched, as you breathe out. And on your next inhale, we're gonna count to four. Breathe in for four. Here we go. Tongue comes to the roof of the mouth. And we inhale, one, two, three, four, and then just let it go soft and easy. Inhale for four, one, two, three, four, and then let it go. Notice how you feel, stay present, keep observing. Adding onto this ratio, now we're going to hold the breath, retain the breath in between the inhalation and the exhalations for a seven count. So, we'll do one breath cycle, just in and out, and then we'll start with the four. So, breathe in deep here, nice, soft, easy breath. And exhale just to relax the shoulders, empty everything out. I'm breathing in for four. Inhale, one, two, three, four, holding, retaining the breath for seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, and let everything go. Notice what thoughts come up, stay present, let it unfold. Try to keep the body still. And the last bit of the ratio is an exhale for eight. So, we'll inhale for four, I'll guide you with my voice. We'll hold at the top, retaining the breath mindfully for seven and then a nice smooth exhalation on the eight. Four, seven, eight. Soften through your fingertips and toes. One breath cycle, in and out to start, and then we'll begin. Here we go, inhale. Empty it all out. And inhaling for four, inhale, one, two, three, four. Holding for seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And exhale for eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Just notice how you did, no judgment, just observing. Inhaling for four, inhale, one, two, three, four. Retaining on seven, six, five, four, three, you got this, two, one. And big exhale, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Inhale for four, three, two, one. Retain for seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And exhale for eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one. Inhale for four, three, two, one. Retain, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Exhale for eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one. Let everything go. Stay with it. Notice what comes up. Reside in that wonderful role of the observer. And wherever you are, whether you're seated in a chair or Sukhasana or lying down, you're gonna find soft, easy movement with the neck. So, if you're lying down, you might rock the head gently side to side. You might shake the head yes and then no. And then you'll start to bat the eyelashes open. Soft, easy movement with the neck and shoulders. And then we'll take a big inhale in and exhale, sigh it out, so this is important, little big of sound here. Inhale in. Sigh it out. (sighs) And one more time, inhale. (deeply sighs) Hands come together, notice how you feel. Thank you for sharing your time and your energy and your practice with me and all the people around the globe participating, working towards a happy, healthy balanced life. Namaste. (gentle music)
0 This is a guided mindfulness  meditation on feeling overwhelmed. Take a mental step back from whatever you are feeling right now. Allow yourself to be comfortable and to take some slow and natural breaths. In and out... In and out... Feel your breath and body in your space. Recognize that for just a bit, you get to find a comforting space, here, in your time. Just you in your space... ...hearing my voice. Enjoying each moment. Enjoying your presence. Feeling okay with everything just as it is. Just for now. Again feeling so relaxed and comfortable with your body here in this space. And taking natural gentle  breaths as your focal point. We wouldn't be human if there  weren't times in our lives when our hearts and minds became overwhelmed with a weight that we are carrying. These feelings can come from many places. But it is important to know that it  is okay and natural to feel this way. What we can practice is improving a relationship  between these thoughts and emotions. And recognize a response to them. A still and calm mind can bring  us back into the present moment and to tame that heavy weight that can feel as if it reaches  all the way into our soul. That still mind can tame that voice in our head that says the pressure or pain or expectations put upon us are too much for us to handle. Practicing this mindful meditation  allows us to take a gentle step back and see the bigger picture. Just as a violent storm will eventually clear to become stillness. There is a stillness underneath. We can be reminded of the important phrase: "This, too, shall pass." And so, I invite you to focus on lifting  that weight from your mind by sharing these short phrases with me. Feel free to repeat them after me, either out loud or in your mind. Taking your time with each one and allowing the words and meaning to  sink deeply into your consciousness. And so, continuing that breath and body focus, we begin now: "I recognize stress and anxiety." "Like a heavy weight upon me." "I watch and understand it." "I allow myself to let go." "Feeling the weight lifting." "Floating away." "Floating away." "Calm and serene." "Still and present." "Right here and right now." Fantastic. That is the end of the phrases. And did you feel the weight lifting? The burden just a bit lighter on your shoulders. This may take time and may not be an instant cure, but it will help you to step outside of yourself and understand where this weight of these  overwhelmed feelings are coming from. It allows us to purposefully sort our thoughts and more clearly see a path forward. And so, enjoying this time, continuing that gentle breath  and body relaxation focus, I will just read these phrases one after another. You are invited to just listen to them and for any tension that remains, I will help you to escape it. Then I will finish up the  session, just a few minutes after. "Recognize any remaining stress and anxiety." "Like a heavy weight upon you." "Watch and understand it." "Allow yourself to let it go." "Feeling the weight lifting." "Floating away." "Floating away." "Calm and serene." "Still and present." "Right here and right now." This will soon conclude this session. And if you like, take a few last deep breaths, do some shoulder or neck circles, maybe stretch out your arms. Just prepare yourself to finish up this session and to continue on into the  next part of your day or night. Be well, be at peace, be present and mindful of your stress and anxiety. If overwhelming feelings start to overcome you, just remind yourself of how  you can let go of the weight like a helium balloon. Floating away, leaving you calm and serene. Becoming still and present, right here and right now. So long for now.
0 Hello, my loves. Welcome to a Guided Meditation by Lavendaire. I'm happy you made the choice to meditate today  and nurture your body, mind, and soul. Let's get into a comfortable seated position. Bring your hands together and take a moment for gratitude. Close your eyes. What are you grateful for in the now? No matter what you are going through, you can always find gratitude in simplicity. I am grateful for life. I'm grateful to breathe. I am grateful for this moment of peace. Release your hands back to your knees. Take a deep breath with an open mouth exhale. On your next deep inhale, bring your shoulders up, and open mouth exhale, gently bring your shoulders down. Repeat this two more times. Feel the tension and burden release with each exhale. Deep inhale, bring your shoulders up, exhale, gently bring them down. Inhale, bring your shoulders up, and exhale, gently bring them down. Take a deep breath to reset and notice how your body feels.   Now, let's release tension from the neck. Take a deep breath in and on your exhale, bring your chin down to stretch the back of your neck. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your hands behind your head. Hold here for two full breaths. On your next exhale, bring your chin to neutral and face forward.   Then breathe in and tilt your head up to stretch the front of your neck.   Hold here for two full breaths, relaxing your mouth for your exhales. Then reset and face forward on your next exhale.  Onto side neck stretches. Gently tilt your head to the right and hold there for three deep breaths. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your right hand on your head.   Reset on your third breath.   Now do the opposite side. Tilt your head slowly to the left and hold there for three deep breaths. Reset on your next exhale. Take this time to do a couple neck circles on each side. While inhaling, slowly roll your head to the right, then back. And then exhale to the left and then down. Gently, at your own pace, do one more round, inhaling for the first half and exhaling for the second half. Now switch directions. Slowly circle your neck the other way, inhaling to the left, to the back, and exhaling to the right and then back down. Repeat for one more round. When you're done, take a deep breath and open mouth exhale to reset. Notice how your body feels now. Feel the relaxation flow through your body. Now close your mouth and breathe through your nose for the rest of this meditation. We will do a full body relaxation, bringing awareness to one area at a time. First, relax your forehead. Relax your eyebrows. Relax your lips. Relax all your facial muscles. Relax your scalp. Relax your brain. Relax your shoulders. Relax your arms. Relax your hands. And relax your fingertips. Relax your heart. Relax your stomach. Relax your hips. Relax your thighs. Relax your calves. Relax your feet. Relax your toes. Feel your body totally relax. Allow yourself to feel the stillness of this moment. There is absolutely nothing you need to do other than what you're already doing right now. Just relax, breathe, and listen to this audio. Remember this feeling of calm and centeredness. You can come back to this feeling any time simply by relaxing your mind and your body, and by choosing to live in the present moment. Right here, right now. You are safe. You're safe here. Too often, we allow our minds to dwell on the past or worry about the future, causing stress and anxiety. We can't change the past and we can't predict the future. All we have control over is now. So live in the now and do the best you can in the present moment. If you think about it, the past and the future are only a figment of your imagination.   They're illusions, perceptions held by your mind. The only thing that's real is the present moment right in front of you. The present moment is always your place of power. So take a deep breath with awareness of the present moment, right now. Feel the energy you have flowing through your body right now. You are alive, you are here, and you are safe. I'd like to share some positive affirmations with you.   Feel free to recite along with me in your mind. I am enough as I am. I am exactly where I'm meant to be. Energy goes where attention flows, and my attention is here and now. I use my power in the present moment. I am guided, protected, and loved. I trust in the guidance of the universe. I allow myself to let go, trust, and enjoy life. I feel lighter and freer.   I am safe. As you continue your meditation practice, visualize your ideal image of peace. What does peace look like to you? Focus on that image and visualize it in as much detail as possible, inviting sights and sounds, and even smells. Place yourself in the scene of peace. Visualize yourself as your brightest self, feeling light and carefree in this world of serenity. Begin to bring your awareness back to your breath. Take three deep breaths with an open mouth exhale. Bring your hands together and return to your thoughts of gratitude.   Thank yourself for nourishing yourself with this meditation session. Blink your eyes open and see the beautiful world around you. Observe your surroundings with a fresh perspective and continue your day with positivity and peace. Sending you love and light. Namaste.

0 [Music] welcome to our meditation practice today's intention for our time together is to help the mind find peace and balance especially to help ourselves cope with the uncertainty of our world at this time let us begin today by finding a comfortable seated position you can sit on your bed against the wall or on a comfortable cushion if you have one let's begin by closing our eyes and taking both our hands and placing them upon our heart take a deep breath in and listen to your own heart beating in your chest what each beat may it remind you of this beautiful energy life prana that is within you with each beat may take you deeper within at this time into the internal experience of your own being take a deep breath in through your nose no long exhalation out allowing yourself to find this presence comfort and grounding within you slowly release your hands onto your lap let's take the chin hand mudra where we place the thumb and index finger together allowing the palm of the hand to face upward creating a seal of energy within your body close your eyes and allow yourself to go even deeper focusing your awareness to the space between your eyebrows your third eye simply focus and notice if you begin to see any shapes or colors or perhaps just complete emptiness and blackness no judgment here just simply observe [Music] breathing and let it go allow your body to let go of any tension in your face relaxing your forehead allowing your eyes to feel heavy and clenching your jaw complete relaxation of the face then move this relaxation downward towards your shoulders your arms and then down towards your hips and your legs just let it go simply stay present noticing the movement of your breath as you breathe in and out begin to notice any sensations in your body feeling the coolness of the air coming into your nostrils as you breathe in and then the warmth of the air leaving your nostrils as you breathe out [Music] notice if you begin to feel any tingling sensations in your fingers or your toes whatever you are experiencing right now just simply notice it be the watcher of the experience itself allow yourself to find peace enjoy in this simple moment of silence and disconnection you deserve it [Music] this is a time where it's very normal for our minds to begin to want to cling to something a specific thought a memory a daydream or perhaps even fear or the future it will go in many directions and that's okay simply remember to use your breath whenever you feel yourself drifting away from this present moment use your breath to come back to yourself to this moment right here right now wherever you are take a deep breath in and a long and soft exhale of breathing exhale out in this moment it's okay to realize that you may be feeling uncertainty stress or anxiety in your life but remember it is simply a reaction to the circumstances around you which is creating a future that has not happened yet and won't necessarily happen either even though we may not be able to control what life brings our way at this time what we do have control over is how we react to the challenges or any situations that are brought forward to us so breathe in and in this moment choose to let all that negative energy go release it out of you into the ground into the earth choose to find peace enjoy in the simplicity of this very moment simply being here with yourself giving yourself permission to feel to be to let go breathe in and exhale out [Music] as you begin to take your deep breaths I want you to see and visualize a beautiful radiant white light around you it can be crystal white or with a tint of any color that comes to you see this beautiful light of love entering your body with each breath welcome this light through the crown of your head and downward into every fiber and cell of your body visualize this radiant light healing your body in all the ways that you need healing at this moment making you stronger grounded and

0 welcome to the session where we'll be doing a self soothing practice to start settle into a physician of eve's with a straight back and wakeful posture you can imagine there is an invisible string attached to the top of your head holding you nice and tall allow your shoulders to fully rely you rest your arms where they're most comfortable close your eyes so move your breath and feel your body by that and then bring your attention to the state of your heart listening inward in a gentle compassionate way holding a space for what's here now tuned into the flow of your breath allow your mind to rest on the breath as it goes in and out of your body follow each breath attentively silently recognizing each in-breath and each other who now will relax our attention from the breath and open to a sense of self love and compassion and silently repeat the following word may I be happy may I be safe may my heart feel peace and again in your own mind repeat these phrases receiving each of them with a kind and open heart may I be happy may I be safe may my heart feel peace and one more time slowly savor each one may I be happy may I be safe may my heart feel peace you know gently returning to your bra rest in this loving comforting space you've created for yourself but your breath continuing to welcome and soothe you allow your inhales and exhales to soothe any anxiety worry weariness sadness what pain very simply very lovingly let the breath arrive on the inhale you gently flow away on the exhale now gently relax your attention while growing up many of us never had the proper tools or guidance to deal with difficult emotions we never learned to understand our sadness or anger we weren't taught how to calm our anxiety or soothe our frustration instead we learned to distract and avoid the tune out unpleasant feelings with numbing sometimes destructive behavior but no matter what happens we developed when younger in our adult lives mindfulness can help us cultivate the skills of self soothing their meditation we learn how to calm our emotions and settle our nervous system we develop self acceptance and compassion we learn to tenderly be with whatever arises rather than run from it these tools allow us to care for our own hurt so rather than seeking discomfort and distraction or destruction remember to reach for the tools of self soothing be loving and gentle with yourself and you'll be able to hold your own heart give yourself space to feel and time to breathe and become your own source of soothing comfort as Brian andreas said there are days I drop words of comfort on myself like falling leaves and remember that it is enough to be taken care of by myself and as we come to the end of the session in these last few breaths fill up your heart once again with loving kindness now let your awareness return to the room hearing sound whenever you're ready open your eyes [Music] you
0 - Hi everyone. Welcome to Yoga With Adriene. I'm Adriene and this is Benji and today we have a beautiful meditation for mental balance and grounding. So grab something to sit on if you like. Hop into something extra comfy and let's get started. (bright music) Alright, welcome my darling friends. We're going to begin, surprise, our practice today in a comfortable seat. So take your time. Just notice if you're kind of rushing right now here and let's start to slow it down as you come into a nice cross-legged seat. And I will encourage you, particularly if you're new to sitting (chuckles) in a meditation to lift your hips up either on a couch pillow or if you have a bolster, great. You can fold up some blankets or some towels are just fine too. And get to where your hips are a little bit higher than your knees so you can create these two slides of the thighs down. And as you start to get settled in here, just start to tap into that inner smile as much as you're willing. This is my power tool, my secret weapon that I often talk about so it's not so secret, but just as you settle in you can start to kind of feel the benefits of this time that you're taking for yourself by softening and, yeah, tapping into that inner smile. It can be like, "I'm doing this." Or, "Oh my god, I need this." Whatever it is just tap into a little joy that you're taking this short but valuable time for yourself. Benji's relaxed. If you're not relaxed, we'll get you there or we'll try. Hopefully by now you're in your seat. Getting settled in. And if you are working with your back right now, we'll say that, feel free to sit up against a wall or you can even do this in a chair. You just want to make sure that your spine is nice and long. And on that note, let's take a moment here to gently tuck the chin. And bring more awareness to the spine. So that could be sitting up tall. It could just be noticing your pattern. Again, just gently tucking the chin. Feeling that length as you do so through the back of the neck. And best you can bringing more awareness to your spine. And if you haven't already, allow your hands to soften, fingertips to soften just wherever feels good and then as I often invite you to do in practice same thing here. Just notice what feels good today. Whether you need a more grounding palm. Right? Energetically, I'm here. (exhales) "I'm doing this. I need to breathe. "I need this time for myself." Or maybe you're feeling pretty good and this is more preventative care today. So open those palms up baby. Allow yourself to be a little more vulnerable, open. So, both are vulnerable, but you get to decide. And really we're connecting the brain to the body here. So there's so much that goes into these little gestures and making decisions for yourself. If you know a mudra you want to take it now, please do. And then if you haven't already, close your eyes. Allow your eyelids to get heavy here. And if for whatever reason you're not comfortable with the eyelids closed, just soften your gaze gently down past your nose. (light music) Alrighty and we've begun. Chin slightly tucked. Neck long. Hands, arms, carefully placed. Fingers soft. Let's start by noticing any sounds around us. Wherever you may be today. Or maybe you're relishing, silence. As we start to settle in and ground down, allow any extra movement, patterns, just fidgeting, see if you can allow them to soften as you build a little structure for your mediation here. In time finding stillness with more ease and being kind if you're noticing a lot of fidgeting or patterns. No worries. That's why we're here. To observe. With kindness. To welcome balance and clarity to both the mental and emotional self. Now most of you have already likely begun to notice your breath but if not allow me to roll out the red carpet, to bring fresh picked flowers to your doorstep and welcome you to just notice with a loving kindness your natural breath. And as you begin to notice the rhythm of your natural breath today, see if you can take it one step further. Inviting the mind to also notice what the breath does to the body. As you breathe in and out. Notice, if you can, what parts of the body move as you breathe in. And see if you can notice how gravity tends to take over as you breathe out. So we have this sense of a rise and a fall, nice and easy, nothing forced. Just noticing what moves as you breathe in. And embracing the gravity as you breathe out. Now you can keep going just as is or I'll bring another fresh bouquet to your door and invite you to deepen the breath just a bit. Bringing more consciousness, more loving awareness to that inhale and watching the ripple effect as you breathe in. And using that exhale to ground down. Relax the shoulders. Relax your jaw. Allowing your inhale perhaps to be a little deeper, more full. And perhaps, when you're ready, allowing your exhale to be longer. Think of it as a beautiful extension. Breathing out as you ground down, down, down. Now go ahead and let your nice conscious deep breaths rest. Return to just a nice, easy, natural rhythm and flow. With so much love and a gentle, just gentleness, see if you can reestablish this awareness in your spine by maybe lifting your heart, gently sitting up a little bit taller. And you might feel, if you're doing this with your eyes closed, as though you grow a little bit longer and taller in the spine. And as you rest easy here in your seat, soften the skin of the forehead, relax the jaw and again use a gentle exhale to relax the shoulders down. You're more than halfway through your mediation. So as thoughts come to your mind, to your soul, just acknowledge them and come back to a loving awareness of your breath. So beginning to deepen the breath a little bit. Again here, see if you can find something new as you breathe in. Embracing gravity as you breathe out. And now one final invitation. As you continue to breathe and lean into the dance of feeling the inhale lift you, a rise. And feeling the exhale ground you, the fall of the breath. As you lean into that balance of the two, I lovingly invite you to just bring your mind's eye to the tip top crown of your head. Place your attention there. And then imagine, head over heart, heart over pelvis. Then from the crown tip top of your head in your own way, whatever this means to you, draw a line from the top of your head down through the center core channel of your being, all the way to the base of the spine. So we've placed a light rope or pipeline, a cylinder, whatever it is for you, this awareness from the crown of the head to the base of the spine. And see if you can allow that action, that awareness, to affect your breath or to at least notice if it changed the way your holding yourself up here with each inhale. And the way you're using your exhale to continuously ground down. And for the last minute here, we'll take that line from the crown to the base of the spine and just hang with me, my friends, continue that line down. Past your physical body, down into the earth. Continue that line down to the core of the earth. And then notice how that makes you feel. Notice if, and it may not, if that effects the way you carry yourself here, the way you breathe in and the way you breathe out. Now take three final conscious breaths. Finding balance and a sense of calm or peace between the dance of the rise and the fall. The lift and the ground. The earth and the sky. Then release your conscious breaths. Rest easy here as you slowly drop your chin to your chest. Try to keep the shoulders relaxed here as you gently open your eyes. Can flutter the eyelashes open. And when you're ready, gently lift your head. Cue the birds outside my window. We'll bring the palms together. Just take one quiet little beat here to notice how you feel. And we'll close it off by bowing together and whispering, Namaste.
0 Our own self-talk can contribute to the pain and low self-esteem that is sometimes associated with rejection or failure. This relaxation script will help you to identify the feelings and thoughts related to rejection and failure, and to change this negative thinking.  Get comfortable in a quiet place where you can relax.  Begin to relax your body by first tensing a muscle group, and then releasing to create a feeling of relaxation. Start with your arms. Close your hands into tight fists, and tense your hands and arms...all the way up to your shoulders. Hold this tension for a count of five: one...two...three...four...five. Now release, allowing your hands and arms to become limp.  Rest for a count of ten. One...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Now repeat, tensing the muscles of your hands and arms...holding very tight...very tense...one..two...three...four...five.  Relax, letting the muscles become relaxed and loose. Relax your arms even more deeply...allowing a feeling of heaviness to grow with each number...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Focus on your legs now, tensing these muscles from your hips...to your knees...to your feet. Hold the muscles of your legs very tightly...filled with tension...hold for a count of five. One...two...three...four...five.  Release this tension, allowing your legs to relax completely. Rest for a count of ten. One...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Repeat, tensing your legs again, holding very tightly...feeling the tension in each muscle...one...two...three...four...five.  Now relax, releasing the tension you have been holding in your legs. Relax completely, feeling your legs become heavier and more relaxed...relaxing even more with each number...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Tense the muscles of your back now...one...two...three...four...five...and release...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Tighten the muscles of your chest and stomach. Hold..one...two...three...four...five...and release...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Now practice holding and releasing tension with your breath. Breathe in deeply and hold that breath. Hold...feeling the tension...and then relax...breathe out...releasing all the tension with your breath. Take another breath, breathing in deeply...and hold. Now release, relaxing as you breathe out.  Allow your next breath to occur naturally...smoothly breathing in as much air as you need, and then releasing the air naturally, exhaling fully. Breathe slowly in and out...letting your breaths occur at whatever pace is comfortable for you. Feel your breathing slow naturally...becoming very calm.  (Pause)  Now that you are feeling more relaxed, think about the feelings of rejection or failure you would like to deal with.  Think about a time when you felt rejected or a time when you believe you failed in some way. When did this rejection or failure event occur? What happened? Imagine this rejection or failure event in detail, remembering as much as you can.  (Pause)  Now think about how you felt when the rejection or failure event was happening. What emotions did you experience at the time?  (Pause)  What about afterward? What emotions did you have after the rejection or failure occurred?  (Pause)  How are you feeling right now, as you think about the rejection or failure? Notice how you feel emotionally and physically in this moment.  (Pause)  Now examine the thoughts that go along with your emotions. Picture the event when you experienced rejection or failure. What kinds of things were you saying to yourself during and after?  For example, perhaps you were rejected by a friend who told you that he did not want to see you. You may have had thoughts such as:  He does not like me.  I am no good.  I am not fun to be around.  No one likes me.  I’m a loser.  These types of negative thoughts lead to the unpleasant feelings you experienced. If you want to feel better, you can change the negative thoughts to more realistic ones and your feelings will become more positive.  One way to change negative thinking is through affirmations to build confidence and increase self-esteem. Let’s work on increasing confidence now.  First, focus again on relaxing your body and calming your mind. Let all your previous thoughts go, and be only in the here and now.  (Pause)  Breathe away the thoughts, just allowing them to pass...letting each thought slip away...  You do not need to do anything in particular...just relax...and let your thoughts pass, without dwelling on any of them...  (Pause)  As you begin to relax, allow yourself to open up to the idea of feeling confident and secure...strong and positive...imagining what it would be like to experience positive feelings and believe positive things about yourself.   Imagine what it would be like to look at a situation with new eyes...with self-respect...  Imagine how you would handle rejection or failure as a self-respecting, confident person...treating yourself with respect and love...  Think about the idea of accepting imperfection...of allowing mistakes and learning from them...think about all the true, realistic things you could tell yourself if you experience rejection or failure.  Instead of saying, “he does not like me" or “no one likes me," you can tell yourself the following types of statements:  I cannot read people’s minds. The thing that happened does not necessarily mean that he does not like me. There are people who care about me. I care about me.  Instead of saying, “I am no good," you may say:  I made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. I do not like making mistakes, but I can learn from my errors. I choose to learn from this experience. I have many good qualities and I also have flaws.  Think about the more positive, more realistic, encouraging statements you could say to yourself about the situation where rejection or failure occurred.  (Pause)  It is normal to experience rejection sometimes. You are a human being and all human beings go through rejection.  Remind yourself that you are a good person.  It is okay to feel upset. Know that these feelings will pass. You will soon feel better.  Be kind to yourself. The most painful rejection is the act of treating yourself unkindly. Be a support to yourself.  (Pause)  You are a human being with both strengths and weaknesses. It is okay to have flaws. You, like all people, will make many mistakes in your life. Errors are part of being human.  We all fail from time to time. Failing at one thing does not make you a failure and it does not generalize to you as a person. A failure at one thing can be better described as a mistake, rather than a failure.  Failing at many things, that is, making many mistakes, is a healthy, normal process. Successful people fail many times. You are a successful person.  Mistakes can be turned into positives by growing from them.  (Pause)  Now you can simply relax...no need to focus on anything at all.  Just drift...relaxing...  (Pause)  Allow a feeling of confidence to begin inside...deep within your core...it may feel like warmth...such a solid, strong feeling...  Let this confidence grow...getting bigger...radiating from inside you...filling your entire body from head to feet...shining from you and lighting up the room you are in...  It feels so good to be filled with confidence.  Allow the confidence to grow...all on its own...it grows without you doing anything at all...getting bigger...even stronger...feel the confidence that fills you...  Any negativity in your life can be a trigger for this confidence to grow. Rejection or failure... upsetting events...anything negative in your life can remind you of this feeling of confidence you have right now.  When something negative happens, find that a feeling of confidence begins inside and grows...filling you with strength and poise to deal with the situation. You can feel good and feel confident even in circumstances that are less than ideal. Negative situations can be a cue for this confidence to grow.  Feel the confidence fully, right now...filling you with complete confidence and calm.  (Pause)  Keep a feeling of confidence with you as you complete this relaxation exercise. Take a few moments to re-awaken your mind and body.  Open your eyes and look around the room, becoming re-oriented to your surroundings. Stretch if you want to, and feel your body waking up.  When you are fully awake and alert, you can return to your usual activities, feeling confident and calm.
0 Take a moment to settle into a comfortable position.  Notice now, how you are feeling.... how you are doing right now in this moment.  How does your body feel? Scan your body for a moment now, starting at your feet, simply noticing how your body is feeling.  Notice your feet... ankles... legs.... hips. Continue scanning your body, moving upward to your stomach, back, chest, sides. Mentally scan your hands, arms, and shoulders... your neck, head, and face.  Where is your body the most tense? Where is your body the most relaxed?   Just notice the state of tension and relaxation in your body.  Notice how your body relaxes... bit by bit.... without any effort on your part. See how your muscles become a little bit looser... less tense.... naturally, just because you are taking a moment to sit quietly and relax. Without any effort or input from you... without you even trying... your body becoming slightly more relaxed with each passing moment.  Think about your body image... what is body image? Maybe you think about the picture in your mind you have of what your body looks like. Maybe it's the ideas you have about your body... your feelings about your physical self. Perhaps body image is is a vision of how you think your body should be. What does body image mean to you?  Take a moment now to consider your thoughts and ideas about your own body. How are you feeling right now, thinking about your body image? You might feel neutral, content, comfortable, uncomfortable, satisfied, dissatisfied, happy or unhappy, angry, afraid, accepting..... maybe a combination of things.... contradictory feelings are common.... and it is okay to feel however you are feeling.  What might it be like to accept your body, just as it is? What if you felt okay about your physical self? Imagine for a few moments what that would be like.  Think about a time in your life when you felt accepting of your physical self - your whole self, or even part of yourself.  Which parts of your body are the easiest for you to accept?  Imagine if you could accept your body as a whole, rather than as a collection of individual parts.  You have been doing some difficult thinking these last few moments. Let's take a step back now, mentally, to relax.  Breathe in, deeply. And breathe out.  In.... and out.....  In... and out.....  Keep breathing deeply, slowly. It feels good to take deep, calm breaths.  Just relax for a moment while you notice your breathing. Just notice your breaths for a moment.  (pause)  If there are any areas where you are feeling tense, direct your attention to these areas as you breathe.... imagining that each breath in brings relaxation... and each breath out expels tension. Breathing in relaxation... and breathing out tension..... each breath relaxes you further.   (pause)  Now I will say some body image affirmations. You can repeat these if you wish, or simply relax as I talk.  Each affirmation is true.... even if it may not seem true right now.  Let's begin the affirmations.  I am okay the way I am.  I can accept myself the way I am.  My body is acceptable just the way it is.  I am an okay person.  I accept this body I am in.  There is no need to be perfect.  My imperfections make me unique.  I am perfectly alright just the way I am.  My body is a functioning whole.  I am human, and all humans have flaws.  I can accept my imperfections.   I free myself from judging my body.  I am okay just the way I am.  I accept myself.  Now that you have repeated some affirmations, take note of how you are feeling. What was it like to repeat or listen to the affirmations?  It is okay to feel however you are feeling right now, good or bad. Accept the variety of feelings you may have.  Take a moment now to just relax. Let all the worries and tension go as you breathe slowly in... and out.... in.... out..... continue to breathe slowly, deeply.... naturally.  When you are ready to return to your waking level of consciousness, slowly leave this relaxed state you are in. Keep with you a feeling of calm, while becoming more awake and alert.  Wake up your body and your mind. Move your arms and legs a little and feel your muscles reawakening.  I'll count up now from 5 to 1, and when I reach 1 you will be fully awake and ready to return to your usual activities.  5  4  3  2  1

on our thoughts did you know that we have over 60,000 thoughts a day you must know with this number not all of what you think is true so what kind of thoughts led you to feel depressed or sad notice

your priority on a daily basis no matter how false they may feel at first train yourself to think positively it takes dedication and practice to overcome depression and negativity and you have the power to do it gently rise from your meditation feeling a new fresh start on life take one last deep breath and open your eyes0 hello welcome to today's gentle movement practice for relieving stress and anxiety i'm sarah raymond with the mindful movement so just a quick overview of what we're going to be doing today primarily it's going to be seated so you can be seated in a chair or on the floor even on a couch whatever is comfortable for you and then the second half will be a little bit on the floor so if you're comfortable coming down onto the floor with me you'll join me if not then you just participate in the front first half of the practice so we'll start with a little bit of breathing and then some gentle self-massage techniques to bring some awareness to different body parts when you might be feeling anxious and need a little bit of grounding and then some gentle stretches to open up the area that allows you to deepen your breath and find a little bit more ease if you are experiencing stress or anxiety so let's get right to it so come to any comfortable seated position and we'll start with a four seven eight breath so it's an inhale through your nose for four counts a hold for up to seven if you don't feel comfortable with seven then you can do a shorter hold and then it's a slow exhale through your nose for eight counts and i'll count you through the first two and then we'll practice a little bit on our own so again finding any comfortable seated posture tall lifted spine shoulders relaxed and down maybe close your eyes if you'd like and then exhale fully as a preparation breathe in two three four hold two three four five six seven breathe out two three four five six seven eight again breathe in two three four hold two three four five six seven breathe out two three four five 6 7 8 now continue on your own so finish one more cycle on your own and then allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm normal depth and flow and then next we'll take three deep inhales through the nose and this time as you exhale create an audible sigh so do that two more times let your body soften and relax with each exhale blink your eyes open if they were closed okay so next we're going to move on to as i said some self massage techniques i'll take my glasses off here so we'll start with the facial massage and you're just putting a gentle pressure doesn't have to be significant you can use your fingers or if you have a tiny little ball that might work too but you're basically finding the bones in your face and pressing on the bones and you might just press along the bones or you can press and gently pull either outward downward upward whatever feels like it's the most effective for you we're not going to spend a ton of time here you can again close your eyes if you like and go against your nose at the cheekbone above your eye eyebrow i should say above your eyebrow your forehead and then i like to spend a good bit of time right at around the jaw so it's pretty much in line with where your ear is so you can find them there's a bone on the top and a bone on the bottom and then there's a little indentation and you can press there and open and close your jaw and then go around the jaw and then you would just of course do the same on the other side and if there's any areas that feel particularly sore you might just stay there and take a few deep breaths and like we practiced earlier when your exhale is longer than your inhale it can have a little bit of a relaxing effect relaxing effect for you you'll start to find the areas that feel like you need to spend the most time there and you can always just explore there so again find the jaw hinge of the jaw open and close okay and if there's anywhere that you feel like you need to spend a little bit more time you can do that otherwise we'll move on to our neck so you can use both hands or one at a time your choice you'll feel just behind the ears the bone start there and then start to work your way down and you can even go to this upper trapezius area so the top of your neck and shoulders and then let me show you from the back you're going to take one hand on either side of your neck so on either side of your spine i should say and then think of pulling outward and as you do gently let your head drop back and then come back up again so you'll go through that a few times right starting right at the base of the skull and then working your way down and then after you do that a few times you can um i like actually do this with the opposite hand so the muscle right at the top of your shoulder you'll grab with your opposite hand squeeze up draw your shoulder up towards your ear and then just release down squeeze up and release down one more time on the side and then we can switch sides so as you squeeze that muscle lift your shoulder up and release and all the time continuing to breathe fluidly good okay and then last bit of self massage will be the area of your chest so if you can find your collarbone at the top of your chest you're going to go just below the collarbone and you'll just give a little bit of pressure you can push in and then pull down gently and as you pull down you might explore turning your head in the opposite direction so you feel a little bit of stretch through maybe the neck at least so my my left side is always a little bit tighter especially at the neck here so i know i need that and then you might go down a little bit below the collarbone if that feels okay for you and we'll do the other side so finding the collarbone right below press in and feel free to either tip your head towards the opposite shoulder or turn your head towards the opposite shoulder maybe again go down a little bit below the collarbone okay and that will be all of our self massage today so next we'll start to do some very gentle stretches so again you can remain in any comfortable seated position arms by your sides and then we'll stretch through our neck here so you can begin by tipping your right ear towards your right shoulder i'll mirror you here and as you're tipping your head to your right think about drawing your left shoulder down away from your ear and then you'll draw your chin towards your right collarbone and then you can either stay here with your chin towards your collarbone or go back to chin forward whatever feels comfortable and then take your left arm out just um above the height of your hip i would say turn your palm forward and then you're moving from your wrist so you'll draw your fingers backwards and forwards a few times be gentle here there's no need to be aggressive with these stretches and then just allow your arm to relax down draw your chin toward your chest slowly and then your head comes back up and we'll do the same on the other side so nice and gentle tip your left ear towards your left shoulder encouraging your right shoulder to stay down and then turn your chin you can see i'm moving very slowly to make sure i don't go too far too fast chin towards the left collarbone and then as we start to add the movement from the arm you can again either keep your chin down or tip it forward but you're still bringing your ear towards your shoulder and then we lift uh let's see this is your right arm out to the side just a little higher than your hip and then palm facing forward as you move from the wrist fingers go back and fingers forward and you might start to notice if you're tensing up through the neck this might be too high so bring your arm down or make the movement from your wrist a little smaller and then relax your hand down slowly draw your chin toward your chest and just letting your head hang here for a moment take a breath in and out and then slowly bringing your head back up all right and then from here a couple spine stretches so we'll lift your left arm drawing your shoulder down and think about lifting up tall and at the same time grounding down and then gently side bending over to your right and now we'll start to add some movement but i want you to try to focus on keeping your left sit bone heavy on the ground so as you turn your shoulders forward towards the floor you're not lifting that right uh the right side of your butt up and then come back to center and turn your chest towards the ceiling and center now we'll keep doing that movement you're going to bring your eyes to focus on your top hand and then we'll follow the hand so you're looking forward as your shoulders rotate forward looking back towards the ceiling and then behind you one more time rotating forward looking forward rotating back and come through center and back up again all right maybe roll your shoulders around a few times and we'll do the other side so lift your right arm again lift tall first and root down through the pelvis and then we side bend over so as i said my left side is always a little tighter so i have to remind myself to draw that shoulder down easy in the neck and then begin to rotate shoulders forward and back and now adding the eyes so looking up at your top hand rotating forward just keep that top hand as your focal point one more time forward and back and center and up again okay so um this next part if you are comfortable lying down on your back i would recommend doing that if you prefer to be seated you can definitely do this seated so i'm going to take it down onto the floor and once you lay down you're going to interlace your hands and place your hands right at the base of the head now again you could do the same exact thing as seated if you prefer now if you have any shoulder issues uh if just one shoulder is not comfortable in this position you can just do this with one hand or if neither of your shoulders are comfortable uh overhead you can use a pillow under your head is fine so we're finding this sense of almost traction so my hands are at the base of the skull where there's two little bony points and i'm gently lengthening those two bony points away from my shoulder so that my neck is nice and long and then i'll relax my arms by my side so my head's heavy neck is relaxed and then i'm actually gonna do this without my glasses with your eyes only look as far to your right as you can and you'll just allow your eyes to stay in that position so eyes are looking as far to the right as you can without moving your head and then come back to your breath and we'll stay here for a few breaths if you feel a sense of release or relaxation response like a sigh or a yawn you can bring your eyes back to center if you don't quite get there then you'll just stay for a few more breaths and then bring your eyes back to center if they're not already and just blink your eyes a couple times you may have to repossession reposition your head and neck and then we'll do the same thing to the left so you're keeping your head still and moving only your eyes looking as far to the left as possible and then once you do that you'll keep your eyes left back to your breath and then just allow your body to relax so maybe scanning through physical sensations of your body to see if there's anywhere you could soften you know i tend to grip through my hips a little bit so it's helpful to relax there [Music] or maybe you could find a little more ease in your shoulders take one more breath looking left come back to center again blink your eyes and then you can close your eyes and take your hands out from behind your head relax them by your sides and then if you are uh laying on your back just bring your knees in toward your chest you're still seated you might fold forward over your legs just in essence giving yourself a gentle hug and take a few breaths there checking in to see how you're feeling okay and then releasing your feet back down or coming back to seated and then we're going to move on to laying on our belly so you'll roll over if you're on the floor come down onto the floor if you were seated and then you're going to be propped up on your forearms so elbows under shoulders if you can if this feels like it's too much on your lower back then you can take your elbows wider and if that still feels like too much you might go still a little wider or other option would be to be all the way down okay so we do want to be working to open the chest as much as possible so again you can take nice deep breaths okay so if you're on your forearms you're pressing down into the forearm to lift the crown of your head as tall towards the ceiling as you can and then you might allow your butt muscles and your legs to relax and then start to breathe into your belly expanding side to side front to back and as you're breathing out do your best to avoid sinking down into the shoulders okay so you can stay here or we're going to add a side bend so leading with your eyes look left side bend left so that means your left shoulder will go towards your left hip and you're looking with your eyes to see how far behind you can see maybe you could see one foot maybe you can see both and then come back to center and then to the other side so eyes first then the shoulders and then the waist and center now coordinating that with your breath so you can really breathe in either either pattern but i like to inhale as i side bend and exhale back to center keep thinking about the crown of the head lifting away from the floor and then last little addition here if you're comfortable with it is to add a bend of the opposite knee so as you side bend the left you're bending your right knee and center and as you side bend right you're bending your left knee so remember eyes are leading the way we'll do one more in each direction and then come down stack one hand over the other and you can rest either your cheek or your forehead on your hand and then take a nice deep breath into your belly and let it out we'll do one more belly breath here i like to do the belly breath on the floor like this because you can feel your belly expand against the floor okay and if you're comfortable on your knees in a child's pose position you can go there so you can either have your knees apart and your big toes together with your knees together and your big toes together hips back and then chest comes down now if your knees and or hips are not happy here just roll onto your back and hug your knees into your chest a few breaths again soften and relax the body okay and then we're going to add a side bend here so taking your hands over to your left ribs over to your left and then settling into that child's pose position again you might encourage your right hip to draw back your right fingers to crawl forward and then now as you breathe send your breath into the right side of your body from the armpit down to the ribs down to the waist and then take your time coming over to the other side so again drawing now left hip back left fingers forward using your breath into the left side of your body to create expansion to increase mobility of the ribs and the muscles that assist in breathing and then come back to center and back up again okay so we are going to do one more stretch to continue to open up the rib cage area again the muscles in between the ribs help to breathe or allow for a deeper breath so you come on to your side with your knees bent so they're going to line up with your hips and then your bottom arm can go out in front and if your neck is okay with it your head can come down if you feel like you need a little bit of a support just grab a pillow or a blanket or a towel and roll it up and then we'll start to lift the top hand towards the ceiling so right up over your shoulder again use your eyes to facilitate this so you're looking at your hand just above your shoulders and then start to bring your top shoulder towards the floor and that will allow your arm to go back keep following your hand with your eyes as far as you can and then eventually maybe your arm reaches the ground and if it doesn't that's okay but if it feels like it's strain on the elbow you can bend your elbow and just rest your hand on your shoulder so more importantly is that we're twisting through the rib cage here and the chest stretch is sort of a bonus there if you do feel comfortable with your hand on the floor all right once we have arrived in our twist you're welcome to close your eyes and begin to breathe into the area that feels like it's stretching the most for you so perhaps it's the rib cage or maybe it's your hip or your inner thighs whatever you're feeling is fine just send your breath there and encourage relaxation to come to you and then take your time as you start to unwind yourself back and then we are going to turn over and do the other side so you make your way onto your second side again knees are bent out in line with your hips bottom arm out in front head comes down and then you'll lift your top arm up towards the ceiling find the hand as your focal point and then your shoulder is the first to move so as if you're trying to get that top shoulder to touch the floor behind you which first folks it won't quite get there and that's okay so once you twist as far as you can you can always bend the back elbow and put your hand on your chest if that feels more supportive or you can let your hand rest on the floor closing your eyes if you wish and taking a few deep breaths scanning through your body noticing where you feel any restriction or gripping and sending your breath there okay take your time as you untwist and then you can use your top hand to press you up to seated and then as you come to seed it again let's uh do a quick check-in so you'll close your eyes let your arms relax by your sides first notice your natural breath after spending some time in self-care you might notice your emotional state after this short practice to help reset your nervous system and decrease stress and anxiety you might check in with your physical state notice the muscles around your eyes your jaw your neck see if there's a little bit more softening available softening the outer layer connect with this calm peaceful feeling know that is always within you within reach when you're ready gently blinking your eyes open so any of that can be separated out and used on its own so the four seven eight breath pattern the self massage techniques or any of the stretches to be used to help calm you down bring you you know back into your body if you're feeling uh moments of stress or anxiety and additionally i'll share with you a playlist of all of our meditation practices for anxiety so that you can pull one up whenever you need it i hope you have a peaceful and calm day remember come back

0 take a load off right now set yourself down and relax as best you can in this moment to fully appreciate what your mind is capable of changing [Music] through visualizing the sights sounds smells and feelings described you can alter how your mind perceives any anxious thoughts and sensations it may take some time and patience to see results but with perseverance in listening to this soothing meditation track on a regular basis your subconscious will realize that those situations that bring high energy and nervousness can be alleviated [Music] please make this time for yourself by setting aside an area where you can fully absorb this experience safely being comfortable and reassured that only good things will come take a moment to set the volume of this audio to a setting where you won't have to move and is not too loud to appreciate any lighting the need adjusting to create a calmer atmosphere and taking care of any otherwise distracting elements can be done there [Music] now is it time to be gentle with yourself you owe it to yourself your mind and body when tension builds and can be felt it can cause a chain reaction a snowball effect anxious feelings of a stirring and somersaulting stomach can lead to tension in the shoulders and other areas this then can lead to negative way of thinking and so the vicious cycle of these effects continue to drown out any positive vibes that you should be experiencing over time the confusion of what causes all these sensations and downward where your thinking gets a little fuzzy and trying to understand why you feel the way you do becomes lost [Music] as this meditation continues and you absorb yourself more you will begin to open up seeing understanding and realizing that perhaps you have become too hard on yourself [Music] there are a few possibilities of my anxiety sneaks up when you least expect it this can be from being too strong for too long guilt from the past or simply being in new circumstances there are many many more these are just examples you know help this quiet time to let thoughts feelings and sensations be shown in a safe and calm way where you are fully in control in a moment let the imaginative side of your mind take over as you begin to relax underneath your subconscious will be making notes readjusting things and compensating you with a more positive way of thinking gifting you with a karma mood whilst deeply relaxing your body [Music] now as she lays still and relaxed as best you can let your imagination begin to take over see in front of you a corridor and at the end of just a few steps forward is light take a break from your mind right now forwards and away from yourself into the light [Music] the dark corridor can be seen as the confusion that surrounds the mystery of your anxious feelings and where the light is projected from will perhaps provide you with answers to take back with you when you do return you can give yourself permission to bring back as much of this experience as you wish [Music] in the distance you see blues yellows and greens mixed in with a subtle warm overturn the shapes you see are moving slowly or very easy on your eyes as you get closer everything becomes clearer as you now see a beautiful fine sandy beach that soaks up the warm daytime Sun [Music] palm trees gently sway at the edge of this beach oasis whilst creating a soothing white noise has the leaves dancing the comforting breeze the sight of an aqua and blue ocean washes the smallest white waves as they spill onto the salt and sand which glistens like diamonds in the Sun the breeze is warm as it gently strokes the calm midday Sun onto your face and body relaxing you slightly [Music] as you walk from the shadows of the corridor onto this blissful Beach you fill your shoulders instantly relax and your face soften as if synchronizing with this calm atmosphere feeling the soothing effects of this oasis you turn and close the door to the corridor leaving guilt tension and worry behind [Music] the flourish of seagulls above you floating and gliding on past looking up you follow with your eyes as they slowly fade away mix in with the very blue sky above as if dissolving into the horizon [Music] the cells around you orchestrate calmness peace and tranquility the more you observe the more you may feel the warmth somewhere in your body possibly a real jewel chest area of relief and contentedness [Music] let your worries just dissolve now as you fully absorb yourself and become one with this atmosphere of bliss nothing matters and nobody needs your attention right now let yourself be free and present appreciating every positive aspect of peace that you are surrounded by [Music] as you walk toward the gentle rhythm of the spinning waves that stroke the sand your feet feel warm massaged with every step that you take [Music] noticing your feet and toes relax a little your breathing becomes easier and worried and tension is left behind [Music] [Music] you will now the person you know to be one that is calm filled with peace and content leaving all outside distractions you begin to uncover your true self your mind has been playing up to the situation's you have been around as if slipping in thoughts that are misplaced by sleight of hand now knowing that in some part that those feelings are but an illusion by changing your mindset and focusing on more positive ideas and images those thoughts and sensations just dispersed [Music] very much like doing something you know will take a lot of time energy and hard work you have to change the way your mind focuses [Music] in front you see a beautiful scene of sand sea and wolf filling your mind with such an image as a positive effect which transcends to your body in relaxation as you walk closer to the water's edge you feel the very relaxing fine sand under and around your feet with every step your mind drifts off more creating more clear thinking to focus on this presence travel moment [Music] as your feet pressed down on the sand weather calm waves cycle back and forth the warm water glides over your ankles instantly taking away any leftover attention in all areas of your body [Music] every muscle is now fully relaxed softer and resting gently as you are hypnotically massaged by every soft spill of warm white water [Music] looking outwards you notice the blue ocean glistening as a million ripples shimmer in the daytime Sun [Music] on the sand are a few pebbles within reach they are round and smooth laying under the water you pick up three of them and look help to see again you wonder how well these pebbles were skinned on the calm surface of the warm water [Music] as you slowly pull your arm back with the first pebble you place a thought that you would like to go with the stone [Music] when you already the pebble and thought go as one across the air [Music] smoothly skimming the top of the water eventually making a satisfying plunk as they drift to the ocean floor [Music] as the pebble and food disappear from sight you feel slightly more clear-minded relaxed and a piece [Music] with your mind now being more serene you begin to notice more around you where you have been standing soaking up the gentle white water wash you can see small golden fish have been swimming nearby in this clear blue sea crabs tickling the water with their pincers and a reflection of the water when your legs are another indication of how relaxed you are feeling right now [Music] when you think more clearly and more positively things around you can be seen more obviously it only takes a shift in focus and perception to realize this now these may only be small things to notice but they help to create a fuller picture outside in life this can also be practiced where there may be stressful or anxious situations a shift in focus can change how you feel and more importantly help you follow through of a more positive outcome the more this is practiced consciously the easier it will become and the stronger more calm you will be in these situations [Music] walking along the shore at the water's edge brings a sense of freedom as you look around at the beauty that surrounds you from the lull of each wave you step through the untouched blue sky to the endless horizon you see beyond you relax more becoming happier inside and more carefree [Music] having this time to let things settle down is an important step towards bringing peace to yourself wandering along the shore a sea plane slides along the horizon and training behind his aband which reads relax and let go [Music] the plane is a reminder of the busy thoughts that once occupied your mind as it slowly flies past at a distance being so far away you are safe remaining calm and balanced it fits quite nicely into this blissful setting with its hum whispering in the background gentle waves and brushing palm trees also have a calming effect you can incorporate this into the outside world by creating a balance that works for you where you remain fully in control [Music] it all begins with noticing your body as soon as you sense any tension or different thought pattern that brings about these feelings you can adjust how you react to them you are always in control [Music] filling yourself with positive feelings and even thinking about this tranquil place that you are in right now can help maintain and ease those worries away as time goes by this process will become quicker and easier also the more you notice these slight differences quicker you'll be able to adjust and regain a more comfortable state of mind [Music] sometimes it's not a question of how relaxed you are feeling but of how aware of your mind and body you are having this urge of knowing what is going on being present can help in situations with focus and balance is needed [Music] as you continue along the coast your feet are wash with the warm salty sea fill pleasantly relaxed with each unwed step your shoulders and top of your arms relax down as you stare out to sea noticing more along the way [Music] as the beach curves around much like a Cove you faintly see wisps of smoke from a small campfire burning in the distance with the Sun now setting with its orange glow you can hurriedly walk around the shore making your way over to the somewhat mysterious settlement [Music] the Sun sets over the ocean bringing with it the sky of reds purples and orange [Music] still very warm the colors bring a visual representation without feeling to your eyes [Music] the once shimmering service of the ocean was over white and blue as the Sun slowly sets downwards it has become a blanket of warm red and orange sparkles [Music] the sand that was once bright yellow is now of an orange rather looking like it is encrusted with diamonds as it shimmers below the setting sky the shadows of everything all now long bold as though leaning away from that orange horizon like the hands of a clock counting down the Sun [Music] the campfire is now in sight and the warm scent of wood burning can now be appreciated a weld the fire is furred water and a soft mattress bed underneath a large umbrella [Music] as you walk closer a sign that has been placed in the sand bears your name and below is a letter for you to read you reach down picking up the letter and see that this comfortable camp has been made up for you [Music] there is no name on the letter but all it says is that this is a thank you for taking the time to notice this beautiful place and being aware of your feelings [Music] feeling quite accomplished in your findings you humbly place the letter back and walk over to the food and water the Lok Fire gently bellows away generating enough heat to keep you born as you tuck into the food that has been left for you [Music] certain warm fine sound as you finish your meal you see the Sun has now set and the stars have been revealed in the night sky you could not imagine a more blissful place being more calm than what it has been but the night time brings a special quietness to everything the sky is now of a dark blue and black the ocean a cream and purple [Music] the breeze is no longer as the clear light sky extends its reach over the horizon the Stars now shine brightly and the moon is clear to see giving a subtle light to every edge [Music] as you look up you observe the craters on the moon surface on a bed of gentle ripples the sound from the shore your eye is now feeling heavy from relief and contentedness you take a few sandy steps to the thick soft mattress that lay upon the beach pulling back the blanket you clamber in and sink down deep into its hugging material your head slowly descends into the pillow as you feel all your energy let go [Music] looking into the very warm lock fire the flames magnetized your stare the boys you'd look through the flames the heavier your eyes become feeling reassured safe and at peace [Music] the blanket mattress and pillow softly beckon your muscles to relax with each deep and gentle breath that you take [Music] as you lay there quiet calm and relaxed your boys close one more time [Music] the sounds of the ocean the fire and your breathing hypnotically deep in your world and lead for sleep [Music] now knowing more than what you did before you came here brings relief that you can come back at any time taking with you all and everything you have seen heard and felt you now know you can use this experience to benefit you in the outside world [Music] with every deep breath and relaxed muscle comes a certainty but you are stronger than what you think you are you can harness the calm inside yourself at any time [Music] you will go through situations with a level head balance and remain fully in control at all times [Music] rest now relax more into this comfortable place let this calmness rest your mind and body to help you awake were first in a positive mood that will last

safe and comfortable state of relaxation imagine that you are standing at the top of a beautiful white marble staircase see the staircase and vivid detail rest your hand on the smooth cool marble banister that runs down alongside the staircase as you look down the stairs you notice that there are ten steps leading down these are the steps that will lead you deeper into relaxation in a moment as I begin to count you will walk down these steps you will find that the deeper down you go the more comfortable and the more relaxed you will become so now you can hold on to the beautiful banister and begin to slowly safely descend on the stairs as I count ten you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do so that you can focus on yourself 8 you allow your body and mind to completely relax and you allow the outside world to be tuned out 7 this step takes you even deeper into a relaxed state 6 you are committed to moving your life and dreams to the next level 5 as you descend you feel the familiar state of freedom in your body and clarity in your mind it comes with this relaxation for going deeper and deeper into comfort as you relax further you see a light at the bottom of the stairs 3 almost to the bottom of the staircase almost to the light shining up at you two you continue deep deep into relaxation and one all the way into your deepest state of relaxation where you arrive at the bottom of the staircase and now that you have reached the bottom of the beautiful staircase you are completely relaxed and comfortable take a moment to look at your surroundings in this dream state here you can see more clearly now that the light you see is shining out from behind a partially closed door at the bottom of the staircase this light is seeping out from the edges of the door expanding its light outward yet being partially blocked by the door you have a sense that behind this door lies all that you are capable of and all of your inner potential this light is shining out only a little bit allowing only some of your potential to be seen the door is essentially blocking the light of your potential to be fully seen you know that before this door can be opened all the way there are things that you must let go of there are blocks that must be removed recognizing that there are blocks that need to be let go of is the first step take a moment and first let go of any negativity you may be holding on to this negativity doesn't have to be named specifically just let it go let the energy of negativity go let the weight of limiting beliefs go see these beliefs floating away like a feather being blown by the wind only to be replaced with new positive beliefs these limitations we put on ourselves can be holding us back from moving forwards towards our ideal life and towards contentment let it all go let go of any expectations you have of yourself and let go of any expectations you believe others have for you let go of the need to please anyone but you and [Music] let go of the tendency to care what others think let go of attachments let it all go let go of competition with past versions of yourself and with others let go of the idea of being perfect and the need to always be right let go of the times when you find yourself thinking you should be saying or doing something in your life let it all go let go of excuses let go of judgmental thoughts let go of jealousy and thoughts of not enough let go of insecurities let it all go let go of the past in order to move forward let go of worries of the future let go of fear let go of grudges and forgive allow the past to be the past and not create your future path and let go of anything else that is no longer serving you be here now be present be mindful be grateful be full of joy and be loved once all of these ideas thoughts and blocks have been released begin to replace them with positive thoughts and energy you can now replace these thoughts with the simple and powerful idea that you are enough you are enough a deep inner confidence and sense of peace is had when you believe deep down that you are enough hear the words feel them in your heart let them sink into your subconscious beliefs you are enough you are enough you are enough being enough means being comfortable with your body just as it is today being enough is being comfortable with what you have achieved as well as what you have not yet accomplished being enough means self-acceptance and it is something we can all say to ourselves more often let this feeling of being enough settle into your belief system for a moment longer let it sink into your body like muscle memory what you put out into this world will come back to you put out positivity send out love and light radiate this positive energy outward to the world and it will come back to you give what you wish to receive and now that you have let go of all the negativity and replaced it with positive love and light now you know it is time to open the door at the bottom of the stairway all the way you know it is time to let the light your light shine out all the way so you can live your fullest potential with a deep inner confidence and knowing that you are enough you can see yourself reach forward to open the door as you place your hand on the doorknob and pull all of your inner strength determination then potential flows out filling up your mind and the space around you feel the strength and positivity flow out from your mind and fill up your entire body and into your heart you are now completely full with potential and possibilities let yourself hear these words and feel their truth in your body you are confident and capable you are creative and intelligent you are enough and more because you have let go of all of the negative in your life you have the space to fill up with your full potential you know you are able to achieve great things now that your inner strength and potential have been released from behind this door and now you walk into this light feel the energy and strength of your full potential surrounding you filling you up this energy builds your confidence and motivation on the other side of the door you find a bench to sit down on here you can sit and contemplate your full potential and you take this new energy confidence and motivation and allow your mind to wander and be imaginative you allow yourself to be open to possibilities you are open to change and the opportunities that come with these changes you choose to soften into these possibilities lovingly although you have a strong idea of what you want and what is important to you you are willing to give a little and to be flexible you understand it takes time for changes to happen and take root you are patient and grateful for where you are on this journey you know you are exactly where you are supposed to be right now in life we often need to let go of what no longer serves us in order to make room for change in order to be open to the process of change wow this isn't always easy you are committed to doing what is right for your best interest and what is in alignment with your values rather than what's easy with change comes various emotions and you welcome them and you seek to feel them understand them and embrace these emotions without becoming attached to any outcomes you don't give up at times of unexpected challenge you persevere all of your thoughts are positive in your mind repeat after me I am open to change I am worthy of love and success I am confident I am diligent and moving towards my desired success I believe in myself and my abilities I am courageous and brave I am authentically me I am creating my own future I follow my dreams with passion and certainty I let go of the past and focus on the now I am enough I am grateful for today feeling confident

0 Find a comfortable position sitting or lying down. Notice how you are feeling right now...physically and mentally.  Take a deep breath in through your nose, and release the breath through your mouth.  Take another breath, and allow your breathing to relax you as you exhale fully.  Breathe in gently... and as you breathe out, let the air carry the tension out of your body.  Continue to breathe slowly and gently as you begin to focus on relaxing your body.  Notice where your body is tense. Focus your attention on one of these areas. As you breathe, picture that part of your body becoming slightly more relaxed than it was before. With each breath, that part of your body becomes a little more relaxed.  Imagine what the relaxation feels like... tingly... soft... gentle... calm... loose... free... and let that feeling of relaxation grow.  Scan your body for any areas of tension, and for each area, let the relaxation soften the muscles as they give up their hold. Let the feeling of relaxation grow...spreading calm throughout your body.  Breathe in relaxation... and breathe out tension...breathe in calm...and let all the tension go as you exhale...  Continue to breathe slowly, and gently, deepening your state of relaxation more and more with each breath. Deeper and deeper. More and more relaxed. Calm. At peace.  Now begin to create a picture in your mind. Imagine a place where you feel completely at ease. This might be a favorite place you have been, or somewhere you have seen, or it might be completely imaginary. It's up to you. Picture this place where you feel happy and calm.  Create the details about this place in your mind. Visualize the sights... sounds... and smells... of your place. Imagine how you feel physically. You are comfortable, enjoying the pleasant temperature... enjoying being still and relaxing or doing whatever enjoyable activities you participate in here...  Enjoy the way you feel in this safe place.  You feel calm and safe here. At peace with yourself.  Remain in your peaceful place while you meditate calmly and build your self-esteem.  Imagine that all of the following affirmations are true for you, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation you experience. Repeat each affirmation in your mind, or out loud, with conviction. Use your imagination to fully believe each self-esteem relaxation affirmation.    The self-esteem relaxation affirmations begin now.  I am at peace with myself.  I appreciate who I am.  I value myself as a person.  All people have value, and I am a valuable human being.  I deserve to relax  I deserve to be happy.  I embrace my happy feelings, and enjoy being content.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  When my mood is low, I accept my emotions and recognize that the low mood will pass, and I will be happy again. I look forward to the good times.  My future is bright and positive.  I look forward to the future, and I enjoy the present.  I look fondly upon many memories from my past.  I forgive myself for my mistakes. All people make mistakes. I used to feel regret about some of my mistakes because I am a good person and want to do the best that I can, and now, I am still a good person and I release the feelings of regret because I have learned and moved on. I forgive myself for errors I have made, because I have felt bad about them long enough. I have suffered enough, and now it is time to be free. By freeing myself from past mistakes, I can move on and do good things. I forgive myself.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  I feel good about who I am today.  I accept the person that I am. I accept my flaws, and accept my strengths.  I view my shortcomings as strengths not yet developed, rather than as weaknesses.  I eagerly develop new strengths.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  I approach challenges with strength.  I do the best that I can at the time. I give 100% effort when I am able and when I choose to put full effort toward the things that are important. I accept my imperfections and the imperfections in what I do. My efforts are good enough, and they're okay.  I do not have to be perfect to be okay as a person.  I am a human being with flaws. I enjoy being who I am, and love myself as I am.  I nurture the child within me.  I feel secure in who I am, and do not need to compare myself to others.  All of the strengths I have ever had are present in me today. I still have the same positive character, even if not all of my strengths are shown right now. I have all of those strengths of character, and will use those strengths again.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  I accept myself.  I care for myself.  I take time for myself, and enjoy it. I deserve time for myself, and I feel good about taking this time regularly.  I handle difficulties with grace.  I allow myself to experience and express emotions, both negative and positive.  I accept myself.  I am perfectly alright just the way I am.  I accept myself.  I am a valuable human being.  I accept myself.  I feel confident.  I accept myself.  I feel secure.  I accept myself.  I accept myself.   Think again about your peaceful place. Picture yourself enjoying this environment. Acknowledge the feelings you are experiencing after repeating the self-esteem relaxation affirmations. Accept any positive or negative feelings you are having. Allow yourself to feel calm and at peace. Now it is time to leave your special place. Know that you can return here in your imagination any time to relax, feel calm and relaxed, and feel comfortable and safe. Take with you the feelings of acceptance of yourself, and belief in the self-esteem relaxation affirmations. Continue to feel positive and accepting of yourself. Hold onto this secure feeling of self-esteem as you return to your day.  In a moment I will count to 3. If you choose to sleep, you can drift into a relaxing and pleasant sleep on the count of 3. If you wish to become fully awake, you can increase your alertness and become energized and fully alert on the count of 3.  One... take a deep, cleansing breath in... and exhale slowly.  Two... take another deep breath... and exhale...  Three... you are feeling calm, confident, and refreshed.

or stuck in life we are a culture of information overload and live in a busy over scheduled world where we often think we need to do it all and do it perfectly this mindset of being attached to the perfect outcomes can be at the root of overwhelm or anxiety and can cause you to get stuck in your thoughts or actions today we will begin the process of self inquiry to get curious about what we are really feeling be okay with life as it is and then nurture and open our hearts with kindness this process will help you to find peace from within let's begin make yourself comfortable with your arms and legs uncrossed make sure to turn off all possible distractions and set this time aside for you in a moment I will guide you through a body scan to begin the process of relaxation so you can release tension and negativity by letting go completely you can turn your attention inward and now allow your eyes to close gently and bring your focus to your breath [Music] without changing your breath simply notice how it flows in through your nose feel the cool air as it passes into your nostrils and fills you up encourage each natural out-breath to release any tension that you may be feeling continue to observe your breath and allow it to deepen naturally and slow down today you will practice connecting to what is true for you in your heart you will cultivate loving energy for yourself to nurture what is true for you and to find peace give yourself permission to be fully supported by the earth to connect to the collective energy of the universe and to be open to possibilities of what comes with the state of comfort and relaxation and now slowly begin to scan your body as I say each part of your body encouraged a release a complete relaxation to find ease in your body allow the surface below you to support you fully [Music] begin this body scan at your feet and simply relax move your attention up from your feet and begin to release your lower legs and knees feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and connected to the energy around you as you allow it to let go and now find a sense of ease and your thighs and hips as you let go completely moving up take a deep breath to help release any tightness in your lower back continue this process of increasing your comfort and connection to the collective energy of the universe around you and welcome a feeling of softening into your abdomen let your chest and arms rest heavy on the surface below you feel as your neck and throat release any physical and emotional tension that you may be holding on to [Music] allow your jaw to unclench and feel as the small muscles of your cheeks I then forehead soften and smooth and as the small muscles in your face and jaw let go the rest of your body follows and softens as well now your whole body is heavy on the earth [Music] and allowing your breath to return to its natural rhythm and flow you find that you are fully relaxed you know you are safe and supported and you are open to guiding yourself into a calm state of mind now that you are fully relaxed you can begin this inquiry process by checking in with what is true for you what you are actually feeling without judgment and without trying to change anything [Music] make space for the truth to surface and whatever form it comes simply allow it to surface [Music] consider the situation or feeling that has you overwhelmed or stuck recognize what you are feeling and accepted in the present moment know that the state of overwhelm is simply an obstacle on your path and it is part of your journey [Music] because this may be a negative or challenging emotion let down your guard and your armor to this emotion make space for awareness and acceptance without judgement we often have the unconscious impulse to push away suppress or ignore difficult emotions which simply brings about more suffering some might busy themselves to prove their worth or neglect what is really going on some may have a fear of failure and the overwhelm may paralyze them some may feel anxious or restless based on all that there is to do whatever you are feeling is okay these are simply patterns that have developed they are not you recognize the self-talk going on in your mind recognize the potential that you may have unmet or unrecognized expectations from yourself or others that may be playing a role in the judgments of yourself [Music] or possibly you're experiencing negative self-talk [Music] begin to move out of the thinking patterns and bring your attention to your felt experience no need to attach words or labels to your feelings simply explore what those feelings are [Music] pause and allow these feelings sometimes we may be judgmental when a negative feeling surfaces acknowledged the feeling and allow it to be what it is without judgment [Music] or sometimes we may push the feeling down and focus on something else [Music] in this situation being present is the way stay in the moment stay with the feeling and be okay with it continue to make space in your heart for these feelings to come up and simply be [Music] we may want to resist the discomfort of a negative feeling and remove ourselves from the present moment do your best to stay present and mindful in a time when difficult emotions come up practicing a moment of pause after recognizing a feeling or behavior gives you the opportunity to make another choice a different choice than you are used to making creating space during this moment of pause allows you to stop the negative habit or behavior before it continues it allows you to respond skillfully rather than reacting by simply allowing the difficult emotion to be what it is you are able to bring your awareness to the present moment experience and you may notice almost immediately a sense of softening and ease around the emotion simply by allowing it to be with honesty and acceptance comes the ability to move forward and to grow once you have recognized the emotion and allowed it to be what it is get curious about what you are feeling and what is behind the feeling explore your own truth breathe deeply to allow space for your truth to surface [Music] now is the time for some deep self inquiry start to ask yourself some questions about what you are experiencing what is underneath the feelings you are experiencing is there a physical component to how you are feeling the answers may not come immediately and that is okay continue to allow the emotions to surface in these next few moments of quiet make space for the truth and acceptance of what is the answers will come in time [Music] [Music] begin to let go of judgments let go of self-limiting beliefs let go of expectations let go of fear let go of any negativity you may be holding on to this negativity doesn't have to be named specifically just let it go let the energy of negativity go let go of any past negativities and replace them with positive thoughts and gratitude take a moment to release all that is holding you back all that you have pushed down any anger and resentment any fears and any negativity [Music] as you bring the feelings and emotions to the surface do so with a sense of unconditional love for yourself see what is really going on for you and proceed with care and compassion continue to come back to the felt experience and move out of the thinking patterns and then take some time to nurture yourself place your hand on your heart if you like and offer love and kindness to yourself open your heart and let it in offer positive energy to the area of your heart [Music] ask yourself what it is you need in this moment to care for yourself to nurture and support you ask this of yourself often and listen really listen to what it is that you need to calm the sense of overwhelm to get unstuck to find peace within and now bring your attention back to your physical body and deepen your breath once more you are now beginning your journey back to the present moment and as you do you will continue to nurture yourself with care and compassion you will find inner peace begin to reactivate each part of your body from its relaxed State feel the rush of energy back into your body like a warm wave coming over you awakening your body slowly and when you are ready open your eyes you are fully back in this present moment feeling awake and energized
0 Welcome to this simple meditation to relieve stress.  Get into a nice position where you can be upright, elongating the spine.  It is best to be seated in the traditional meditation position with legs crossed, but if you need to have your back supported, you may sit in a chair.  Gaze around with your eyes, taking note of your surroundings.  See the colors clearly.  Notice things that are completely still around you, like the ground, furniture, and structures.  Can you become aware of anything around you that has movement?  Look around without putting labels on the things you see, just observe their colors, textures and patterns.  Notice how far away things are from you, or how close they are.  See how the light lays upon things, illuminating them.  Allow your mind to naturally find a spot in front of you to fixate on.  Begin to slowly blink your eyes, and do not look away.  Feel the relaxation within the darkness each time you blink.  Repeat think until your eyes want to naturally close.  When you close your eyes, notice a gentle wave of relaxation sweep over your entire body.  Bring your awareness to your breath, what is it like?  Did you take a nice inhale as soon as you focused on your breathing?  Pay close attention to how your lungs expand and contract with your breath.  It is a very natural and gentle sensation.  Noticing how your belly also expands and contracts easily as you breathe.  Allow the breath to relax you.  In and out…..  Expand and contract….  Refresh and relax…..  Inhale and exhale…..

moment [Music] your life is a series of present moment experiences one breath at a time [Music] experience all there is to know about your breath [Music] [Music] perhaps you can notice something about your breath you may not have noticed before [Music] maybe you notice the cool air as it passes through your nostrils on your inhale or the warm quality of the air as it is being released know that each exhale is a time to let go even further into relaxation notice your breathing as it comes and goes [Music] noticing your breath you can relax further if you wish you may notice with the attention on your breath it has naturally slowed down it has relaxed you [Music] like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow down with every breath you may sense more space between your breaths as well

away any remaining tension or emotional strain from your body and your mind [Music] to fully engage with life it is important to acknowledge and accept your emotions letting go of labels of right or wrong and good or bad emotions are simply energy and when you allow yourself to experience these emotions as they arise the energy will move through you and the emotions do not need to rule you [Music] become aware of an emotion that is present within you now sense the feeling of this emotion with acceptance when you accept an emotion as it is in the present you can allow the energy to move through you [Music] acknowledge this emotion lean into this feeling and do your best to accept this emotion stay with the feeling of the emotion and let go of the story about the emotion you may begin to notice a sense of softening and ease around this emotion when you connect with and sit with this energy it doesn't have to rule you as it moves through you this energy allows you to become more aware of the full experience of life as you continue this relaxed inward awareness become aware of any thoughts arising witness them without following them see them surface flow by and disappear you may even think of thoughts as slippery objects that you couldn't hold on to even if you wanted to when you grasp or try to hold on to the thoughts they slip right out of your grip if it feels right to you as you notice the thinking as you breathe in say in your mind i am aware of thoughts arising as you breathe out say in your mind i am aware of thoughts passing or more simply thoughts arising thoughts passing allow this process to relax your mind and body [Music] even deeper you may even notice your thoughts coming with more space between them as you practice allowing them to rise and fall let go of judgments of thoughts knowing they are not good or bad be the witness of the thoughts in the present allow the thoughts to pass by like clouds in the sky they have their chance to be seen and honored and then they flowed away just as quickly allow ease to settle in to your mind and body allow yourself to go further still into relaxation as you shift your focus to the area of your heart begin to cultivate a positive quality of gratitude to change your state from within [Music] enjoy the expansive open space at your heart as you recall something or someone that naturally brings the feeling of gratitude into your heart hold on to this feeling of gratitude in your heart let gratitude arise and fill your body and mind [Music] allow yourself to be grateful and appreciate that life is a precious gift sense this gratitude not only in your heart but throughout your entire body connect with this gratitude and know that it is within you be open to seeing the positive in situations

0 thank you for taking the time to listen to this guided meditation to help reduce stress and anxiety this practice of relaxation is most beneficial when done regularly where the benefits are compounding and over time it will become easier for you while this practice of meditation will take many different forms and look different from person to person don't expect perfection be patient with your practice and the resulting effects if you find value from this and believe you know someone else that can benefit from listening please share with your friends and family the idea of being in the present moment is a powerful one when it comes to anxiety and stress we are often scheduled to the max and we become physically and emotionally stressed out we often find our mind cluttered and overthinking we worry about how the past could have gone differently where we wonder if the future will go as exactly as we plan it this meditation will help to calm down your overthinking mind it will help you to be present so that you can simplify and clear the clutter of your mind it has been said by many great thought leaders in this world but the way we do anything is the way we do everything so if we want to declutter our mind we must also declutter our physical world this mindfulness meditation can be used to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past and anxieties about the future more you practice this the easier it will become for you and you will see the benefits trickle over into many other areas of your life and now turn off all distractions and commit this time for yourself let go of your to-do lists and your responsibilities take this time for you for self-care of the gift to enjoy you must first help yourself and love yourself before you can help or love anyone else and when you are ready close your eyes and bring your full awareness to your breath begin to count your breath in then as you breathe out encourage the exhale to be one count longer than the inhale allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress and tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow and your body will calm down do this for a few breaths cycles then allow the breath to return to its natural rhythm know that your breath is an anchor to the present moment you know that you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment so you know you are always in the present moment when you are attentive to your breath as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer notice your thoughts and acknowledge them by saying in your mind thinking then come back to the breath and use this breath as an anchor to keep coming back to whenever your mind wanders this breath anchor is a grounding and stress relieving practice to continue outside of the session whenever you may experience a stressful situation at any point in life you can always just come back to your breath as if you are starting over this anchor will allow you to relax and times of stress as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and to slow down allow your body to soften and your breath to be gone know that your body responds to your thoughts so think about relaxing and ask your body for a release of tension your mind is so powerful in creating change in all aspects of your life and now as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up as you breathe out that white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of anxiety take a long slow deep breath in through your nose and now move the breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to just surrender as you exhale breathing out anything that no longer serves you each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even more deeply and now invite your body to relax each muscle completely begin with the muscles around the eyes and the jaw by relaxing these muscles specifically the rest of the body knows exactly what to do and will relax in response continue to unclench the jaw completely and soften the muscles around the eyes to begin to feel that familiar heaviness throughout the entire body all you have to do is think about relaxing and releasing the tension in your body and your body will respond because it listens to what your mind tells it and now feel the entire body let go feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside stay with your breath when you find your mind wandering stay with the physical sensations of your body so that your mind can continue to clear the clutter of the overthinking tendency know that your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you you are in complete control but for now your mind and body know it is time to relax and let go time to slow down right now all sounds around you are unimportant and they just add to your relaxation all responsibilities and items on your to-do list are unimportant right now all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow your body to relax and your subconscious mind will do the job of clearing the clutter notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper you now allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go letting your body mind and spirit become one and now begin to use your imagination and take a moment to see yourself in front of a beautifully decorated glass elevator door this class door is etched and frosted with the most amazing design on it see this design in your mind reach out and feel the texture with your fingertips feel the cool temperature of the glass this elevator will take you down to the deepest part of your subconscious mind so that you can declutter your thoughts release tension and negativity you see the door slowly opening and you step into the spacious elevator you know you are completely safe and you can see through the glass walls of the elevator you push the B button so that you can go down to the basement of your mind this elevator will lead you deep into relaxation each level will take you deeper down and in a moment as I begin to count the elevator will take you down slowly into a more deep relaxation you will find that a deeper down you go the more comfortable and the more relaxed you'll become 10 as the elevator begins at slow descent you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do eight you know you are right where you need to be on your journey and you allow the outside world to just to turn off seven each level down takes you even deeper into a relaxed state six you're committed to taking your life and dreams to the next level five letting go completely for going deeper and deeper into comfort the REE almost to the basement of your subconscious mind - deep deep relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and peace and now we have reached the bottom the elevator doors slowly open and you walk out into the basement of your subconscious mind you take a look around and see that you have stepped out into what looks like a library that stores all of your memories as well as the possibilities for your future there are rows and rows of shelves throughout the entire room each shelf filled with many many books you see books of all different sizes and colors some of the books are disorganized and there are areas of clutter around the floor in front of some of the shelves you feel an intense desire to organize the books so that they are easily accessed when needed and to clean up the clutter around the room knowing that by doing this you will organize and declutter your mind and your life you realize that just by thinking about organizing and cleaning magically this room changes the room becomes well-organized and the clutter is cleared this change has simplified your life and with this change you feel a positive change within yourself you know that deep inside you a switch has been reset so that everything works in your favor you are now organized and decluttered in all areas of your life as well as your thinking mind you are able to generate support and inspiration for yourself far more easily than before you enrich yourself mentally emotionally and spiritually to do all that it takes to actualize your goals thrive and live in alignment with your values and intentions you begin to take even better care of yourself you redefine yourself as a happier energetic and more lighthearted person you feel the physical weight of anxiety has been lifted to allow you to be a lighter and calmer you allow new and more empowered thoughts and inspired feelings of success healing wellness and happiness to profoundly build within you you respect yourself showing yourself loving kindness and compassion and now you let go of any negative thoughts that no longer serve you you let go of any pasts negativities and you replace them with positive behaviors positive thoughts and feelings of gratitude you are aware of your thoughts and you have the ability to change from a negative thought to a positive one just by being aware you believe that you could be strong and confident in your life you see your past limiting beliefs and behaviors disappear self-doubt fear and anxiety are things of the past and you replace them with optimism confidence and an easily calm disposition you trust your instincts and your abilities you are easily able to accept things as they are knowing that you are exactly where you are supposed to be on your journey and now bringing your attention to the room around you take one last look around at the organized and decluttered space of your subconscious mind know that this new organized space will translate to stress free anxiety free living in all aspects of your life now as you begin to walk back towards the elevator the doors slowly open and invite you in as you step into the elevator you have a strong sense that you can continue to reduce stress and anxiety in your life by continuing the process of simplifying and clearing the clutter oh you are capable of achieving your dreams and you have the potential to accomplish great things now bring your attention back to your physical body and your breath you will easily and effortlessly be able to use the breath as an anchor when you come out of the state of relaxation and now as an observer see yourself smiling with a positive calm and competent mind feeling proud and grateful when you awake you will still feel all of the positive feelings you experienced in this meditation and you have patience and persistence for the practice of simplifying and decluttering your mind and physical world in just a moment I will count as the elevator slowly brings you back up and when you get to the top you will begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment feeling relaxed yet energized and confident one you are slowly beginning to come out of the state of

0 you gonna sit with me girl am i live all right welcome welcome everyone thanks for joining me uh if you're new here i'm sarah raymond with the mindful movement i'm really honored to have you here and if you are joining me again welcome back uh if you if you have been here you might notice that this is not my typical space i am outside it is cold in maryland so i have my my lovely scarf that my daughter knitted for me sorry crocheted excuse me she will get mad that i said that and uh we got a fire and here i am i'm glad to be here and i just want to take a minute to talk a little bit about control so we don't really have control right like i don't have control over the wind tonight i don't have control over the smoke that might blow into my face or the dog's making noise or all of the things so we do have choice so i decided i wanted to go live tonight i made the choice that i was okay with not having control over the lighting and the space and the temperature and all the things and i made the choice to respond in a way that i could still feel safe and i could be okay with my choice and that's the lesson or the the teaching i'd love to embody or impart in today's practice so if you do hear the wind blowing then i invite you to sit with it recognize how your body instinctively responds you might even acknowledge that response and see if you can still work to calm your body calm your responses as we go through the practice so that's my my intention my invitation for you and if you have any other intention for today's practice then please honor that and that being said today's practice will be very gentle not a lot of movement per se but self massage and various exercises to help you regulate your nervous system or calm the nervous system and we're not going to get into a lot of the science or the what's happening just to feel into the experience but i did leave a link in the description box below the video to two different books that are great resources so if you do want to learn a little bit more check those out all right so let's jump right in so make yourself comfortable i'm sitting down obviously you're welcome to sit in a chair if that's more comfortable for you i would suggest being upright for at least the first portion of it as we get into the meditation then you can lie down and i should mention that les is here with us behind the camera and he will be in the chat so if you have any questions comments please feel free to leave them i'm just getting uh getting a signal we all good less we're all good someone's saying please rotate if possible rotate and here is the we don't have control over everything i think we just have to go with it and we're going to do the best we can tonight am i vertical i think they can rotate it from their device mine looks normal okay less is saying we just gotta go with the flow you can rotate it from their device he is saying you can rotate from your device i hope that helps rotate on your device okay thank you uh we're gonna we're gonna go with the flow tonight and i apologize if there's any glitches or tech technical issues but i hope that you enjoy the practice okay so let's start with a belly breath as a way to just check in so i like to have hands on my belly so i can get a feel for the movement there nothing forced nothing too strenuous just checking in so if you feel like you want to close your eyes you are welcome to do so and then begin to breathe in through your nose sending your breath down into your belly and as you breathe out you might like to breathe out through your mouth like a sigh so you're making a sound if that doesn't feel comfortable any other breath pattern is fine so taking a moment to check in and what i mean by that is notice the state of your body the state of your mind and you might even notice the state of your nervous system no judgment no need to change at this point just noticing you might think of taking like a snapshot in your memory of how you're feeling in this moment and then once you have that baseline let's blink our eyes open again if they were closed and then we're going to go into a little bit of self massage and everything that i offer is just that it's an offering take it if you like it but listen to your body and if it's saying no this isn't so so right for me right now just explore see what your body needs today all right so we're going to start with a a jaw massage so you can find the indentation at the jaw so it's about in line with the earlobe and pardon my dogs you're gonna press your fingers into your jaw fairly firmly going inward listen to your body and you decide how much pressure is right for you and then you can explore maybe circles feel great maybe just holding the pressure feels good perhaps you want to go up and down side to side you can open and close your jaw you might take a nice deep breath in and let it out like a sigh relaxing the lower portion of your jaw all right so if that feels great and you want to keep going keep going otherwise i'll move on to just um to the side of your nose so you think of the the lines that are the crease of our between our nose and our mouth you're gonna go about the top of that crease and you'll press in towards your nose a bit and then once you have that pressure gently pull out so it's almost like you're opening your sinuses and then just like we did with the jaw maybe circles feel great or maybe up and down i know it looks a little silly but we can all be silly together or maybe just hold the pressure and here's a nice place to gently pull out on the skin out on the muscles and take a deep breath in you might even feel you get more air in and let it go again stay there a little longer if you'd like otherwise we're going to go to the corner inside corner of your eyebrows so press pressing in gently you might just let your head rest in your hands and then same options go here you can move around in a circle it'll be a pretty small circle or just up and down and side to side and then again feel free to stay a little longer and then lastly we're going to go to the ears so i'll give you lots of options and you can choose what feels really good leave what doesn't and we'll start inside of the ear so not in the hole of your ear but in the on the cartilage and you're just going to kind of follow the line follow the different parts of your ears around kind of like what you might use a q-tip for although you're not going to go inside the ear canal and then i don't know if you can see this but you're going to grab the earlobes and just gently you can pull out you can pull forward and then work your way up the side of the ear and this area for me always feels really nourishing really relaxing my dogs are going a little crazy running around okay and then just relax your arms by your sides if you want to close your eyes again you can and let's take one more check in so all we've really done is a little bit of self-massage so just notice how that is serving you and just keep in mind everyone's different your body is different your nervous system is different your personal history is different from mine and anyone else that's watching so your experience in this practice will also be different so just take what you like and leave the rest okay so a little bit more nervous system resetting and then we'll move into our meditation so you'll keep your your eye gaze looking forward and then i'll mirror you you can tip your left shoulder excuse me left ear towards your left shoulder without lifting your your shoulder to meet your ear so keep drawing the shoulder down there we go and then with your head still take your eyes as far to your right as you can so it's almost like you're trying to see your right ear with your head tipped to your left keep your eyes fixed right deep breath in through your nose let it out with a sigh again feel free to come out of this sooner if you feel any need to do so one more deep breath in through your nose out like a thigh take your time bring your head back to center eyes back to looking straight ahead blink a couple times and then we'll repeat in the other direction so your right ear towards your right shoulder and then eyes looking as far to your left as you can breathing in and out three breaths if you can come out of it sooner if you need to ah and then the head comes back up eyes look forward blink a few times and then we'll do a variation of that with a side bend so i'm going to offer the side bend if it's too much don't worry about adding it so we'll go back to left ear towards the left shoulder and then you might allow for a little bit more of a side bend so meaning you're you're taking your spine over to your left and if you still want a little bit more your left hand can gently uh gently gently tug on your head and then we'll take eyes now to the left ear so you're looking towards the arm that's up my glasses always seem to be in the way for this one all right so about three breaths there and as you breathe out through your mouth think of relaxing your jaw may even wiggle it side to side and then take your time coming back through center and then other side so we go right here towards the right shoulder feel free to add a little side bend to your right and then option to take your right hand gently very very gently we're not tugging too hard here and then eyes are going to your towards your right ear so it's kind of on a downward diagonal about three breaths uh and then bring your head and eyes back to center okay so i feel a lot more calm than i did when we started so i hope that you do as well although it's not a requirement obviously if that's not how you feel that's your experience but i would love to guide you now into a meditation so if you prefer to lie down you are welcome to do so make yourself comfortable and if you prefer to sit up that's fine too so i like to think of posture as something that we don't have to really think about so get yourself into a position that doesn't take a lot of effort but allows you to be in a a straight spine position and then if you'd like you are welcome to close your eyes you don't have to we want you to feel safe so if you choose not to close your eyes maybe just soften your gaze downward and then just as we started take a moment to simply notice without judgment without the need to change you might notice the state of your physical body state of your your mind your thoughts you might become aware of sounds in your environment sounds coming through the video from my environment and the practice that we just finished we just went through is about inner resourcing about using your own ability to come into a calm state and so when there is a noise when there is a distraction because there will always be distractions the practice is about coming back to yourself coming home to yourself so with that in mind let's begin to move into a box breathing pattern so we are taking a little intention into our breath so we're breathing in for a count holding for the same count breathing out for the same count and holding once more so you might choose to start with a count of three or four and just see how that feels in your body so in your own time breathing in holding breathing out holding continue on your own for a few breaths if you want to increase the length the count of your breath that's fine if you find you get distracted or lose your count simply start over finish the breath cycle that you are on and just allow your breath to be natural and see what you notice are there sensations showing up in your body you might even ask yourself is there a message here as you notice my dog's barking notice your response can you lovingly start over can you lovingly bring yourself home to your experience so in this hopefully calm and reflective state you can ask yourself what is it that i need and just listen no thinking no trying just allow the answer to surface what is it that i need you might notice how your body your mind your nervous system are all responding to this question when was the last time someone asked you that and how does it feel to be able to ask yourself to connect with your inner resources so take another moment to just notice what's there for you and very gradually begin to let your awareness brought in you might start by noticing the support beneath you noticing the air touching any exposed skin [Music] or perhaps you are able to sense the energy around you and before you open your eyes if they're still closed see if you can sense both your inner experience and your outer environment the same time and as best you can keep that awareness of both your inner and outer experience as you blink your eyes open if they were closed coming back to full awareness you might rub your hands together just create a little warmth i know it's a little cold out here for me and then taking the warmth of your hands place the heel of your hands over your eyes very gentle pressure and then you might lean your head the weight of your head down into your hands and just rest there for a moment and you can let go of what you do not need and then gradually releasing your hands lifting your head and i would just love to thank you so much for joining me today in this not-so-typical recording environment i hope that you got what you needed from this experience and i would love to offer you if you are interested in more practices to build a foundation of meditation to check out our free seven-day course the

0 Begin to relax, finding a comfortable position and starting to let the tension leave your body.  Imagine that you are at the top of a stairway. At the bottom of the stairway is a state of peace, calm, and relaxation.  Take note of how you are feeling right now, at the top of the stairway.  Imagine taking a step down the stairway... a single step closer to relaxation. As you take this step, feel your arms relaxing. Becoming heavy. Limp... loose... relaxed.    Further descend the stairway, going down toward relaxation..... down.... down.... to a state of calm and relaxation. Feel your legs relaxing and becoming limp. Your legs are feeling very heavy.... so heavy... feel your legs sinking down, the heaviness pulling your legs down into relaxation.  Picture yourself going slowly down the stairway, one step at a time. It is a comfortable, safe descent to a place of relaxation. Move down step by step, at your own pace, becoming more and more relaxed with each step you take.  Feel the heaviness in your arms and legs.... your arms are so warm and so heavy.... feel gravity pull on your arms gently, pulling your shoulders down into a relaxed position.  Take another step down.... and another.... more deeply relaxed with each step. Feel your neck and back relaxing. Feeling warm, loose... relaxed.  You might even become a bit sleepy as you get closer and closer to relaxation. That's okay.   Allow your mind to drift and your body to relax, heavy and comfortable. Your head and face relax.  Feel the muscles of your face becoming limp, soft, relaxed. Your eyelids are very heavy. It feels so good to close your eyes... your eyelids are so heavy, you cannot keep them open. So heavy and relaxed.  Moving down the stairway, down, down... almost to the bottom now.... when you reach the bottom you will be pleasantly relaxed.  The closer you get to the bottom, the heavier and more relaxed you feel. Your body is so heavy.... but at the same time feels light, as if floating. It is an unusual feeling, but pleasant. So peaceful. Drifting in calm relaxation.  Take the last few steps down to the bottom of the stairway..... sinking into relaxation. So heavy and relaxed.  Reaching the bottom now.... a state of calm and relaxation. You are now feeling peaceful and relaxed.  Now I'll repeat some affirmations for self-esteem. You don't even have to listen or pay attention, you can simply relax while I talk.  Just let your mind drift, and reflect upon these affirmations for self-esteem in the back of your mind, with your subconscious. You can take in the affirmations for self-esteem if you choose to and if they are a good fit for you, and disregard any that do not apply.  Just relax now and let your mind drift for the remainder of this affirmations for self-esteem script.  At the end of the script, I'll count back from 5 to 1, and you can choose to reawaken or drift off to sleep.... but for now, just relax... letting your mind drift.... there is nothing you need to do.... nothing you need to focus on.... just relaxed and calm.  Just let these words drift in your mind, without needing to focus especially on any of them.  You are a worthwhile person.  You are capable of achieving many things.  You deserve to be happy. You can be happy even through difficult circumstances.  You can handle the problems that come your way.  You are a strong person... while understanding that no one needs to be strong all the time.  You are an okay person.... a good person.  Your worth is not measured by achievements, appearance, or other external things. You are worthwhile as a person, just the way you are.  You are perfectly alright, just the way you are.  Accept yourself.  Be kind to yourself.  Take good care of yourself physically and emotionally.  You are okay the way you are.  (pause)  Continue to allow your mind to drift, as you just relax. Allow these affirmations for self-esteem to be true for you, repeating them silently in your mind if you want to, or simply taking them in.  I am a worthwhile person.  I deserve to be happy. I deserve good things.  I am a human being with flaws. It is okay to have flaws.   I am unique, and I appreciate my uniqueness.  I am perfectly alright, just the way I am.  I feel good about myself.  It is okay to like myself.  I am likable.  I have many good qualities.  I am a decent human being.  I do some things wrong and many things right.  I learn from my mistakes, and forgive myself when I make them.  I take time for myself. I deserve this time, and need this time.  I take care of others and I take care of me.  I accept help, support, and love from others.  I am confident.  I hold myself in high regard.  I like myself.  I accept myself.  I am not perfect, and that is okay.  I accept myself.  (pause)  Continue allowing your mind to drift.... relaxing. Let the affirmations for self-esteem become true for you, filling you with a sense of confidence and self-assurance.  You are capable of making positive changes.... capable of increasing your self-esteem.... and of nurturing your self-esteem.  Simply relax now, noticing what it is like to feel good about yourself.... allowing yourself to feel calm and confident.   (pause)  Keep with you this feeling of self-esteem. Remember the affirmations for self-esteem, taking them in and believing them as truth for you.  You can continue to feel good about yourself and keep this feeling of self-assurance, even after you are finished this affirmations for self-esteem script.  I'll count now from 5 to 1, and you can choose to drift off to sleep or become fully awake. When I reach one, you will be either in a state of deep sleep or you will be fully alert and awake, depending on how you have chosen to conclude this affirmations for self-esteem script.  5  4  3  2  1  
0 Begin by taking a deep breath and hold it for 5 seconds…(pause for 5 seconds)…exhale and relax…(pause for 5 seconds)...take another deep breath, as deep as you can, and hold it, count for 5 seconds…(pause for 5 seconds) and as you exhale just imagine blowing out all of your stress…(pause for 5 seconds)...take a third deep breath and hold it…(pause for 5 seconds)...and as you exhale you blow out any stress you’ve been holding on to, saying to yourself “relax now”  [pause for 3 seconds, speaking now with confidence and at a normal pace of speech]  This is your new solution to stress.  Whenever you become stressed in the future, you simply take 3 fully in and deep breaths, holding it at the top of the inhalation for 5 seconds, and when you exhale, blow out any stresses that you feel.  And on the third breath as you exhale you simply say to yourself, relax now.  [Pause for 5 seconds] [speaking slowly with a soothing and gentle voice]  [Body Scan Induction]  Begin by slowly blinking your eyes, and with each number I say, blink once. (pause for 3 seconds in between each number) 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.  Allow your eyes to gently close, and when you do this you feel a wave of relaxation sweep over you.  [speaking even slower now]  Now I’d like for you to focus on the sensations at the top of your head.  Just notice how the very top of your head feels.  [Pause for 5 seconds]  And now let your focus move down to your eyes.  Just notice how your eyes feel and ask them to relax even more.  The little movement in your eyes is called rapid eve movement and is completely normal.

your friends and family the idea of being in the present moment is a powerful one when it comes to anxiety and stress we are often scheduled to the max and we become physically and emotionally stressed out we often find our mind cluttered and overthinking we worry about how the past could have gone differently where we wonder if the future will go as exactly as we plan it this meditation will help to calm down your overthinking mind it will help you to be present so that you can simplify and clear the clutter of your mind it has been said by many great thought leaders in this world but the way we do anything is the way we do everything so if we want to declutter our mind we must also declutter our physical world this mindfulness meditation can be used to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past and anxieties about the future more you practice this the easier it will become for you and you will see the benefits trickle over into many other areas of your life and now turn off all distractions and commit this time for yourself let go of your to-do lists and your responsibilities take this time for you for self-care of the gift to enjoy you must first help yourself and love yourself before you can help or love anyone else and when you are ready close your eyes and bring your full awareness to your breath begin to count your breath in then as you breathe out encourage the exhale to be one count longer than the inhale allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress and tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow and your body will calm down do this for a few breaths cycles then allow the breath to return to its natural rhythm know that your breath is an anchor to the present moment you know that you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment so you know you are always in the present moment when you are attentive to your breath as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer notice your thoughts and acknowledge them by saying in your mind thinking then come back to the breath and use this breath as an anchor to keep coming back to whenever your mind wanders this breath anchor is a grounding and stress relieving practice to continue outside of the session whenever you may experience a stressful situation at any point in life you can always just come back to your breath as if you are starting over this anchor will allow you to relax and times of stress as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and to slow down allow your body to soften and your breath to be gone know that your body responds to your thoughts so think about relaxing and ask your body for a release of tension your mind is so powerful in creating change in all aspects of your life and now as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up as you breathe out that white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of anxiety take a long slow deep breath in through your nose and now move the breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to just surrender as you exhale breathing out anything that no longer serves you each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even more deeply and now invite your body to relax each muscle completely begin with the muscles around the eyes and the jaw by relaxing these muscles specifically the rest of the body knows exactly what to do and will relax in response continue to unclench the jaw completely and soften the muscles around the eyes to begin to feel that familiar heaviness throughout the entire body all you have to do is think about relaxing and releasing the tension in your body and your body will respond because it listens to what your mind tells it and now feel the entire body let go feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside stay with your breath when you find your mind wandering stay with the physical sensations of your body so that your mind can continue to clear the clutter of the overthinking tendency know that your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you you are in complete control but for now your mind and body know it is time to relax and let go time to slow down right now all sounds around you are unimportant and they just add to your relaxation all responsibilities and items on your to-do list are unimportant right now all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow your body to relax and your subconscious mind will do the job of clearing the clutter notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper you now allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go letting your body mind and spirit become one and now begin to use your imagination and take a moment to see yourself in front of a beautifully decorated glass elevator door this class door is etched and frosted with the most amazing design on it see this design in your mind reach out and feel the texture with your fingertips feel the cool temperature of the glass this elevator will take you down to the deepest part of your subconscious mind so that you can declutter your thoughts release tension and negativity you see the door slowly opening and you step into the spacious elevator you know you are completely safe and you can see through the glass walls of the elevator you push the B button so that you can go down to the basement of your mind this elevator will lead you deep into relaxation each level will take you deeper down and in a moment as I begin to count the elevator will take you down slowly into a more deep relaxation you will find that a deeper down you go the more comfortable and the more relaxed you'll become 10 as the elevator begins at slow descent you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do eight you know you are right where you need to be on your journey and you allow the outside world to just to turn

comfort the REE almost to the basement of your subconscious mind - deep deep relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and peace and now we have reached the bottom the elevator doors slowly open and you walk out into the basement of your subconscious mind you take a look around and see that you have stepped out into what looks like a library that stores all of your memories as well as the possibilities for your future there are rows and rows of shelves throughout the entire room each shelf filled with many many books you see books of all different sizes and colors some of the books are disorganized and there are areas of clutter around the floor in front of some of the shelves you feel an intense desire to organize the books so that they are easily accessed when needed and to clean up the clutter around the room knowing that by doing this you will organize and declutter your mind and your life you realize that just by thinking about organizing and cleaning magically this room changes the room becomes well-organized and the clutter is cleared this change has simplified your life and with this change you feel a positive change within yourself you know that deep inside you a switch has been reset so that everything works in your favor you are now organized and decluttered in all areas of your life as well as your thinking mind you are able to generate support and inspiration for yourself far more easily than before you enrich yourself mentally emotionally and spiritually to do all that it takes to actualize your goals thrive and live in

anxiety has been lifted to allow you to be a lighter and calmer you allow new and more empowered thoughts and inspired feelings of success healing wellness and happiness to profoundly build within you you respect yourself showing yourself loving kindness and compassion and now you let go of any negative thoughts that no longer serve you you let go of any pasts negativities and you replace them with positive behaviors positive thoughts and feelings of gratitude you are aware of your thoughts and you have the ability to change from a negative thought to a positive one just by being aware you believe that you could be strong and confident in your life you see your past limiting beliefs and behaviors disappear self-doubt fear and anxiety are things of the past and you replace them with optimism confidence and an easily calm disposition you trust your instincts and your abilities you are easily able to accept things as they are knowing that you are exactly where you are supposed to be on your journey and now bringing your attention to the room around you take one last look around at the organized and decluttered space of your subconscious mind know that this new organized space will translate to stress free anxiety free living in all aspects of your life now as you begin to walk back towards the elevator the doors slowly open and invite you in as you step into the elevator

and you have the potential to accomplish great things now bring your attention back to your physical body and your breath you will easily and effortlessly be able to use the breath as an anchor when

positive feelings you experienced in this meditation and you have patience and persistence for the practice of simplifying and decluttering your mind and physical world in just a moment I will count

0 This practice provides a different lens through which you can examine the body.  Give yourself space to drop in and deeply investigate these elements in your body.  Try to bring an open mind, and see what you can learn about yourself.  Remember that mindfulness is about seeing clearly, and looking at things from a new perspective can often bring that clarity.  Settle into a relaxed position.  Close the eyes, and bring your awareness to the places in the body where you experience contact, such as the feet on the floor, the hands in the lap, or the body sitting in the chair.  Begin with the element of earth or solid form.  Without thinking too hard about what this means, openly examine where and how you can feel solidity.  This might be the structure of your skeleton, the chair you’re sitting on, any places of tension in the body, or the weight of your muscles as they relax.  Don’t rush through these sensations or try to force them.  When you feel the earth element in the body, stay with it for a few deep breaths.  Continue this seeking, recognizing, and feeling for a few breaths.  After five minutes, switch to the element of air or wind.  An obvious place to start is in the form of the body breathing.  Where can you feel the air of the breath?  You may also look for places in the body where you can feel empty space—  the nostrils, the mouth, and the ears can offer insight into the air element.
0 Begin by getting comfortable. You may want to sit or lie down. Close your eyes, or focus your gaze on one spot in the room.  Start to relax your body, beginning with your feet. Allow a feeling of relaxation to fill your feet...feeling heavy, loose, and relaxed. Relax your ankles...lower legs...and knees.  Allow the relaxation to continue, relaxing your upper legs. Let the muscles of your legs completely let go...feeling very heavy and relaxed.  Relax your hips and pelvis, and all the surrounding muscles. Feel your stomach and lower back relaxing...the muscles giving up their hold.  Feel the relaxation in your chest, back, and sides...feeling very relaxed...very heavy.  Let your hands relax, all the way from your fingertips to your wrists. Feel your lower arms relaxing...letting go. Relax your elbows and upper arms...loose and heavy.  Relax your shoulders, feeling them lowering slightly...finding a comfortable, relaxed position...free from tension...  Allow the muscles of your neck to relax...letting go...and relax your face and head.  Feel your entire body relaxing even more deeply...becoming completely relaxed...limp...heavy...comfortable.  Now turn your attention inward...even more deeply inside...to find your authentic self.  Begin by reflecting upon your values. What is the most important to you in life? What do you value? Where does your sense of right and wrong come from? Spend the next few moments thinking about your values.  (Pause)  The values you have been thinking of make up part of the core of who you are. If you are being true to your values, these core beliefs will drive your behavior.  It feels good to behave in ways that are consistent with your values. For example, if honesty is something you value, this could be reflected in your life by being truthful. If you value your family, perhaps your life reflects this in the time you spend with family members.  Think about how your values can be a part of your day-to-day life.   (Pause)  Now consider what else makes you who you are. Finding your authentic self involves learning who you truly are. Your authentic self is the real you, the person you are truly meant to be. Your authentic self is the person you are the core, the person you can be if nothing holds you back.  Imagine the person you believe yourself to be right now. It's okay if you aren't quite sure who you are...just picture yourself going about the things you usually do in a typical day. Imagine that you are watching yourself...observing yourself going about your usual activities.  See yourself getting up in the morning...going about your day...imagine the things that you do in a typical day. See yourself doing these activities.  Picture this person...you...standing in an empty room. Imagine watching this person...observe...now imagine you could strip away all the things that hold you back from your full potential. Imagine self-doubt dissolving...being replaced with confidence and self-assurance. Picture this person before you, and imagine all the things that get in the way of success...such as circumstances, lack of resources, lack of forgiveness, illness, baggage from the past...anything that is holding this person back in any way at all...   See these problems dissolving...disappearing...going away...  Now imagine this person, standing in the empty room. What is left? Who is this person when all those barriers are stripped away?  This person is you. Imagine who you are at the core...the pure character that is left when there is nothing to get in the way of complete self-expression.  You may only have a vague picture in your mind right now...let's allow that picture to come into focus...becoming more clear...  Think of your motivations...what motivates you? What drives your behavior? What catches your interest...or has caught your interest in the past? What propels you to action?  Think about your personality and character traits...the characteristics that are left when all barriers are removed and all fears have gone away. At your fullest potential, your simplest form...with no fears...what traits do you have? Think about your energy...are you laid back and calm, or are you energetic? Think about your other characteristics...  Are you introverted or extroverted?  Quiet or talkative?  Are you creative?  Are you practical?  What sorts of things do you appreciate?  What do you admire?  What do you like?  Imagine something that makes you feel happy...what is it?  Think of some things you enjoy...things that you like to do...  Think about all the characteristics of the person who is left when all barriers and fears are removed.  (Pause)  Now let's create a different picture. Imagine yourself as a young child, in a happy moment. See the potential in this child. Who is this young person? What makes this child who he or she is?  (Pause)  Think about the characteristics that you share with this child. In what ways are you similar? In what ways does the current you differ from this child? Think about how you have learned and grown since the time you were a small child.  (Pause)  Now picture yourself as the child...see the world through your younger self's eyes.  What did you want to be when you grew up? What hopes did you have for your future self? What dreams did you have as a child?  The hopes and dreams you had as a child were probably related in some way to your authentic self. Something about your dreams was connected to a part of your true self. What do these aspirations say about who you are? What personal characteristics of yours are related to your childhood dreams?  For example, if as a child you dreamed about becoming an astronaut, you probably have some personality traits that relate to this dream...such as being adventurous, curious, analytical...  Think about your own childhood dreams, and see what these dreams say about who you are.  (Pause)  Now create one final picture in your mind. Imagine, in as much detail as you can, the person you want to be. Imagine your ideal self...  How would this person behave? What does this person, your authentic self, value? What motivates this ideal self? What personal characteristics are present in this ideal version of you? Imagine all the details of the person you most want to be.  (Pause)  The image in your mind right now, of this ideal person, is you. This is your authentic self. This is who you are. At the core, beneath all of life's getting in the way...this is you.  Spend a few moments with this image of your authentic self.  Now allow yourself to step inside this image, and fully become this person. Become who you are. For this moment, just be...simply be your authentic self.  Feel a sense of calm and serenity...secure in who you are...knowing who you are. This is you. Your authentic self.  You can take this authentic self with you...allowing this true essence of you to shine through in everyday life. Allow your values, personality, and motivations to shine though...to guide your behavior...to make up who you are.  You have always been this person...you always will be your authentic self...a positive, confident person. A person you like and appreciate. Underneath the challenges, the baggage, the demands of living life...this is the real you that will always be with you.  (Pause)  It's time to reawaken now...to conclude this relaxation exercise...  Keep the image of your authentic self with you as you go about the rest of your day. Express this true self...and allow you to simply be you.  Wiggle your fingers, waking up your hands and arms...  Move your toes, allowing your feet and legs to wake up...  Feel your muscles reawakening...and your whole body filling with energy.  Open your eyes and sit quietly for a moment while you reorient to your surroundings...  When you are completely awake and alert, you can return to your usual activities, feeling confident and calm, in touch with your authentic self.
0 when you can route yourself in the present moment it allows you to let go of the worry of what's to come in the future and possible regrets about what has happened in the past create a safe and tranquil environment for yourself to experience the stress relief of being present this practice will not only relieve the stress you may be experiencing now but also releases stress you may be carrying from the past hello and welcome I'm Sara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing let's settle in to this relaxing meditation I invite you to make yourself as comfortable as possible find a position that you can be relaxed yet alert  [Laughter]  make any adjustments to your posture or your surroundings so that you can come into a place of effortless ease perhaps close your eyes or soften your gaze take in a deep breath through your nose and sigh it out through your mouth take two more breaths just like this to begin to calm your body and mind and now enjoy the easy flow of your natural breath today we will use our senses to observe the present moment mindfulness is in essence the practice of bringing your awareness into the present moment begin now to use your sense of hearing to broaden your field of awareness listen to the sounds in your immediate surroundings what noises can you hear that are close to you  are there sounds of the heater or air-conditioning running is there a clock ticking  do you hear birds or animals are there cars or other vehicles bringing noise to your awareness listen to the sound of my voice to be in a relaxed state in this present moment what is the subtlest sound that you can detect when you listen even if you have headphones on maybe you can detect a quiet buzz on the recording or some other sound in the background what would it be like to let the sounds around you come to you rather than working to search them out are you able to hear your own sounds the sounds of your breathing this is the practice of observation without judgment it is not about what you find but that you are looking let these sounds be your teacher of the present moment experience rather than a distraction begin to let the intensity of your listening fade as if the sounds blur into the background of your focus  and then become aware of what you can see while you likely have your eyes closed do you see blackness on the inside of your eyelids or do you detect the smallest amount of light coming through maybe you can see patches or swirls of color  take a moment to notice all that you can see  inviting your attention now to move to your sense of smell notice the most prevalent smell you can detect  perhaps it is the scent of your body care products or maybe there are flowers in the room or maybe you are simply aware that there seems to be no specific smell around you  remember this is about bringing your awareness into the present moment by noticing your senses rather than judging or labeling good or bad  let your awareness move now to anything you can taste do you notice the faint taste of toothpaste or a minty gum  perhaps you're aware of the taste of your last drink or meal still lingering inside your mouth or you may simply notice the wet sensation in your mouth allow your awareness to notice what your physical body is experiencing now feel the sensation that draws your attention most prominently again no need to judge or label good or bad just notice [Music] notice the areas where your body meets the support beneath you become aware of where your clothes or your hair subtly brush your skin [Music] since the energy where one part of your body is touching another part can you sense the vibrations of your energy what do you feel at the palms of your hands is there energy vibrations or a sense of buzzing there [Music] do you feel a certain temperature in your fingertips often times we can connect to our own innate energy simply by attending to the energy of our hands what is the volume of what your body is telling you are there areas that are louder than others asking for you to listen are there any subtle messages being offered within you [Music] as you are attending to the sense of touch in various ways take a moment to soften and release anywhere you can since the shift in your body [Music] [Music] it is often said there is a sixth sense the sense is the power of perception similar but not one of the five physical senses it is a strong intuitive power by connecting with your feelings and emotions during meditation you can develop this instinct or sixth sense listen inward for what you are feeling right now is there contentment or peace [Music] what are the other qualities you are aware of when you quietly observe look inward not inwards or labels but in sensations and feelings without judgment these sensations and the awareness of the sensations the listening inward it allows you to connect with your body and your heart listen to your heart what do you hear from your heart right now [Music] it's okay if it seems nothing is coming to you now it will this is the practice of present moment observation and opening to the possibilities of what you may find [Music] we practice witnessing the present moment because stress is experienced when living in the past or the future peace is found right here right now move towards peace take a moment longer to notice your senses again perhaps you can become aware of all of your senses at the same time or choose to scan through them each again  take another deep breath with your eyes still closed as you slowly invite your field of awareness to broaden outward once more notice sounds sights smells tastes and feelings  as you are beginning to open your field of awareness and sense your surroundings see if you can do so while you continue to stay connected with your inner experience and when you feel ready gradually let a little light in through your eyes and take in your surroundings once more continue to practice using your senses to come to the present moment any time throughout your day to experience a sense of peace in the now thank you so much for practicing with me today I hope you have a peaceful and calm day
0 welcome to the daily calm let's start today's session by finding a comfortable position with a tall straight back allow your arms to rest gently when you're ready close your eyes bring full attention to this very moment settling in and allowing the mind and body to still and with openness patience and curiosity bring your awareness to the breath a deep breath in and releasing it fully follow the breath as it flows in and out of your body taking one last deep breath before letting the breath settle allowing it to feel natural and easy don't try to force the breath or regulate it in any way just allow it to flow naturally on its own so and we'll scan down the body now concentrating our attention from part to part start by bringing your attention to the top of your head and scalp feeling whatever's happening in this area you might feel tingling or heat throbbing or soft vibrations there may be strong sensation or you might not feel much at all now lower your attention to your forehead face and jaw allow the muscles here to relax on your next out breath let that sensation dissolve lower your focus to the neck letting the throat and sides and back of the neck soften notice any sensation that arises on the surface of the skin or deeper within now bring your attention to your shoulders noticing if there's any tension or strain breathe into your shoulders and if any parts feel tight allow them to relax extend your awareness down the arms towards the wrists palms and fingers on the next out breath allow them to soften now come to the chest observing the rise and fall of each breath notice how the lungs expand and contract direct your attention to your upper and lower back there may be some intensity is this is an area where we commonly hold stress if you notice any tension or warmth or discomfort just observe what's there with each breath you take soften just a little bit more moving your focus around your abdomen notice it expanding filling up with air and slowly emptying on the exhale and bring your attention to your pelvis notice where your body makes contact with the ground or your chair and direct your breath into this area relaxing into stillness now scan your legs observing your thighs notice where they make contact with your cushion or chair lowering your attention to your knees and your shins and calves let your legs soften intentions release when you're ready breathe into your ankles your feet and toes let them relax and become soft sinking into a state of relaxed awareness and as we near the end of the session take a moment to notice how you feel you may find that you're more relaxed as this is often a common outcome of meditation this is one of the reasons why it's so helpful to meditate during times of stress when we're experiencing stress our amygdala fires up and it's difficult to make thoughtful decisions so if we find our mind is clouded due to overwhelm we can use meditation as a tool to calm the mind down ideally we want to meditate in a preventative way so we don't get to that point the practice is here for you whenever you need it and as we near the end of the session bring your attention back to the room wiggle your fingers and toes and slowly open your eyes i hope you enjoyed today's daily con i invite you to bring this state of peace with you into the day and we'll see you back here tomorrow you
0 hey dear love if you're experiencing negative thoughts that's okay allow yourself to be okay with the not okayness and with that energy around you give yourself permission to get into whatever position feels comfortable for you and when you feel ready gently close your eyes turn your awareness towards your breath i really want you to focus on your belly throughout this meditation allow your lower abdomen to expand on every inhale and contract on every exhale all the while allowing your upper chest to remain relatively calm still and neutral this helps signal to our body that we are safe it's okay to slow down it's also okay to listen to whatever quote unquote negative thoughts that are going on within you because truly the only way to release them is to love them you don't need to love the thoughts so much as love yourself through the thoughts a simple example before we begin the practice is to not think about the color green [Music] what happens when i tell you to not think about the color green [Music] very often when we're told not to think of something or we try to not think of something we just think about it more [Music] when we instead shift our focus [Music] that's when we can start to change but it all begins with acceptance and love so whatever the key prominent negative message that has been coming up for you is present simply let it be as you turn into your breath remember stomach expands on every inhale and contracts on every exhale let yourself know that you are not this thought and it's okay that it showed up all of our quote unquote negative thoughts are actually just teachers in disguise so recognize if only for a moment you are separate from this thought imagine that it is just a scared wounded part of your own child-like self and extend love towards it for whatever piece of you had this thought is likely tied to some scared wound within a frightened inner child show love and compassion towards yourself for whatever you're feeling tied to these negative emotions let yourself know you are here for yourself you are here to love and accept yourself no matter what thoughts come to mind no matter what emotions are caused by the thoughts and vice versa you've got your back loving yourself in this way may bring about an emotional reaction of some kind simply allow whatever you experience if it feels good to you you may even embrace yourself wrapping your arms around yourself [Music] letting yourself know it's okay you're here for you you love and accept yourself no matter what thoughts or emotions are present you're not here to push them away you're not here to judge them or beat yourself up for them you are here to love yourself through them [Music] as you offer up this love and acceptance towards whatever thoughts are present again if there's multiple select just one right now for the purpose of this next step that negative thought is [Music] tune in to what emotions it may bring up for you if your arms are still wrapped around you you may choose to keep them there or let them come back down to your sides trust whatever feels best to you [Music] and as you let yourself be present with both this thought and emotion you allow yourself to get clear on what its opposite would be for example a common negative thought i've experienced is that i'm not good enough [Music] and the emotions accompanying our despair and doubt the opposite would be that i am good enough i am more than enough and the emotions would be trust optimism practice this with yours identify what the opposite of your negative statement is now identify what the opposite of your negative emotions are [Music] now now that you know this new positive statement and feeling you can recognize that those those emotions those statements we were referring to as negative were actually just teachers guiding you back towards this desire you have a desire to feel the way that you just identified [Music] we don't have negative thoughts about things we don't care about they're just showing us where we really care about something [Music] tune into that positive statement you just created the opposite of the negative statement you started with [Music] if it feels good to you say this new statement out loud [Music] if possible make it an i am statement [Music] how do you feel saying this if it still does not quite feel true you can say i am willing to believe followed by your new statement give that a try i am willing to believe link fill in the blank with your new positive statement notice how this willingness to shift into this new positive statement feels as you start to make this shift into more positive thoughts you gain momentum thereby attracting even more positive thoughts anytime you feel yourself slipping into thoughts that are perhaps considered more negative be grateful towards them for their only being guide posts showing you where you are able to look more closely at your desires in fact take the initial negative thoughts that you switched in this practice and begin to feel gratitude towards it it helped you identify this new desire this new positive affirmation you also start to extend gratitude towards yourself for you showed up as an alchemist today you sat in your power and transformed fear to love say thank you to yourself for this if it feels good to you you may give yourself another warm embrace and you can return to this process over and over again with any unwanted thoughts you are fully capable of transforming them into gold [Music] take this feeling with you as you begin to roll your shoulders wiggle your fingers and toes really focusing on this new positive statement and when you're ready slowly open your eyes back to the world around you amazing job today it's so powerful to look at your fears with love be proud of yourself for doing this and know that we are proud of you too and we're so thankful to you for being here we so hope this served if you feel cold share your new positive statement below and we can all hold space for the positive statements see you in the next meditation you
0 thank you for being here dear soul i'm kenneth and from my heart i welcome you to this guided meditation you can make yourself as comfortable as you can right now in this moment allow yourself to just be here and now observing the words i share with you like a soft breeze on a summer night noticing whatever it is that you notice your body may begin to relax more and more as you listen to my voice and go deeper within trust that your body can find its best way to let go naturally don't need to relax it may be that your body needs to heal in other ways it's good to know that your unconscious mind is an expert in healing and balancing in a safe and natural way while you can just flow with the experience change is a natural aspect of life like a tree that lets go of its leaves the seasons changing the sea changing from liquid to air [Music] and become aware of your breathing imagine now that you're breathing in that life energy through the soles of your feet breathing it up through your body and breathing out the top of your head breathing in through the soles of your feet breathing out the top of your head and out of your fingertips and some people notice that life energy like a tingling sensation or numb sensation in their feet or in their hands or fingertips [Music] there is no right or wrong way to flow with this experience there is an old story about a buddha statue perhaps your arms and feet will get heavier as you listen to this story and you can enjoy that in your own way because people can you know experience a pleasant deepening sense of comfort as they allow their body to relax and they relax deeply in the mid 50s a monastery was to be relocated to make room for a new highway the monks arranged for a crane to come and move a 10 feet tall clay buddha to its new location when the crane started to lift the statue it was much heavier than expected and it began to crack wanting to protect the priceless shrine the monks lowered it back down and decided to wait until the next day to bring more powerful equipment to add insult to the injury the rain came in so the monks covered the statue with tarps to keep the moisture away in the dark of night the head monk took his flashlight and went out to make sure the buddha was still covered when the light of the flashlight shone into the crack of the clay he saw a glimmer a reflection of something underneath the shroud of clay he immediately started to carefully chisel away shards of clay to find that the glimmer grew brighter hours later when all the clay had been removed he was in the presence of a buddha made of solid gold as you continue to listen the positive and valuable words i will share with you now have already started to activate a process of chiseling away old clay of worries fear stress and anxiety in your subconscious mind and this will continue with every second and every minute with every breath now i wonder if you can imagine yourself walking on a warm beach this can be any beach you like either one you imagine or a beach you know you are there by yourself imagine walking so close to the sea that some of the waves touch your feet i don't know what you notice the most if it's the sound of the waves maybe it's the sight of the sea the sky the sand or maybe it's the warmth the feeling of sand and water on your skin or maybe it's that fresh clean and high vibrational air or a combination suddenly you realize that there is a thick rope tied around your waist behind you at the end of the rope there is a big old anchor that weighs heavy from accumulated thoughts worries and fears from the past and about the future they hinder you they have held you back berated you from inner peace and harmony from joy and freedom the rope is going into your skin with each step in front of you now further ahead something glimmering in the sand catches your attention you walk towards it dragging that heaviness with you when you come closer to it you realize that it is a blade it looks and feels like it is from ancient times like there is an energy link between you and that blade [Music] and suddenly you notice your name appears on the handle of that blade while a part of you is curious your higher self knows that this blade is here for a reason like life has given you an opportunity chance a choice to deliberately cut the rope and let it all go cut the rope now let go of all the worries and unwanted feelings you've been dragging with you [Music] maybe you feel a sense of relief a sense of freedom lightness or something else maybe your body is working through this in its own way some people even shed tears and shake a bit when they finally let go the way you go through this is the way that is right for you and it is safe for you to let go now imagine the waves crashing into the anchor as it starts to magically rust to pieces right before your very eyes it is safe for you to let go now the anchor disappears more and more with each new wave the rope dissolves while it floats further and further from shore imagine the sun surrounding you with a radiant light energy shining down enveloping you filling you with a peaceful silence and quietness which flows through your veins permeating every cell in your body feel every atom every molecule of your body mind and spirit allowing yourself to be healed and balanced becoming very aware of that deep sense of peacefulness inside you as you do so and i'll leave you in silence for a few moments as your body mind heart and spirit continues the process of letting go and heal and you're doing good [Music] the sun is communicating these compassionate words with every atom every molecule of your body mind and spirit you can feel calm now and balanced and this calmness and sense of balance is going to grow and grow each day more and more more focused peaceful and calm while your subconscious mind is enjoying and absorbing all the beneficial suggestions that i am giving you in a safe and natural way and you're doing doing good you are taking control of your mind body and emotions you are feeling better and better feeling calm harmonious relaxed at all times that calmness that inner peace is growing and spreading through and around your body and as you continue to relax the things in life that were not giving you a positive experience now they seem to calm you now they seem to make you stronger now they seem to connect you with your inner strength and power whatever you experience in life you are bigger than that you are a part of something much bigger than yourself you choose to show up in your life and honor the opportunity that you have been given you are pure life force in human body you are life you are worthy [Music] that you start walking forwards along the beach leaving footprints in the sand the sun still beaming its powerful celestial energy upon your being you feel surprisingly more free imagine that every step every footprint represents patterns that are not supportive of your intention to live your full potential [Music] and it is safe for you to let go now let go now so you walk steadily and courageously towards your new future after a while you turn around maybe you notice that your footprints are being washed away by the waves your first steps are gone now washed away [Music] let go now and it is safe and you're doing good good for each step you take the lighter and more free you feel walking more and more effortlessly towards your new future much more free ahead of you there is a person approaching it is you it is you one month from now notice how relaxed that future you feels notice how good that future you feels that balanced energy is emanating from that you over there the future you comes towards you and gives you the warmest most compassionate hug that you have felt in a long time all that love that love unconditionally flowing between you the future you says thank you thank you for taking care of me i love you thank you for being so compassionate to me thank you for loving me and accepting me for who i am [Music] the effect of these positive words will be reinforced in your dreams compounded in your sleep you'll wake up tomorrow feeling marvelous looking forward to another great day in your life you feel confident to do all the things you want to do and it's getting easier and easier and situations that used to bother you now they just seem to make you stronger they seem to connect you with your inner power and it's getting easier and easier you are understanding the bigger picture and you detach more and more and relax more and more you are the calm one the confident one the positive thinker in any situation you feel good you feel calm you feel relaxed and you're doing good you always find surprisingly good solutions and your ability to conquer challenges is limitless your potential to succeed is infinite you can feel that inner power and harmony now to do the things you want to do and this inner power is growing when you sleep in your dreams you feel calm strong confident and relaxed each day as you become increasingly more able to let go and relax so you feel a sense of calmness a sense of peacefulness growing inside you and this growing feeling of inner calmness and quiet confidence is sufficient to reassure you that as each day passes you are more and more becoming the person you'd like to be the ideal you the authentic you you are worthy you are a believer in yourself you are more than good enough you are valuable you are important you are worthy you

0 thanks for joining me today for another mindful tip today i want to chat about stress a little bit you probably at some point in your life have experienced stress anxiety maybe panic maybe sensations of air hunger freak out whatever you want to call it and if you have it you probably know someone that has stress is really important to our physiology it's something that we actually rely on to survive in many ways unfortunately in today's world the mechanisms around stress can can backfire in some way so what used to help us stay alive can often you know the same elegant mechanism designed for that can backfire and kind of disregulate our nervous system so you know acute stress is really useful but over time chronic stress even if it's a low grade can really disregulate our autonomic nervous system and that could influence our breathing patterns and what happens is once our breathing pattern is affected negatively it could kind of feed back into that loop meaning now that you're not breathing uh optimally that leads to more chronic stress because breathing poorly whether it's you know your mechanics of breathing or like how many breaths you take in a minute or so forth though that in itself can be a stress and can kind of feed that loop now the cool thing is is we we could interact with that mechanism somewhat simply so today i wanted to give like one style of breathing that i find really useful from an application standpoint in everyday life now the breath pattern i'm gonna talk about today there's they're styles that have been used that tap into the same mechanism for a really long time so if you study yogic breath patterns you know a lot of them cultivate the same qualities that this does but sometimes to really practice those thoroughly you want to be in a fairly controlled environment you want to be sitting still in a room you want to have probably no responsibilities on your calendar for the next 20-30 minutes whereas what i'd like to talk about today i feel can be inserted into your life a lot easier uh more often for less amount of time so the application um you know really presents an opportunity for us when we're trying to navigate the stresses especially acute stresses of our life especially if you tend towards like anxiety panic and sometimes feelings or sensations of air hunger like you can't get enough breath oftentimes what happens when we feel that way we can make things worse by breathing faster or deeper everybody's heard the term you know relax take a deep breath and in some ways that could be helpful but there's also ways where that deep breath if it's rapid can exacerbate our situation so this pattern probably falls under the style of buteyko breathing that you might be familiar with and if you're not i definitely recommend a deep dive in that realm and it taps into one of the qualities that i think is important to develop and kind of it's important muscle to flex and that would be carbon dioxide tolerance so carbon dioxide is often thought of as like a waste product that's not useful to us but it's actually really important when dealing with anxiety or stress and carbon dioxide is a excuse me i got some critters behind me making noise carbon dioxide is a signaling molecule that our body relies on it plays a role in regulating the ph of our body and in doing so it signals our body's release of oxygen from hemoglobin into our tissues so oftentimes when we're breathing poorly because we're stressed or if we're stressed because we're breathing poorly we'll have a sensation like we're not getting enough air and sometimes that means because our oxygen is low and our carbon dioxide is high but in building tolerance to that level of carbon dioxide we can shift those sensations so we could shift the experience that we have in the moment to what we feel like we're not getting enough air to a place where we feel calm and that our breathing is not a problem it's kind of a fascinating concept that seems contradictory at first until you try it and some folks will struggle when trying this at least at first but it works it's really great i personally have relied on it many times and i think it's an important tool to have in our tool kit when things just arrive in our day-to-day situation where we notice that you know our breathing is off and we're and we're feeling stressed and on the edge of anxiety or panic the idea here in general is to slow down your breath to take fewer breaths and the way i like to do this and the way i've taught many folks where they could successfully integrate it is by first focusing on the inhale so as you're inhaling to try to take in your breath slower so the tendency might be to breathe more and to breathe faster so that you can breathe more but to actually do the opposite which could feel uncomfortable at first and what you're looking to do is kind of flirt with this edge of discomfort where it's a little uncomfortable but you can do it and if at any point it's too uncomfortable you could take a deep breath breathe naturally and kind of reset and start over but think of your breath being like a wave where you have an inhale and an exhale and the idea here is to slow down that inhale maybe not take as much air and then let your exhale kind of drag out and some folks will even try to create a little breath hold at the end of the exhale which is useful but not necessary so a good place to start if you want to apply structure so you have something to focus on like a count what i recommend would be to breathe in for a count of three and out for a count of three and very quickly let the exhale become longer so maybe your desire would be to breathe in for four or five but like slow that down don't take as much air in and then try to relax the body on the exhale so you're taking that wave and you're making it smaller in height essentially and stretching it out so the goal would be to eventually take fewer breaths over a given amount of time by slowing them down one thing that also might help focusing on this is the sound that your breath makes generally if you take a deep or fast breath it'll have an audible sound that you could hear from i don't know from the inside of your head somewhere so think of breathing where it doesn't really make a sound so slowing it down where there's not a lot of wind your breath is creating and not a lot of sound that it's generating so very slow soft inhale and then on the exhale over your breath cycles allowing that to drag out longer and longer and what i like to do on that exhale is try to relax my body so maybe starting with the stomach somewhere that feels somewhat central to where the activity of the breath is and relaxing it maybe relaxing the belly maybe relaxing the neck or shoulders if there's an area that you know you have a tendency of holding tension maybe focusing on relaxing that area on the exhale and if you can get to a point where you're in for three and maybe out for 9 or 10 or 12 which might take a few sessions to to get to what i find happens is within a fairly short period of time the way your nervous system feels like it's being expressed it just transforms so you can go to a place that you know you're on edge you're stressed right now in this moment feeling sensations of anxiety right now and within just a few minutes um really coming out to a different place where that sensation has really diminished which is an exciting thing it's like another example of what role we could play in our sense of well-being now this could be done really in any position i think because of the nature of how this is just slowly incorporated you can do this while you you're walking uh you know you're on a walk you can do it seated um i would maybe be careful doing it when driving but you know it could be integrated in a lot of different positions like wherever your orientation is it could even be played with during light levels of exercise movement if you're having difficulty doing it especially if you have the tendency of really breathing up here where your sternum and your shoulders are lifting on your inhale and you struggle with getting your breath to go more south in direction the thing the position that i feel is most useful would be laying prone meaning laying on your belly and what that does is it allows gravity to the weight of your body to kind of hold your rib cage in place a little bit so that you're there's there's a lot of movement in your ribs when you breathe but ideally it's not so much north it's more east west so when you're laying on your belly the weight of your body can hold your sternum in place a little bit and it allows it easier to direct your breath more downward and expand more laterally so if you find yourself having trouble with this from a seated or standing or walking position then just just lay down especially in the moment if you're in a moment where you're really experiencing anxiety and you want to see what you're capable of doing don't worry about trying to do it in a more i don't want to say advanced but you know while you're doing something else just lay down on your belly you could just put one hand on top of the other put your forehead on your hands or maybe if it's more comfortable turn your head to the side and put a cheek on your hands and just focus on slowing your inhale and then letting your exhale get longer and longer every cycle and trying to relax your body on that exhale it's a very effective pattern i encourage you to give it a try practice it when you're not in a place of anxiety or stress so that you feel a little bit more comfortable and then see if you could remember in the moment where you are experiencing uh increased stress or anxiety you know you could say oh i know what to do now i've practiced this and then go for it and then please let the community know what you notice so maybe in the comments you know give it a try and let us know what what you experience when you practice this pattern and if you want to learn more about different styles that tap in to these concepts the school of book tako breathing is an excellent resource and it's not hard to find information or videos about that so i hope you enjoyed this uh this tip and if you know someone that experiences anxiety and stress on a regular basis

(gentle meditative music) I'd like to invite you to gently close your eyes and take a nice, slow, deep breath in, deeper than you've taken all day so far. And as you exhale, concentrate on the sound of my voice, allowing it to ground you into the present moment. And give yourself permission right now to focus on you, making yourself your first priority. There's nowhere else you need to be. There's nothing else you need to be doing, except giving yourself this time for your own care, for your own well-being. Continue breathing, allowing each inhale to be a bit deeper than the one before it, feeling your lungs expand out as you inhale, and feeling everything contract back in as you exhale. Returning your breath now to its normal pattern and its normal rhythm, but continue to follow the journey of your breath through your entire body. Feeling it weave in and out of your muscles and your cells. Allowing it to still you, and ease any tension or tightness you may be feeling. Now I'd like you to turn your attention to the bottom half of your body, everything from your hips all the way down to the tips of your toes. Breathing into them. Noticing any judgments that come up about any of these areas. We all have parts of our body that we wish were different, but instead of judging them, now turn your focus to sending love and appreciation into these areas. Shifting your focus now to your upper body, from your stomach to the crown of your head, feeling into these areas, noticing any tension or tightness you may be having, breathing into that area to help it release. Noticing any judgments that come up in these areas. And gently, replacing that judgment with love and appreciation. And now begin to call to mind other parts of yourself that you've held in judgment in the past, maybe a thought pattern or a behavior you exhibited. Maybe it was a choice you made, or something you said you wish you could take back. Maybe a time where you felt you could have handled something better. Look at it from a place of total curiosity. Watch the judgment come up, because it will, and watch the stories that you've told yourself about the situation come up, because they will, too. And then gently let those go, and offer yourself forgiveness, knowing that you were doing the best you could at that time. And now as we move into the silent part of the meditation, continue this journey on your own, calling to mind any parts of yourself that you hold in judgment, and giving them unconditional love, acceptance, and forgiveness. Continue breathing with your eyes closed. Let your attention start to focus back on my voice. When we judge parts of ourself, we actually hold them separate from us, and if we're holding parts of ourself separate, then we can't feel whole. Real self love is holding our light with the dark, of loving those parts of ourselves unconditionally we previously held in judgment. No one else can do this for us. Give yourself all the love that you need. It's inside you. Now let's take three more deep breaths together, a deep inhale in, holding it for a beat, and exhale it out. Again, an even deeper breath than the one before, feeling that breath weave in and out of all of your muscles and cells. And exhale out. Last time, your deepest breath yet, sending that oxygen all the way down to the tips of your toes, and as you exhale, feel it traveling back up your body, and when it hits the top of your head, and you're ready, you can open your eyes. Thank you for joining me for this meditation and giving yourself this gift.
0 Hello and welcome to this healing session for anxiety.  Get into a comfortable and relaxed position and just let go of all your daily stresses.  Allow yourself to just be here and now, letting your body just be.  You don't have to do anything because our bodies naturally want to be calm and relaxed.  Sometimes thinking too much or being tense and being anxious doesn’t allow for us to relax.  So naturally, we must let go of any need to control the present moment and future outcomes.  We feel anxious because we tend to over-analyze what we think will happen today, tomorrow or next week.  We do this out of habit because in the past, situations and outcomes that didn’t happen the way we expected, and we tend to feel that we need to be in control and be worried.  In order to change this habit, we must change our self-image and create new beliefs.  That's what this session will teach you, but first, we need to get in a relaxed state and go within, calming our mind with some breathing.  I will count down and with it number I say I want to fully inhale with your belly out and exhale tightening your belly.  And with each breath, you will feel more and more relaxed, taking you into a deep state of peace.  I will count down now.  5...Take a full in breath and as you exhale feel the tension loosen a little bit.  4...Take a nice deep breath in and as you exhale you feel even more relaxed and tensions let go.  3...Full breath in...and out.  Your mind is becoming calm and clear.  2...Inhale deeply and when you exhale observe how the need to control subsides as you become extremely relaxed.  1...As you take your last breath and exhale slowly you feel any tension is gone, and you are in complete peace and tranquility.
0 So, to reduce anxiety, start by taking a moment to relax your body.. soften any unnecessary tension in your belly and shoulder, and find a posture that feels both relaxed and alert.  Now close your eyes or look downwards and rest your hands in an easy effortless way.  Take a few moments to scan your awareness through the sensations of your body, and wherever possible, soften and release obvious areas of physical tension.  Relax your breath, and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. This may be a little unfamiliar, but when done is a natural, easy going way, it can be a very relaxing way to breathe.  In through your nose and out through your mouth.  In through your nose and out through your mouth.  Now let your belly be soft. If the belly is soft, more oxygen goes to the bottom of the lungs.  There’s better oxygen exchange.  Oxygen moves more easily into the blood, and it goes to all the cells in the body, including the cells in the brain, supplying your brain with the nourishment it needs.  If the belly is soft, it helps to activate the vagus nerve.  Vagus means wandering, and this nerve wanders up through the abdomen and chest, back to the central nervous system in the brain, and it promotes relaxation.  It is an antidote to the fight or flight stress response.
0 the idea of being in the present moment is a powerful one when it comes to anxiety depression and calming an overactive mind depression can arise when thinking about and living in the past anxiety can show up when thinking about and living in the future when your thoughts are in the past or the future an overthinking mind can bring turmoil to your world and your overall experience today release these feelings calm the overactive mind and experience peace in this present moment this mindfulness meditation can be used to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past and anxieties about the future hello and welcome I'm Sara Raymond here at the mindful movement we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing let's begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable feel free to sit or lie down so you can experience ease yet remain alert we will start this meditation with your eyes open with a soft gaze focus your line of vision on one point in front of you this can be a spot on the floor or the wall whatever draws your attention narrow your focus on this one single point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away see all there is to notice about this one point now slowly broaden your field of view like a camera lens widening with a relaxed awareness notice everything you can see in your current line of you without turning your head notice colors textures different materials and now slowly narrow your field of view once more to the same single point that you started with and as your focus continues to narrow draw it in until your eyes gradually closed and you allow your attention to turn inward [Music] as you begin to look inside and settle physically start with three deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth like a sigh take these three breaths at your own pace welcoming a slowing down of the momentum of your energy to gradually find stillness [Music] now begin to count your breath in then as you breathe out encourage your exhale to be one count longer than your inhale [Music] allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress and tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will slow and your body will calm down [Music] you can consciously relax do this for a few more breaths cycles on your own now enjoy the easy flow of your natural breath feel the cool air as it passes in through your nostrils and fills you up [Music] encourage each natural out-breath to release any remaining tension you may be feeling as you observe your breath you can allow it to naturally slow down become aware of your physical experience [Music] with your minds I notice first the palms of your hands notice the energy here perhaps you feel this as warmth or tingling or a buzzing sensation notice how simply moving your awareness to this part of your body moves your energy to this point by simply paying attention you have the ability to move energy and move a positive sensation within you similar to broadening your visual focal point begin to widen the experience of your sensations outward moving from your hands to awaken to the sensations in your body since the aliveness in your hands and in your feet feel the energy moving within you let your attention drift through the sensations in your body without directing it and without judging what you find and by you're moving attention on your body to direct your energy and your thoughts simply allow your focus to tune into the sensations of your body right here right now [Music] when you can do this live in this body since your own aliveness you are in the present and living in the space between your thoughts when your mind is attentive to the sensations of your body you can pause you can extend the gap between your thoughts in this space is where you can experience peace and calm [Music] notice if there is anywhere you can soften a little more look for anywhere you can let go even deeper into relaxation and ease let your physical body go so that you can let your thoughts go and now as I say each part of your body let your focus move to each part and encourage or release a complete relaxation to find ease in your body by simply moving your awareness throughout your body as I mentioned each part allow the surface below you to support you fully so there is no need to hold your position and you can be completely relaxed become aware of your feet notice this area and simply relax move your attention up from your feet and begin to release your lower legs and knees feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and goes deeper into relaxation as you allow it to let go and now find a sense of ease in your thighs and hips as you let go completely moving up noticing the area of your lower back and abdomen take a deep breath to move your energy and attention here to release any tightness in your lower back continue this process of increasing your comfort by moving your attention and therefore your energy as you do this welcome a feeling of softening into your abdomen let your chest and arms rest heavy on the surface below you moving your attention upward feel as your neck and throat release any physical and emotional tension you may be holding on to notice now the hinges of your jaw allow your jaw to unclench relaxing deeper and deeper still feel as the small muscles of your cheeks eyes and forehead soften and they go you may notice that as the small muscles in your face and jaw let go the rest of your body follows and softens even more still now your whole body is heavy relaxed and that ease you may sense that you are safe and supported and you are open to guiding yourself into a calm state of mind let yourself go let your mind and body go to a deep and relaxed State [Music] and now that you are fully relaxed you can begin the inward inquiry process by checking in with what is true for you notice what you are actually feeling giving yourself permission to experience in this present moment without trying to change anything let your thoughts come and go there is no need to attach to them or follow your thoughts imagine your thoughts are like a river flowing gently downstream let your thoughts go so you can be here now awake to the sensations in your body let your thoughts go so you can make room for the truth to surface in whatever form a comes simply allow it to surface make space for awareness and acceptance without judgment [Music] whatever you're feeling is okay these are simply patterns that have developed they are not you recognize any self talk going on in your mind and let your thoughts come and go allow yourself to move out of the thinking patterns and bring your attention to your felt experience no need to attach words or labels to your feelings simply explore what those feelings are pause and allow these feelings give yourself permission to be with this experience but your thoughts come and go [Music] if you find your mind drifting going back to old patterns of thinking or overthinking lovingly guide yourself back gesture your attention to come back to the present moment sensations once more being present is the way stay in the moment stay with the feelings and be okay with it continue to make space in your heart for whatever you are feeling and simply be stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment longer let your thoughts come and go continue to come back to the felt experience and move out of the thinking patterns and then take some time to nurture yourself place your hand on your heart if you like and offer love and kindness to yourself open your heart and let it in offer a positive energy to the area of your heart begin to deepen your breath once more allow your deepening breath to nurture yourself with care and compassion since an inner peace pause for just a moment longer to truly experience the positive sensations that are always within you when you are willing to slow down and look within when you slow down and stay with the sensations as long as you can you may find that you notice more you are able to live more fully without letting thoughts take over now as many times as you can look for what wants to be seen listen to what wants to be heard to do this slow down pause look inward look in between your thoughts quiet your thoughts to see hear and feel deeply inhabit your body fully and be open to life begin to reactivate each part of your body from its relaxed state feel the gentle refilling of energy back into your body awaken your body slowly and when you are ready open your eyes take this calm state with you as you go on with your day thank you so much for practicing with me I hope you have a peaceful day

of your energy to gradually find stillness begin to connect with your breath and if it feels right to you take a long slow deep breath in hold it for a moment and then slowly exhale fully empty out and allow any tension to melt away as you gradually relax more and more deeply with each breath as you continue to breathe intentionally allow your exhale to be slightly longer than your inhale to welcome ease and relaxation to flow throughout your entire body [Music] take another long slow deep breath in pausing again and then exhale empty your lungs completely with your out-breath [Music] and again take a deep breath in to signal to your body and mind that it is your time to fully relax take your time hold for a moment and then let it go perhaps you can already feel yourself drifting into a deep state of relaxation like the leaves being released from the trees in the season of fall you can let go to make room for new possibilities to develop and present themselves in your life [Music] consider each breath out as a time for releasing any unwanted energies and allowing the energy that you do desire to develop within you this is your time to heal and to let go with each exhale let go of any tension in your body scan for areas that are holding on to something and give yourself permission to let go of that tension with each exhale surrender to gravity let go of any resistance [Music] with each exhale let go and soften deeper and deeper into the surface below you allow your body to soften a little deeper now allow the out-breath to exhale tension from your body we'll let go of anything you might be holding on to from yesterday or earlier today [Music] let go of any to-do list that may be taking up space in your ID give yourself permission to be here right now doing just this sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission in order to let go of the past give yourself some space space for something new space to grow into what do you want to let go of right now [Music] what has become too heavy a weight to bear on your journey [Music] like the falling leaves it's time to clear out and free yourself of things you may have been afraid to let go of in the past without the falling of the leaves there can be no new growth let go of anger let go of guilt let go of grief [Music] let go of sadness let go of judgments let go of comparisons let go of

is you can allow yourself to simply be exactly as you are [Music] a peaceful mental state and an ease fulfill state are available when you are able to stop resisting your experience at any given moment when we want things to be different than they are that is when we develop resistance or tension today practice letting go of resistance be here now just as you are and you can get into the flow [Music] as you notice your body sensations accept them just as they are whether you may typically label these sensations as positive or negative settle into your body except being in your body right now just as you are be with the sensations you experience accepting all that you are there is no need to make a change during meditation be just as you are accepting allows you to fully experience what is happening in the present to fully engage in life [Music] listen to what your soul is sharing with you right now continue to be receptive to these sensations for a few moments longer with love and kindness for yourself feel the lightness that has washed over you as you have shed the weight that you have been carrying around for far too long we can learn from our faults and grow from our experiences if we allow them know that without experiencing suffering we also cannot experience joy without darkness we cannot know light allowing life just as it is can lessen any struggle and perhaps any additional and unnecessary suffering continue to soften soften from the surface all the way to deep within you release any guarding you may be holding on to surrender to anything you were holding on to for fear of losing let go of what could have been let go of worry of the possibility of a new way let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders let the sensations dissolve from your muscles every day we get a new chance to be in this moment it is okay simply breathe and notice surrender to the ability of your body to heal itself surrender to the love within you know your ability

yourself to feel just as you are for an even deeper connection with yourself surrender to your breath feel your body being breathed being moved by your breath trust it's okay simply breathe and notice [Music] notice the sounds in your environment just as they are here are the sounds as they come to you without searching them out allow the subtle noises to drift into your awareness with simple curiosity take interest in the sounds just as they are simply allow the sounds to be rather than seeing them as a distraction or an obstacle if you can practice accepting the sounds just as they are without the desire to change you can also begin to practice acceptance and surrender in other areas of your life frequently the word surrender has a negative energy to it you may think of having to give up something that is important to you or lose control over a situation Surrender does not mean giving up when the word surrender is used as a mindfulness practice it can also be the opportunity to give up anything that is no longer serving you or anything that is keeping you stuck [Music] consider this beautiful quote by Debbie Ford surrender is a gift that you can give yourself it's an act of faith it's saying that even though I can't see where the river is flowing I trust it will take me in the right direction [Music] any obstacle or challenge in your life might actually be taking you in the right direction allow the flow of the energy of life [Music] when you feel life brings you challenges you can't accept you have the opportunity to be transformed by acceptance you may add suffering when you resist the way things are because they aren't the way you expect or want them to be [Music] you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the way things are naturally there is a possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true peace is available when you stop resisting any given moment [Music] although you don't have control of what goes on beyond yourself you do have a choice as to how you respond to your experience and this choice gives you the opportunity to experience in our peace you can decide your attitude in any given circumstance noticing the sensations in your body with a relaxed awareness once more since that you now feel as if the weight of tension has been lifted and released from your body you sense that you are feeling lighter now almost as if you are floating and gravity has let go of its effects on you [Music] this lightness comes from letting go of anything and everything weighing on you both physically and emotionally it has been lifted completely out of your body [Music] this release allows you to feel lighter physically and you drift into a more productive sleep to prepare you for the day ahead [Music] let go of tension [Music] let go of pain let go of negativity and make room for the rejuvenation of a deep night's sleep let this come to you easily and effortlessly in your mind here these positive affirmations as your own beliefs hear them as truth in this present moment let these statements move you towards a spiritual surrender allow these ideas to help you drift into a deep healing state you don't have to do anything simply listen and allow sleep to come easily to you eventually my voice will fade away and you will drift off into a deep healing state of sleep for many hours I am ready to release the past and move forward now [Music] I am ready to surrender and move forward now [Music] I surrender I allow I accept I surrender by giving up attachments to results

0 Just as you take food into your body, consuming both healthy and not-so-healthy options, you also consume media throughout the day.  You listen to music, watch TV, read the news, and so on.  Although these may provide knowledge and entertainment, they can also create anxiety and stress in our minds and bodies or take us away from our connection to the mind.  This exercise offers a few different ways to bring mindfulness to these moments of consumption.  They don’t necessarily need to be done step-by-step.  First, consider what the impact may be of what you are choosing to consume.  Are you reading the news to inform yourself, or to fuel frustration?  Perhaps the television show you watch has quite a bit of violence and gets your nervous system going.  This isn’t to label a show, story, or song as good or bad.  It’s merely about recognizing the effects of your choice.  As you consume the piece of media, notice the response of the mind and body.  If you are watching TV, mute the volume during commercials to check in with yourself.
0 Please find a sitting position that allows you to be alert, your spine erect but not rigid, and also relaxed.  Now close your eyes and rest your hands in an easy effortless way.  Take a few moments to scan through your body, and wherever possible, soften and release obvious areas of physical tension.  We begin the practice of coming back by establishing our home base.  While there are many possible anchors such as sound or sensations throughout the body, the most common and the one we’ll be exploring here is the breath.  Please breathe naturally and simply notice where the breath is easiest to detect and where the breath also feels pleasant or at least neutral.  So you might be paying attention to how the breath feels as it flows in and out of your nose, you might feel the touch of your breath around your nostrils or on your upper lip, or perhaps you feel the movement of your chest or the rising and falling of your abdomen, or perhaps you feel your whole body like a balloon expanding with the in breath, deflating with the out breath.  So just take some moments to bring your attention to the sensations of breathing in one of these areas, a relaxed attentiveness.  There’s no need to control the breath.  Rather, sense you’re receiving the breath much like you’d listen to sound.  With a relaxed awareness, discover what the breath is really like as a changing experience of sensations.

0 [Narrator] Hey there, I'm John, and welcome to our meditation. If you're having a hard time right now, it's okay, you are not alone and there is help. You can reach out to a loved one, a friend, a colleague or medical resources. If you're suffering from severe depression or having harmful thoughts, please reach out to your local suicide prevention resources. Links are in the description of this video. Go ahead and settle into a position you can comfortably hold for a while. Be gentle with yourself and honor what your body wants. And if you can, try to avoid a position you'd fall asleep in. Noticing your connection to your feet on the floor or your legs on the chair. Allow these to ground you down to the floor where it's still and solid. Place one hand on your heart and one hand on your lower belly. Close your eyes or let them gaze downward towards the floor gently. And inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, into your lower belly. And feeling the hand on your belly move outward as it fills with air. Mother hand on your chest remains gentle and still. Now slowly exhale all of the air out of your body as if you were blowing out candles on a cake. Feeling your belly contract back in. And again breathing deeply into your lower belly, feeling that inhale weaving in and out of your muscles and yourselves, nourishing your body, beginning to allow you to feel lighter, clearer, more still. And as you exhale, allow the breath to gently begin to carry away any sadness and depression or heaviness that you may be feeling. (uplifting music) Continue breathing slowly and deeply into your lower belly. Allowing your focus to remain on the rhythm of your breathing and the sensation of the expansion and contraction of your belly. And if you get distracted that's okay. Just return your attention back to your breath. Using it as your anchor for the rest of our time together, your inhales nourish and lighten you, and they steal you enough to see through the cloudiness and your exhales gently carry the heaviness, pain and negativity away which opens up space for ease and gratitude to come in. (uplifting music) Take some time now to sit with a lot of compassion and love for yourself. Depression can feel overwhelming and takes so much of our energy, but here and now, from this more still grounded space, you can give yourself all of the compassion you deserve and all of the love too. See if you can allow yourself to just be exactly where you are. And when judgment comes up, breathe into it with love and compassion. And let it gently float away, dissipating as it does. And see if you can let yourself become aware of a new feeling of stillness and ease of self love and of hope. (uplifting music) Remember in those times when the heaviness and cloudiness set in, you always have the capacity to return to this space to take care of yourself and love yourself exactly as you are, to wrap yourself in a big hug. There is hope, this will pass and you are not alone. (uplifting music ) Now let's take three more deep breaths together. Take a deep inhale in, holding it for a bit and exhaling it out. Again, an even deeper breath than the one before feeling it weave in and out of your muscles and yourselves. And exhale it out. The last time, your deepest breath yet, this time sending that oxygen through your entire body and when it reaches the top of your head and you're ready, you can open your eyes. (uplifting music)

0 Hello my loves welcome to a guided meditation for self love by Lavendaire I’m happy you made the choice to meditate today and give back to yourself. Let’s get into a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes. Rest your hands on your lap and face your palms up for receiving. Take three deep breaths with an open mouth exhale. Breathe deep into your lungs and your diaphragm, expand…. And then open mouth exhale and let it all out. Repeat two more times… take a deep breath into your belly, and open mouth exhale, and let it all out. Deep breath in….And exhale, let it all out. Take this moment to feel your body and focus on gratitude. What are you grateful for, right now? Feel the energy in your body, a body that works to keep you alive and functioning, without a second thought. A body that supports you and everything you want to do in life. Give this body acknowledgement and love, for all the miraculous things it does for you to keep you here, breathing. Now, focus on your breath for a moment. Isn’t it a wonder that your body knows how to breathe, continuously, without much effort or awareness? But once you shift your awareness to your breath, you become in control of the flow of your breath? Your awareness is powerful. Wherever your attention goes, energy flows. Use the power of your awareness to focus on your body, feeling your presence with each breath. Relax your eyebrows… Relax your brain… relax your shoulders... relax your heart… Relax your entire body.... Feel your body soften and relax. Know that you are safe in this moment. Your body is your shell and your home for this lifetime. Take good care of it. Give it love. Consider: What does self love mean to you? Self love is… accepting yourself, quirks and flaws included. Forgiving yourself, knowing it’s okay to make mistakes. Knowing your worth, standing tall and not feeling small or inferior to others. Loving yourself and your journey, knowing that you are both a work of art and a work in progress at the same time. And all of it is OKAY. Cultivating self love is learning to practice unconditional love for yourself… What does unconditional love mean? How does it feel to love yourself, unconditionally? No conditions.. Meaning: You don’t have to be anything other than yourself. You don’t have to prove yourself to anyone. You are already lovable and loved. You don’t have to try… You are already worthy of love. Feel how it would feel to love yourself, unconditionally… Now we’ll be reciting some positive affirmations to cultivate more self love. Feel free to repeat after me, in your mind. I accept myself exactly as I am. I love and embrace all of me. I am grateful for my body, and all that it’s doing to support me. All of me is beautiful. I am enough. I am worthy. I am a light in this world. My light is unique and incomparable to others. I respect myself and give myself what I need. Setting boundaries is an act of self love. I release all that is holding me back. I release all that does not align with my truest self. I am authentic to who I am and aligned with what I want. I choose love over fear. Come back to your breath. Feel the energy in your body… notice how you feel now, nourishing yourself with love. Remember this feeling, you can always come back to this. Now, we will use the power of visualization. Imagine the energy of love, surrounding you, surrounding your entire body. Feel the warmth of this loving energy envelop and hug your entire body. Love is all around you. Light is all around you. Breathe in… inviting that energy of love & light into you, through the crown of your head. Visualize that energy flow through you, down your entire body, nourishing yourself with unconditional love and light. As you breathe out, release all the negativity and fear that has held you back from pure unconditional love for yourself. Breathe in love… energy in through the top of your head, and breathe out.. Let that beautiful energy flow through you, pushing out all that doesn’t serve you anymore. Where light enters, darkness cannot stay. Continue this visualization as you gently breathe in… and out… breathing in love, and breathing out fear… Resetting and replenishing your energetic body with love and light. Begin to come back to your breath. Check in with your body, and your energy, and notice how you are feeling. You have given yourself so much love today. Continue this practice by nourishing yourself with love and acceptance, every single day. You are fully deserving of love, no matter what. You are already worthy, simply by existing. I hope you take this energy of self love into the rest of your day. The more love you have for yourself, the more love you will put out into the world. And thus, a better, more beautiful world we will create together. Sending you love & light, Namaste.
0 Let's begin by taking a moment to settle your body into a comfortable position (2 seconds).  You may close your eyes or keep them slightly open with a soft focus looking downward a few feet in front of you (2 seconds).  Allow your spine to lift and your shoulders to soften (2 seconds).  Today we will practice a body scan (2 seconds).  Taking a full breath in (2 seconds) and a long slow breath out (2 seconds).  Bring gentle awareness to the breathing (2 seconds).  Notice the in breath (2 seconds)  and out breath (2 seconds)  and spaces in between (10 seconds).  Bring attention to the top of your head, notice sensations or lack of sensations (2 seconds).   Move your attention down to the back of your head, the sides (2 seconds),  to your forehead (2 seconds), and face (5 seconds).  Move your attention to your neck (2 seconds), and your throat (2 seconds), and now shoulders.  Noticing what sensations you are aware of. Shift attention to your arms, upper arms, lower arms (2 seconds),  your hands (2 seconds), and fingers (2 seconds).  Bring your attention to your back, upper back (2 seconds),   down to the middle (2 seconds), and down farther to your lower back (10 seconds).
0 The body is always breathing, and the breath is constantly moving.  Your breath is not only the best place to start; it’s a constant you can return to anytime you need a little centering.  In this practice, you will gently find the breath in the body.  There is nothing to figure out, there are no problems to solve, and there’s nothing special you need to do.  Constantly return to your direct experience of the body breathing.  You are training the mind to be with one experience without distraction.  Find a comfortable position for the body.  Sitting is often recommended, as it helps keep the body awake and energized.  You can also try lying flat on your back, or standing.  You may sit on a yoga mat, meditation cushion, or chair.  Find what feels comfortable and sustainable for a few minutes of stillness.  Gently allow the eyes to close.  If you’re more comfortable with the eyes open, try softly gazing at the floor or ceiling (depending on your position).  Allow the eyes to relax and rest on one spot.  The idea is to minimize distractions in your practice.  Bring your awareness to the abdomen.  Relaxing the muscles there, see if you can feel the natural rising and falling.  Imagine the body is breathing itself.  From the navel around to the obliques, notice the movement with each breath.

0 No matter how much you try to think positive thoughts and be optimistic about the future, unpleasant thoughts will still arise.  You cannot avoid them, and there is no use in pretending they aren’t present.  Your mindfulness practice can help you approach these thoughts with curiosity.  As you build an understanding of your unpleasant thinking patterns, they will no longer hook you in so strongly.  You can learn to allow them to be present without letting them consume you.  This exercise is a practice in letting thoughts go so that you are better able to do it when negative thoughts arise.  Close the eyes and tune in to the points of contact in the body.  Feel yourself grounded and stable as you sit.  Breathe deeply, feeling the body supported by the chair or cushion.  Pay attention to the experience in your mind.  Notice any thoughts as they arise, and try to identify any emotions that go with them.
0 So, to reduce anxiety, start by taking a moment to relax your body, soften any unnecessary tension in your belly and shoulder, and find a posture that feels both relaxed and alert,  Rest your hands in an easy effortless way.  With your eyes open, take a few moments to scan your awareness through the sensations of your body, and wherever possible, soften and release obvious areas of physical tension.  Let your eyes stay open and focus on the middle of the room wherever you are.  And then see how you can let your awareness travel across the room from where you’re sitting.  If you’re lying down, you can let your attention go upwards to the ceiling.  And then notice how you can let your attention come back to the center of the room.  And see if you can bring your attention closer, to about book-reading distance as if you’re reading a book in your hands.  So clearly, you can determine where your attention goes.  And now you can let your eyes close and just let your attention go inward.  And gently focus on the sensations of the breath moving in and out of the body...  And you can let your attention go to wherever the breath comes most naturally to you.  For some people, it’s the sensations of the air in the nostrils , with that gentle feeling coming in and out as the air passes in and out at the nostrils.

climb [Music] the stone is smooth and cold to your touch continue to climb slowly there are many steps spiralling up ahead of you we're not afraid of the height it feels wonderful to be leaving all of your problems below as you walk cast a glance down at the small room below see many boxes large and small all of them filled to overflowing with your problems your anxieties and all of your regrets feel a sense of relief as you climb higher moving away from all the chaos the clutter and anxieties below with each step you move towards peace and inner contentment you are now approaching the top step and an inky blackness greets you as you emerge onto a circular Ward platform you note that the sky forms the roof and there are millions of stars twinkling in the black expanse there is a sudden rush of freedom feel the sense of wonder and horror as you look towards the Hamill's [Music] in the middle of the pure-white curved platform there is a circular flat seat sloping back into a contoured chair made out of the same marble as its surroundings sit and feel the coolness of the marble beneath you it is a perfect seat for reflection and you lean back feeling the stone supporting your back in the most perfect places it's as if it was carved with you in mind imagine that you are now looking up at the night sky there are no clouds to mask the Stars and they provide you with a vastness that is appealing a way to escape the tensions of everyday life in real life you may feel tense frustrated and even trapped by life's confinements but as you look up now into the depths of this extraordinary sky dotted with stars millions of stars light-years away you feel a sense of desire to float up high and to become one with the universe to feel weightless to gain a new and inspiring sense of perspective feel yourself begin to float gently out of the marble seat you move up even higher twisting your position around so that you can look around as you float higher you float up above the marble walls and now you can see the view of the city around you lights the twinkle far beneath the expanse of sky the view is magnificent you can see for miles the landscape lit by twinkling lights heralding the existence of those who live and share this reality with you a cityscape that comes to life with the sprinkling of artificial lights that mirror the heavens above you move effortlessly relishing in this feeling of freedom here you are cast afloat from the problems of daily life it is like flying but with no effort required a single thought enables you to change direction at will and you travel on you look down moonlight is reflected in the rippling waters of the estuary gentle waves lap at the shore and as you float out further high above the darkened waters boats Bob along the harbour walls and the feeling here is of complete peace and tranquility you feel invisible there is no blame here no regrets just or at being able to see life from a whole new perspective traveling over the estuary you head along the coastline scaling large cliffs flying high above them thin wispy clouds almost transparent from below are blown in from the sea hugging the cliffs as you move higher the clouds wrap themselves around you like gossamer threads the clouds wispy fragile and translucent follow in your trail as you saw ever higher rising vertically now higher and higher looking up towards the moon silvery gray the moon is for you marvel at its beauty and power knowing how it controls the ebb and wane of the tides he is suddenly life seems less complicated there is a sense of pureness of mystery and yet clarity life is good life is wonderful and you share a sense of connection with the universe breathing deeply and then release the breath letting go of any tension within your body instead focus on the softness of every muscle feel yourself loose relaxed and free from burden far below you low flying birds hug the surface of the water disturbed they seem tiny and fast moving the water ripples gently sparkling stars and the light from the moon Herald your way you see the world from an enlightened viewpoint and it is one of wonder here high above the fragmented clouds you feel a part of the world's mystery connected on every level and free from your problems you can sense a change around you gradually the air becomes warmer and misted as cloud formations begin to forge together the sky changes color dark muted through to light and for a while the Sun and Moon share a place in the heavens he dropped down now through the fluffy clouds thicker now and float down towards the Earth's surface you feel exalted as the see now mirrors the changing skies sparkling sunlight glinting across the surface and shimmers of blue you drift down moving on away from the water's edges still high above the city's architecture tall concrete pillars and homes reaching up towards the sky and small private residences alone surrounded by small patches of green like a complex jigsaw of life stone and irregular shapes all fitting together in an almost seamless ease marvel at how the man-made structures can look beautiful too here you can see that life is about living and not holding on to problems there is no place in your life anymore for anxieties that make you feel ill tension headaches regrets that nor away that cue or the decisions that you just can't make here in this weightless existence you realize that you can be free from all of the negative aspects of life no longer shackled by an existence that holds you back this acknowledgement is meaningful it has the power to change your life as you breathing deeply conjure up the image of those problems and all of the boxes that you left behind initially they were overflowing threatening in their power to hamper your life to impact you at every turn now picture them reduced in size no more threatening just minor inconveniences now that you have scaled them in your mind shrink the problems smaller still breathe deeply again and then out breathing out the last of your connections to those problems and visualize them growing ever smaller minut a fraction of their former size and you realize that your perspective was clouded before your judgement of center your realization of the truth in life and the importance of nature and your place in the world makes those problems seem insignificant by comparison [Music] focus again on your breathing inhaling as you open up the chest exhaling as you breathe out it is time to see the problems of life as mere obstacles it is time to look to the important things in life and to step away from any doubts regrets or anxieties that affect you negatively it is time to feel contentment and to embrace pure inner peace drift gently now down to earth close your eyes and feel your descent you are at peace with life and with yourself finally you understand your part within the universe drifting down bathed in golden light as the Sun shimmers in the early morning sky the faint warmth is comforting a beautiful start to the day it is time to feel positive about your life you have the power to do so you are centered you retain the feeling of peace and wonder you are now back in your own reality imagine that you are back in your bed comfortable safe and secure open your eyes and stretch out your muscles breathing deeply to send oxygen around your body realize how good you feel right now keep experiencing the wonderful sense of calmness and deep peace as you remember your wonderful high time above the clouds a part of the midnight sky and then a part of the early morning transition as night became day understand now that your problems are such a small part of time and space and even within your own reality understand that your problems can be dealt with quickly and clearly with clarity of mind breathing deeply and keep your sense of peace and tranquility breathe out slowly noting that no tension remains remember that you can return to this meditation whenever you need a renewed perspective you are one with the universe [Music]
0 welcome to a guided meditation for anxiety and depression on the clutter of the mind so let's start the practice by finding our seat you can sit on a chair or cushion on the floor [Music] and sit with your back upright but comfortable so before getting into the practice let's just start by acknowledging how we feel in this moment and we don't need to add a story to the way we are feeling we don't need to judge it or try to change it right now just be with it part of suffering is that we suffer that we suffer so we add thoughts or stories that only worsen what we're feeling mindfulness is an open awareness and acceptance of what we're experiencing in the moment whether it's good or bad so let's start here with acknowledgement and now let's start by taking in a few big deep breaths breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth and now close your eyes let's place our attention now on the breath start by noticing each inhale and exhale the sensations around each breath and where you notice the most maybe you notice the rising sensations in the chest or stomach maybe you notice the falling sensations around the body on each exhale and just be with the sensations follow the rhythm of each in breath and out breath with your full attention and as we do this thoughts may arise feelings may surface and this is part of the practice if you are experiencing anxiety and a bout of depression right now there will likely be thoughts and feelings that attempt to pull your attention away and when this happens notice it instead of resisting or changing it see if you can actually play with these thoughts and feelings here see if you can become welcoming of them and allow them to come and go before returning to watching the breath and if you find yourself following a thought or feeling with more thoughts or adding a story to them gently pull your attention back to the breath watching the sensations of breathing and as you watch the breath and continue to notice thoughts see if you can use the out breath to release any discomfort to release any unwelcome thoughts sending them out with the exhale so for the just that moment even if it's very brief the mind is empty and allow any feelings that come up to be acknowledged and sent out with the breath as well so that even for a brief moment you are emotionally still and quiet see if you can find those moments where just for a brief micro second you are without any anxiety or feelings of depression and when you get a glimpse of it it's tempting to seek it but we're not fabricating anything here or seeking it just allow these moments to come to you through mindfulness through watching the breath and resting in awareness and now let's shift our attention from the breath into the physical notice the contact that your body is making your feet on the floor your body against the chair your hands in the lap and notice your weight on the chair or on the floor as well and just be with the physical sensations for the next few moments and now in the final few moments of the practice just let go allow the mind to do what it wants and go where it wants and now open your eyes thanks for having the courage and will today to do this mindfulness practice and i'll see you next time

and welcome I'm Sara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are in Oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing enjoy the journey and now I invite you to make yourself comfortable turn off or tune out all distractions and commit to this time for yourself let go of your to-do lists and your responsibilities taking this time for you for self-care is a gift to enjoy you must first help yourself and love yourself before you can help or love anyone else when you feel ready close your eyes and bring your full awareness to your breath begin to count the length of your breath in then as you breathe out encourage your exhale to be one count longer than your inhale allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress or tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow and your body will calm down do this for a few breaths cycles at your own pace allowing each slow exhale to settle you into relaxation and stillness for this practice  now as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up as you breathe out this white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of stress  take a long slow deep breath in through your nose and now move your breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to just surrender as you exhale breathing out anything that no longer serves you each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even more deeply  now allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm know that your breath is an anchor or a reminder to be in the present moment know that you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment so you know you are always in the present moment when you are attentive to your breath your breath is a reminder to slow down and be present and this reminder is always with you  as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer notice your thoughts and you might acknowledge them by saying in your mind thinking by acknowledging the act of thinking you can let it go when your mind does wander simply come back to your breath and use this breath as an anchor or a reminder  you'll keep coming back any time your mind wanders as many times as you need [Music] as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and slow down  allow your body to soften and your breath to be calm know that your body responds to your thoughts so you can think about relaxing and ask your body for a release of tension your mind is so powerful and creating change in all aspects of your life and now invite your body to relax each muscle completely begin with the muscles around your eyes and your jaw by relaxing these muscles specifically the rest of your body knows exactly what to do and will relax in response continue to unclench your jaw completely and soften the muscles in and around your eyes as you begin to feel the familiar heaviness throughout your entire body all you have to do is think about relaxing and releasing the tension in your body and your body will respond because it listens to what your mind tells it  and now feel your entire body let go feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside know that your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you you are in complete control but for now your mind and body know it is time to relax and let go it is time to slow down right now all the sounds around you are unimportant and they simply add to your relaxation [Music] all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow your body to relax and your subconscious mind will do the job of clearing the clutter notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper you now allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go letting your body mind and spirit become one continuing to enjoy a peaceful and tranquil state begin to use your imagination and in your mind see yourself in front of a beautifully decorated glass elevator door this glass door is etched and frosted with the most amazing design on it in your mind you can see the beauty in this design  you can reach out and feel the texture with your fingers feel the cool temperature of the glass this elevator will take you down to the deepest part of your subconscious mind so that you can declutter your thoughts release tension and negativity and this will allow you to develop positive thoughts and a calm state of mind in your mind you see the door to this elevator opening and you step in to experience its spaciousness you know you are completely safe and you can see through the glass walls of the elevator you push the B button so that you can go down to the basement of your mind this elevator will lead you deep into relaxation each level will take you deeper down and in a moment as I count the elevator will take you down slowly into a more deeply relaxed state you will find that the deeper down you go the more comfortable and calm you will become the more easily connected to your deepest subconscious level you will become and now on the count of ten as the elevator begins its slow descent you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do 8 you know you are right where you need to be on your journey and you allow the outside world to just turn off 7 each level down takes you even deeper into a relaxed state 6 you feel yourself going deeper into relaxation deeper into a connection with yourself five you are halfway down letting go completely for going deeper and deeper into comfort  three almost to the basement of your subconscious mind to experiencing deep deep tranquility and one all the way down into the deep state of relaxation and peace and now you have reached the bottom the elevator doors slowly open and you walk out into the basement of your subconscious mind you take a look around and see that you have stepped out into what looks like a library you see that this space stores all of your memories as well as the possibilities for your future there are rows and rows of shelves throughout the entire room each shelf filled with many many books  as you look around you see books of all different sizes and colors take a moment to look around see the deepest part of your subconscious mind and what is stored here  you might notice some of the books are disorganized and there are areas of clutter around the floor in front of some of the shelves and as you see this you feel an intense desire to organize the books so that they are easily accessed when needed you feel a desire to clean up the clutter around the room and you know that by doing this you will organize and declutter your mind and your life  you realize that just by thinking about organizing and cleaning magically this room changes you recognize how powerful and brilliant your mind is the room automatically becomes well-organized and the clutter is cleared this change has simplified your life and with this change you feel a positive transformation within yourself you know that deep inside you a switch has been reset so that everything works in your favor you are now organized and decluttered in all areas of your life as well as your thinking mind you are easily able to generate support and inspiration for yourself  you enrich yourself mentally emotionally and spiritually you easily do all that it takes to actualize your goals to thrive and to live in alignment with your values and intentions from today forward you begin to take even better care of yourself you redefine yourself as a happy energetic light hearted person you feel like a physical weight has been lifted to allow you to be lighter and calmer you allow new and more empowered thoughts and inspired feelings of success healing and wellness to profoundly build within you you respect yourself showing yourself love kindness and compassion take a moment to let those positive qualities sink in  and now you let go of any negative thoughts that no longer serve you you let go of old outdated beliefs that may have helped you in the past but are now holding you back keeping you stuck you let go of any past negativities and you replace them with positive behaviors positive thoughts and feelings of gratitude you are aware of your thoughts and you have the ability to change from a negative thought to a positive one just by being aware you believe without a doubt that you are strong and confident in your life you see your past limiting beliefs and behaviors disappear to be gone for good [Music] self-doubt fear and anxiety are things of the past that cannot will not ever affect you again you replace these feelings with optimism confidence and an easily calm disposition you trust your instincts and your abilities you are easily able to accept things as they are knowing you are exactly where you are supposed to be on your journey take a moment longer to feel these positive words and beliefs as truth as they sink in to your mind  and now bringing your attention to the imagined room around you take one last look around at the organized and decluttered space of your subconscious mind know that this new organized space will translate to stress free anxiety free living in all aspects of your life  now in your mind begin to walk back towards the elevator see the doors slowly open and invite you in as you step into the elevator you have a strong sense that you can continue to experience this calm relaxed state in your life by continuing the process of simplifying and

0 when it feels like everything is out of your control seek to connect with what you do have control over your breath and your response to your experience in times of uncertainty anxiety worry and fear are often heightened these strong emotions are a signal a reminder for you to deepen your connection with yourself you can choose to see these uncertain times as an opportunity to slow down practice inner reflection and look for the positive growth that will come out of the challenges that we are all collectively facing while it feels as though we are each going through this in isolation

you can choose to cultivate more peace and joy I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes if you'd like or simply soften your gaze invite your attention to shift away from the sights smells and sounds around you and begin to bring your focus inward while it may feel like you want to escape reality when things get difficult now is your invitation to make a deeper connection with yourself and with the collective energy of the world become aware of where your body makes contact with the surface below you let this connection ground you feel this as support and allow yourself to be fully supported you are safe you can trust in the universe  use this sensation of where you and your support meet to draw your awareness gradually from your outer experience to your inner world  notice without judgment what your physical sensations are in this moment your body has the amazing ability to cope with challenges and grow stronger from them if you allow and let go of resistance it is okay to befriend the fear that shows up for you fear is not the enemy it is a helpful and necessary emotion when it is channeled correctly meet whatever you're experiencing with love  allow your relaxed awareness now to move to the sensations of your hands notice your hands as they are in this moment what sensations are they are now do you sense tingling or buzzing  are you aware of the temperature of your hands  now make tight fists with both hands clenching and gripping tightly take a deep breath in hold it for a moment and as you exhale as slowly as you can release your hands completely letting go letting go letting go do this again make a tight fist with both hands hold it tight take a deep breath in hold for a moment and again exhale as slowly as you can and release your hands release the gripping letting go throughout your entire body feel how this relaxation moves throughout your entire body as you let go of the gripping in your hands  take a moment to enjoy this ease connect with this relaxed state  while there are many things in life that you don't have control over your breath is one aspect that you can direct a bit to continue relaxing and letting go even deeper invite your exhales to lengthen now if it feels right to you start to count the length of your next inhale and encourage your exhale to be twice as long perhaps you begin with a two count inhale and a four count exhale and as you continue lengthening each exhale and counting your breath you may move to a three and six count follow the lead of your breath breathing in this way for a few more cycles allow your breath to be easy and relaxing continuing to let go of gripping and let go of the need to try too hard  consider the times in life when releasing and letting go gives way to growth trees must let go of leaves in the fall to have the opportunity for new growth in the spring waves in the ocean flow in to the shore and back out again creating a natural ebb and flow [Music] many animals must shed their skin or outer layer in order to grow  as humans we have a period of exhalation to make room for the next inhalation there must be an in period as well as an out period receiving and letting go consider the times when resistance creates more difficulty  for example the spinning wheels of a car in mud the more you try to get out the deeper the wheels dig into the mud  take a moment now to scan through your body can you find any areas where you are holding on breathe into those areas and then let go [Music] perhaps you may be holding on at the area of your stomach can you let go here can you open the flow of energy within you continue to connect with relaxation as deeply as you can practice surrendering practice letting go open to the healing energy within you continue this on your own for the next few moments in silence and I will check back with you soon  when your mind wanders come back to your body come back to your powerful healing energy are you able to relax even more connect even deeper with yourself [Music] listen to your heart surrender to your inner wisdom again become aware of the place where your body meets the support below you sense this connection since the support in times of challenge and uncertainty we can support one another the benefit of your meditation practice and your connection to your inner wisdom will benefit your loved ones neighbors community and the collective energy of the universe we are all in this together and will grow stronger from this time as it draws us closer to one another look through the dark night to see the light trust in the universe  feel the love surrounding you have faith that this will pass take a deep breath in once more and let it out slowly release peace and healing energy out into the world and know that others are doing the same to support you connect with the knowledge that you have the ability and strength to handle whatever comes your way let's take one more deep breath in together and as you let it go slowly open your eyes I am truly grateful and honored to have this opportunity to practice with you may you be well may you be safe and may you live with peace

relax do your best to let go of any expectations of what you think you might sense and simply feel what is there without judgement as you continue to notice the sensations around your head face throat and neck try to connect directly to what you are feeling rather than using your eyes to scan the body the eyes can create tension internally try to sense the feelings from within your body do you feel tingling heat tightness tension or relaxation you might feel a sensation of floating lightness or heaviness you may sense that there is no difference between where you end and where the energy around you begins it is all connected it is all one whatever you're feeling is okay simply observe the sensations as they are and invite in a sense of ease in your body you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part allows it to relax and let go continue moving the scan of your body downward all the way to your feet and stay with the sensations and the relaxation process as you slowly scan your body fully notice any areas that might still be holding on to any lingering tension and ask your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe and supported and knows what to do to relax your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you or needs your immediate attention all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow yourself to relax experience and embrace the feelings of unconditional love for yourself being fully present to this moment to your physical body to the sounds around you and the surface below you set the intention for peace and relaxation for your physical body for you mentally and spiritually your mind may naturally drift off into thoughts and that is okay you do not need to completely shut off your mind and empty it of all thoughts when you do recognize that your mind is drifting acknowledge your thoughts without following those thoughts into a drawn-out story you can choose to visualize the thoughts drifting off into the distance like a cloud floating by and then come back to your breath to ground you and bring you into the present moment once more the breath is your place to be fully present the breath gives you the opportunity to pause if your attention shifts to focus on a sensation or emotion allow it to move away from your breath for a moment to notice what's coming up in your physical body again without judgment and without getting caught up in thinking stories intend to allow the sensations or emotions as they are if your attention begins to drift simply come back to your breath as your anchor to ground you in this present moment and now begin to bring your awareness back to this present moment back to the surface below you and when you are ready take a deep breath and then sigh it out breathe out any remaining stress frustration tension and distraction from within you don't be afraid to make a sound take another deep breath and allow your exhale to flow out of you cleansing and healing your body and mind like a warm wave of energy do this again and notice how you become increasingly more relaxed yet energized and focused at the same time feel yourself becoming present anchored and grounded in the simple practice of breathing deeply and when you are ready open your eyes knowing you are calm and focused to go on with your day
0 now I invite you to find comfort  choose a position either seated or lying down with your spine straight begin by closing your eyes to heighten your awareness of this present moment through the senses other than sight  explore and connect with the space around you using your senses  allow yourself to settle in to this space noticing how you relate to the room around you  notice the air in the room since the temperature of the air as it gently contacts your skin does the air around you feel humid or dry is there a distinct smell in the room and now listen for any sounds within this room  perhaps you hear the word of a fan or air conditioning unit  sounds are vibrations and can sometimes be felt within your body look inward and feel the sounds and growing your field of consciousness now to look for any distant sounds you may be able to hear without straining listen to the sound that is the farthest that you can hear  letting your awareness shift inward to your body now  and how it interacts with your surroundings  notice the feel of the fabric of your clothes on your body  since the constant pull of gravity anchoring you into the surface beneath you now allow your relaxed awareness to rest on your breath without manipulation without judgment be the observer of your natural automatic breath be here now as an observer and witness as your body is being breathed there is no right or wrong no good or bad you are exactly where you need to be this body  this moment this breath nothing has ever happened in the past and nothing will ever happen in the future life always takes place in this present moment our lives are a series of present moment experiences what is there for you in the experience of this moment lean into this moment say yes to this moment with your breath allow it to be the perfect moment that it is  slowly allow your breath to deepen inviting your spine to lengthen as you inhale without effort or force guide your breath to be deep in both location and volume  listen to the sound your inhale makes  inhale with an intention an intention to fully accept this moment as it arrives when we want the moment to be different than it is we create an internal conflict a fight with reality when we accept the moment for what it is we can add peace and ease to our moments knowing wholeheartedly they are as they should be  we are on our journey always at the right place always at the right time  now let your breath soften to a natural rhythm continuing to inhale with this intention of presence and as you exhale allow yourself to let go let go of areas of tension in your body perhaps around your eyes and jaw  softening your neck and shoulders let go of negativity from the past let go of the worry of what's to come to be here in this present moment give yourself permission to let go of the to-do lists the shoulds and the students allow yourself to rest your awareness on the right now this inhale this exhale  this gift of breath you have right now for the next few moments of silence I invite you to continue to practice being with your breath as the observer  watch the path of each inhale and exhale listen and feel your breath fully as it shows up for you right now  observe yourself experiencing this present moment  allow your breath to slowly deepen again invite your awareness back to the surface noticing the sounds in the room again perhaps since any difference of how you feel now from when you began this meditation and when you are ready makes some very small movements with your body maybe rubbing your thumb and finger together or perhaps wiggling your toes and begin to let a little light into your eyes and now take one more deep breath opening your eyes and smiling in gratitude for taking this time for yourself thank you for practicing with me today
0 first let me offer my sincere congratulations to you for taking this important first step in your meditation practice the fact that you are hearing this recording means you have decided to make time for yourself to turn the lens of your vision inward when we are more often looking outward frequently not knowing the right way to meditate or the possibility of not doing it perfectly may be discouraging when beginning a practice in reality meditation is not a destination it is a journey it is not about the outcome it is about the process about the curiosity you bring to what is there for you right now there is no wrong way to do it this is why we refer to it as a meditation practice not a meditation perfect for today's practice we will follow three stages and if you decide to continue to practice on your own you can follow these stages or come back to this recording as a guide as frequently as you like you can follow these three stages for five minutes or an hour or any time you decide simply show up with a positive and open mind and now let's begin I invite you to find a posture that allows you to be alert and awake yet still unrelaxed perhaps close your eyes or soften your gaze on a fixed point and let the background blur [Music] without expectations of what you think you will find observe your breath in its natural state without changing or judging the first stage of today's meditation is to focus on one thing and that will be your breath [Music] the next stage is to focus on nothing in particular with the intention to go back to the first stage of focus if you find your mind wandering and the third stage is to let go into blissful peace and simply be these stages do not need to be linear and you can move from one to the other and back again sometimes practicing will be comfortable and come easily and other times it may be difficult and uncomfortable emotions can arise your meditation practice parallels life in this way the practice is about the journey not the destination begin to notice any sensations you experience on each inhale [Music] maybe you feel the air passed through your nostrils can you sense the path your breath travels once inside your body [Music] [Music] what subtle changes do you experience with each breath in notice your chest and back rise and expand with each inhale do you feel invigorated with each inhale and now what do you notice about your natural exhale do you sense a softening as your breath is expelled what does your breath sound like perhaps you feel that the air is slightly warmer with your exhale than it is on your inhale notice your chest and back sink and soften with each exhale notice your own natural pattern as it comes and goes do you feel a subtle relaxation as you exhale each time [Music] and now for the next few breaths since the natural pause between each part of your breath there is a moment after you inhale and before you begin your next exhale where you can bring your attention to rest [Music] continuing to focus on your breath a little longer begin to create an equal part breath starting to count the length of your inhale and match the length with your exhale you may find that as you practice this equal part breath the lengths and depth of your breath extends whatever you notice is okay perhaps explore what it would be like to start your inhale from low in your belly then fill up your ribs and chest then all the way up to your throat and then exhale fully for the same length as your inhale practice this equal count breath for several more cycles until your focus naturally releases the counting to focus on nothing in particular then you will practice being in quiet stillness if your mind wanders off into thought or story or you notice a noise or distraction simply bring your attention back to your counting and the equal part breath until you are ready once more to focus on nothing specific and let go into bliss enjoy this practice for a few moments longer and I will bring your attention back when it's time this is a practice it is natural to lose focus so be kind to yourself and keep coming back continue to start over when you need without judging it is time now to begin the journey to looking outward once more take your time deepen your breath again bring some gentle movements to your fingers and toes and welcome in refreshing energy throughout your body as your field of consciousness grows out from your Center bring some light and color into your eyes from your surroundings at first notice this space where part of you is still looking inward as another part of you is beginning to look outward again how long can this experience last throughout your day are you able to metaphorically continue to have one eye looking inward as the other is looking outward thank you for practicing with me today remember meditation like learning any other skill takes practice perseverance and patience keep showing up keep practicing

down with your back straight allow your eyes to close gently and begin to notice your breath you have chosen to take this time to honor yourself in a positive way you are bringing mindfulness to the way that you live you are strengthening the connection between your body and your mind today you will build the skill of mindfulness and living in the present moment [Music] now without making any changes to your breath simply notice how it flows in through your nose and fills up your body with life [Music] follow the flow of the air as it goes into your body through your nostrils [Music] and notice how your chest and abdomen rise and fall naturally as the breath comes in and goes out [Music] this breath will be your anchor and keep you rooted in the present moment during this practice and beyond [Music] when you focus on your breath you are always focused in the present moment you cannot get back a past breath and you cannot breathe in a future breath before the present moment [Music] as you continue to stay with your breath as an anchor to the present moment allow it to flow naturally [Music] releasing any physical and emotional tension with each exhale [Music] and now begin to deepen each breath in and out [Music] as your breath fills you up more fully [Music] invite your attention to rest on the space that comes between the inhale and the exhale [Music] and as you focus your attention on this stillness allow it to last a little longer pausing holding the breath momentarily between the inhale and the exhale [Music] breathe in this way for three more cycles of breath attending to the stillness the pause [Music] and feel as the tension melts away from your body [Music] give yourself permission to be fully supported by your surroundings and be open to the possibilities of what comes with this state of comfort [Music] allow your mind to quiet [Music] and the noises and the responsibilities of the world around you to turn off [Music] as you still may have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer [Music] and by the space between your thoughts to extend [Music] just as you did with the space between your breaths [Music] in just a moment you are going to continue this practice of awareness as you bring your attention to your physical body in order to relax each part of your body beginning at the top of your head moving all the way down to the bottom of your feet I will guide you through this process and as you hear each part of your body being spoken you will first bring your awareness to that area simply noticing how it feels without judgement [Music] and then you will relax that part deeply [Music] and now turn your attention to the top of your head first visualize and feel your scalp and head [Music] and then welcome in relaxation [Music] as you begin to progressively release each muscle notice how powerful your awareness is [Music] and how just a thought in your mind can have the ability to relax your entire body so deeply [Music] continuing the scan of your body feel your forehead soften and smooth since your eyebrows and your eyes [Music] as they began to melt noticing the tiny muscles around your eyes release perhaps you can feel that your eyelids are becoming very heavy notice your cheeks soften  allow your teeth to part  unclench your jaw and relax your tongue feel your throat softening  and notice as your neck let's go of any held tension invite this relaxation to move into your shoulders feel the warm comfort moving downward as the tension melts out of your shoulders moving down your arms and flowing out of your body through your fingertips with each breath notice the contraction and expansion of your abdomen and chest as the sensation of heaviness washes over you now allow your chest to relax completely perhaps you notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax even more  what other sensations do you notice in this moment  the simple process of noticing your breath noticing your physical body and your surroundings [Music] is such a powerful tool for relaxation and stress relief bringing you into the present  notice as this comfort begins to move down your body now releasing the tension from your lower back and your hips your thighs feel heavy and sink into the surface below you your knees soften  and you allow your calves to melt  and as your body continues to rest your ankles and feet let go of any remaining tension your body feels to be completely relaxed to be safe and supported you now allow yourself to drift even further into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go completely  as you continue to be aware of your breath and your physical body in this moment follow the sound of my voice on this journey of relaxation  take notice of any thoughts or distractions that may come into your mind simply acknowledge the thought and allow your breath to carry it away now as you continue to relax begin to use your imagination and see yourself on a soft fluffy white cloud  this cloud is special and it is just for you when you lay down on this cloud it fits you perfectly it supports you entirely so you can let go of any need for holding on  as you rest on this cloud you will safely take a journey as it drips you off to your favorite place this is a peaceful place with your imagination see this beautiful place in vivid detail this place may be a place that you have been to before or one that exists only in your imagination here you are happy calm and at peace see yourself here take in all of your surroundings use all of your senses listen to the sounds  smell the smells feel that the temperature around you is the perfect temperature for you [Music] and know that when you are in this perfect peaceful place nothing bad can happen you are safe you are supported you are completely in control I am simply your guide here in this deeply tranquil state

you continue to relax and simply be  you will hear me speak statements or ideas to contemplate [Music] that will support you on your journey to personal truth with these positive statements settling into the deepest part of your subconscious you will be wonderfully surprised at your increasing self-confidence this is because you are connected to yourself [Music] and you are choosing to live

0 thank you for joining me for this guided meditation to help you relax into the resistance the saying goes what you resist persists if you stop and think about how this applies to your life you may find that this is true for both your physical experience as well as your emotional state the lesson is to trust the experience accept what is with respect of the journey and simply allow letting go of worry expectations and the need to be in complete control at all times is the way past resistance being mindful is the practice of noticing and allowing the experience without judgment as we begin to settle into our meditation practice they invite you to make yourself comfortable sit or lie down in a way that allows you to find ease in a position where you feel safe to be supported by the surface below you so you can completely let go of the need to hold yourself up or to control your posture this intentional choice is sending your brain a message that you are ready to relax into the flow of this practice and the flow of the energy of life begin to make any small subtle adjustments to your body to welcome the relaxed peaceful state to wash over your entire physical body and your consciousness as you are beginning to surrender into the calm bring your attention to the natural rhythm of your breath your body and your brain are always working together to breathe so you don't have to constantly be thinking about it however the simple act of mindfully attending to your breath deepening your breath and being intentional about it sends a message that it is okay to relax now is the time for inviting ease into your body take an intentionally slow and deep breath and take another one take your time filling up as much as you can and slow down your exhale as well be patient with your breath feel as your next breath happens to you easily and effortlessly perhaps deepening and slowing down your natural rhythm and now simply allow your breath to continue on its own relax into your breath let it be as your breath finds an easy natural flow move your attention to your physical body the intention as you scan your body is loving compassionate allowing of what is it is all part of who you are send an invitation to release what does not serve you slowly bring your awareness to your toes since this area without judgments or expectations what do you notice [Music] what would it be like to relax this area your intention to bring your awareness to a specific part of your body gives it permission to relax by simply noticing you can find ease moving your attention slowly up your body as you sense the soles of your feet you are ankles your calves and your knees if there is any area of your body that is speaking to you keep your attention there a little longer breathe into that area invite a release allow whatever you're feeling to be what it is and to pass through you rather than pushing it down no need to label what you are sensing simply experience it and allow it to release and relax take as long as you need attending to each part of your body perhaps you are ready to move your attention up to your thighs your hips your abdomen and low back our physical body holds on to emotions and can be resistant to letting go by attending to the sensations as they arise breathing into what you experience and patiently allowing they will pass through you then you will bring ease and comfort into your body what would it feel like to release the pain and discomfort from your body relax into the resistance now move your attention to your ribs your chest and your heart open your heart open the energy of your heart with loving-kindness and compassion for yourself and others this is a safe place to let down the protective wall that has perhaps been surrounding your heart what would it be like to open your heart to give your love and energy freely and to be open to receive it back if this brings up sensations or a shift in emotions come back to the intention of loving compassionate allowing of what is let it be  release what does not serve you moving your attention to your shoulders your arms your hands  and fingers continue to relax each body part as your attention washes over it  since now the area of your neck and throat can you let go of any tightness holding or guarding can you find more space for the energy to flow freely here what would it be like for this area to be open giving and receiving of energy like the area of your heart sensing the release of your jaw cheeks eyes forehead and scalp  take one more patient scan of your body to welcome a little more love compassion and relaxation to any areas that may still need it it is all part of what makes you unique let it be allow it now that your body is relaxed and you have let go of any tightness or tension in your physical body I will guide you to explore your emotions mindfully know that you are in a safe space and you can open your eyes and stop at any time if you feel the need to do so consider something in your life where you may be experiencing resistance simply recognize the emotions arising that surround this experience whatever you're feeling is okay it is safe to be vulnerable right now during your practice during meditation there is no guilt or judgments there is no right or wrong perhaps there is something you have been denying for some time know that whatever it is that you are resisting is simply an obstacle on your path it is part of your journey these moments are opportunities for learning and growth because this may be a negative or challenging emotion do your best to let down your guard let down your armor to what you are feeling as it is make space for awareness and acceptance without judgment this experience these emotions are part of you and they are okay simply allow know that Worry has not solved any problems or prevented any disasters worried brings unnecessary suffering and takes away from experiencing the present moment to the fullest resistance brings your energy to what you do not want rather than what you do want what would it be like to trust the situation and allow as you continue to explore see deeply into the situation are there any recurring thoughts images beliefs or stories associated with this resistance know that you are enough trust and allow the experience with love and compassion for yourself and others for the next few moments continue relaxing into the resistance with patience breathe into it  let it be slowly bring your attention back to your physical body back to the surface below you bring some gentle movements to your body to re-energize you as you are slowly coming out of the state of relaxation know that you can patiently continue to relax into the resistance whether physical or emotional come back to this meditation practice as often as you need trust you are enough allow mindfully and know that the experience itself is not you let go and rest in awareness itself things are just as they are when you are ready open your eyes with love and compassion for yourself 
0 when you resist or resent difficult emotions you add unnecessary suffering to your experience [Music] if you are able to recognize these difficult emotions with love and compassion you allow them to move through you and can reduce the added suffering you can use this powerful practice of being present and nurturing these difficult emotions with love and compassion today you can use my guidance to start and then use this practice on your own anytime you need it as we begin i invite you to make yourself comfortable as you settle into comfort begin to notice your breath as a way to come into your present moment experience allow your breath to be just as it is and as you come into presence welcome a softening a letting go of any hell tension as your attention to your breath allows you to relax just a little bit further [Music] become aware of your physical sensations notice if there are any difficult emotions arising that are making it more difficult to be [Music] present you might notice where in your body you are feeling this difficult emotion [Music] and if it feels right to you you can place your hand on that area [Music] this gesture is showing you that you cherish yourself do your best to let go of the story around your emotions [Music] let go of any expectations you might have and simply feel the sensations within your body [Music] this practice is not about what you are experiencing it is more about how you are responding to those sensations [Music] when you allow yourself to feel these sensations you have the choice to respond to them [Music] in a positive way so that you don't allow these emotions to control you [Music] right now as you're sitting in your present moment experience you are choosing to respond to your emotions with compassion and loving kindness [Music] staying in the present moment continuing to notice and accept your emotions and your physical experience [Music] begin to inquire within and ask yourself what is it that would help me in this time what would best serve my experience right now you have the opportunity to let go of the story to feel your emotions [Music] and to meet these feelings with kindness [Music] you might offer yourself the phrase i am here for you or i love and care for you just like a friend or a loved one might offer support to you [Music] by showing yourself this love and support you can create a safe space for your emotions to come forward [Music] and take the next few moments of silence to offer yourself love and nurturing to this area where you are sensing strong emotions if that feels difficult you might imagine this loving nurturing experience coming from a loved one [Music] or this nurturing might come from some other form of energy [Music] so [Music] begin to deepen your breath let the inflow of air bring more love more nurturing to anywhere in your body that might still need it [Music] know that with each breath in you have an opportunity to pause be with your emotions and meet those emotions with love and compassion and now begin to become aware of your surroundings notice any sounds around you [Music] perhaps you begin to notice your fingers and toes once more and when you feel ready take another deep breath in and as you let it out allow your eyes to softly blink open [Music] and know that you can take this pause recognize your strong emotions and meet them with love and compassion at any time you need come back to this practice as often as you need and i thank you for practicing with me today i hope you have a peaceful day
0 I am grateful you have chosen me to be your guide today please subscribe to this channel for more guided meditations each week and consider sharing with anyone you think can find value from these videos and now I invite you to make yourself comfortable make any large shifts in your position to find a resting place of ease take your time make any small and subtle adjustments to your body to fully relax perhaps releasing your facial expressions from around your eyes and your mouth allow all the tiny muscles in your face and jaw to soften and let go settle into ease allow the settling to flow into your mind as well you it takes time and patience to quiet the busy mind just like stretching a muscle requires relaxation to let the muscle lengthen the mind requires relaxation to slow down to make space you today we will intentionally attend to our breath to bring about the relaxation response to help let go of stress to let go of any negativity that you may be holding on to to let go of the need for perfection and control and to let go of anything else that may be limiting you now I invite you to breathe in deeply through your nose and breathe out through your mouth with a relaxed jaw making a sigh noise continue breathing deeply for a few cycles while observing your breath as soon as all of your air is released allow your next breath in begin to notice the moment when your exhale flows right into your inhale and then when your inhale becomes your next exhale and on and on the flow goes like an ocean wave coming into Shore and rolling back out again you may notice that your breath has returned to its natural rhythm we're not controlled the breath has an automated tempo and depth feel the sensation of being breathed receiving the breath into your body there is a force greater than us working to send breath into our bodies and it is our job to allow it to invite in the breath we can only control our breath for so long before it returns to automation the same is true in life you now moving your attention to each exhale to breathe out is to let go of air to let go of energy to surrender to the natural rhythm of breath for the next few breaths focus on each exhale has a time to let go perhaps on your next breath in make fists with your hands and squeeze them tightly and as you exhale literally let go of the tension release your grip let go of anything you're holding on to as you breathe out and feel the sensation ripple through the rest of your body and with each subsequent exhale let go of what you no longer need it may be pain it may be anger it may be heartbreak or it maybe control whatever it is for you simply let it go let go of tension let go of any heaviness weighing on you [Music] [Music] continue to attend to your natural breath rhythm mindfully [Music] observing all you can about your breath our breath is always with us and by using it as a focal point we become present we cannot get back to a past breath and we cannot breathe a future breath the only breath we have is this one in the present moment by using breath as a focal point as part of our meditation practice we develop the conditioning to know that at anytime we need we can simply shift our focus to our breath perhaps during a stressful interaction with a loved one while stuck in traffic or as anxiety builds there is no need to bring out the meditation cushion in order to practice being mindful we can simply and mindfully breathe and as we have practiced today our breath has the ability to bring about the familiar state of relaxation and calm [Music] you [Music] with practice you will find that perhaps this conditioned relaxation becomes your reflexive response showing up naturally and quickly [Music] breathing naturally brings oxygen to your blood into your brain to bring about the feeling of safety and with this feeling of safety comes the relaxation response just like an intentional smile bring the sensations of happiness mindful breathing bring the sensations of calm to the mind and body stress and relaxation cannot exist together much like the way light cancels out darkness inviting relaxation into the body can cancel out any remaining stress or tension your breath will bring a sensation of release to each part of your body and now imagine breathing into your shoulders and neck since the natural movement in this area that is connected to your breath rhythm like an ocean wave can invite the sensation to move down from your shoulders through your arms and hands visualize the movement of your breath pulsing through each arm and hand to relax fully and by your breath to fill your chest ribs and abdomen making space for energy to flow freely open your heart with a sense of lightning and then soften your belly peel from the inside the flowing quality of your breath as it travels the length of your body see the breath now moving down into your hips and legs relax your ankles and feet with each wave of breath and since the breath now in the soles of the feet sense the breath going to every cell in your body healing with life's energy stay with your breath and the sensations that come along with it for the next few moments of silence begin now to activate the muscles in your face and around your eyes with an intentional joyful smile feel the smile wash over your face and notice what a simple smile can do for how you are feeling continue to smile for a few more moments feeling the sense of joy building inside you and when you are ready begin to bring some gentle movements to your fingers and your toes moving the energy through your limbs and when you are ready open your eyes knowing that you can always come back to your breath mindfully thank you so much for listening I hope you have a beautiful day

is your experience it is okay do your best to be with everything you sense this too is part of you pain is part of you a part of you in need of nourishment the most continue sending positive healing energy to those parts stay with the sensations a short while longer and reflect on the amazing ability and automatic functions of your body send gratitude and vitality to each and every part of your body your heart and your soul invite your attention to rest on your breath as it flows in its natural rhythm now notice its path its tempo and its fullness perhaps your breath is beginning to slow down and deepen as you relax or maybe you feel your breath has become shallow or even pauses momentarily whatever you're experiencing is perfect simply be with the sensations as they arise feel the sensations of being breathed receiving the breath into your body filling you up restoring your energetic balance and sense of calm to breathe in is to fill up with air to fill up with healing life-giving energy focus on your inhale for the next few breaths like a pitcher being filled up with water from the bottom to the top this is our ability to nourish and heal ourselves there is a force greater than us working to send breath into our bodies and it is our job to allow it to invite in the breath we need to both breathe in to fill up as well as to breathe out to let go in order to be balanced to breathe out is to let go of air to let go of energy to surrender to the natural rhythm of breath you can let go to make room for nourishing energy to fill you up consider each breath out as a time for releasing any unwanted energies and developing the energy you do desire this is your time to heal and let go life nature and every energetic being experiences a natural ebb and flow an inhalation period as well as an exhalation period and life is the balance of expending energy and restoring energy a balance of growth and rest for the next few breaths focus on each exhale as a time

0 lao-tzu once said nature does not hurry yet everything is accomplished just as the way water patiently erodes the surface of Iraq we too can soften over time when we follow the path of least resistance and let go of our struggles we add unnecessary suffering to our experience when we want our reality to be something other than what it really is with patience for the process we can release our resistance accept what is and we can experience peace letting go of resistance and experiencing acceptance is an ongoing practice it is one that can be especially difficult yet extremely useful during challenging and uncertain times slowing down and discovering patience during meditation is like training for our day-to-day life experiences enjoy the process be patient allow yourself to learn and grow and trust the journey hello and welcome I'm Sarah Raymond thank you for joining me today let's begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes gently and take a patient deep breath in and as you breathe out allow your body to soften in a moment I will guide you in a four seven eight breath pattern then you can continue the same pattern on your own you will breathe in through your nose for the count of four then hold for a count of seven if you can or shorter if you need then breathe out through your mouth for the count of eight and now to begin breathe out completely now breathe in two three four hold two three four five six seven breathe out two three four five six seven eight and one more cycle together breathe in two three four hold two three four five six seven breathe out two three four five six seven eight and now continue this pattern on your own for a few more cycles [Music] [Music] allow your breath to return to its natural pattern and let go of the Counting [Music] take a moment to simply notice how you are feeling after practicing a few deliberate relaxing breaths [Music] invite your attention to effortlessly drift around your physical sensations to notice your current state observe the quality of the state you're in without making any changes or judging where you are simply check-in are you calm what is your heart rate like at this moment what are the sensations you are experiencing in your body are you warm or cool what else is your attention drawn to as the observer of your natural state [Music] what can you patiently discover about yourself as you look inward on your experience [Music] [Music] now that you have observed your unchanged experience scan through your body once more look for anywhere you can let go the tendency to hold on is there anywhere in your physical body that you can let go let go of tension let go of tightness or pain there may be areas that are holding on that you weren't even aware of until you patiently looked inward today right now I invite you to welcome more ease into your body [Music] what would it feel like in your body to slow down and discover peace [Music] [Music] what would it feel like to experience calm to be still [Music] breathe this in experience this right now this stillness this calm state is a time to go within [Music] life nature and every person experiences a natural ebb and flow of energy an inhalation period as well as an exhalation period [Music] life is the balance of giving and receiving of expending energy and conserving energy it is up to you to discover patience and Trust this journey [Music] as humans energetically we can learn from the rhythms of nature each of the seasons has its own energy and symbolism that indicates where nature is in its yearly cycle you can learn from the seasons and their energetic changes to help you move through your own seasonal cycle and energetic shift each season has meaning and can invite contemplation of the connections of nature to your own experiences fall is a time of letting go of what no longer serves you letting go so you can welcome in change and new beginnings winter can be a time of stillness to go within perhaps planning for the future and nurturing what is important to you and after the cold dark time of winter spring brings a sense that your soul is rested and at the same time spring carries the promise of renewal like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon [Music] summer is bursting with light and growth and freedom [Music] these symbols of nature's seasons may relate to different seasons of your life the reminder is that everything changes and goes through stages no matter the season that you are experiencing now consider the energy of the seasons as you contemplate this cycle in nature as well as your own life what is your experience can you discover the patience of nature and use it to cultivate the same patience within yourself what would it be like to allow yourself to slow down let go of resistance and Trust the journey [Music] [Music] fall can be a reminder for you to acknowledge and accept the impermanence and brief nature of things winter encourages you to go within and conserve your energy while spring and summer offer the beauty of new growth the warmer months are a reminder to appreciate all of the beauty that surrounds us in this world tomorrow is not guaranteed and we have the opportunity to enjoy this moment and live every day to the fullest [Music] the lessons and energy from each season can change your mood it can change your perspectives and therefore your choices nature is a reminder to recognize that all things change all things are beautiful and perfect in their own unique way at just the right time nature doesn't rush its process all changes happen seasons change and everything gets accomplished without worry [Music] bring your awareness to the sensations and energy of your body once more take a patient deep breath in and let it out as slowly as you can since a building of energy within you know that like nature the Sun shines the light on what we may not have seen before you have taken the time to go inward to slow down and discover the beauty of patience to recognize that you can trust the journey you can welcome the changes and stages of your life just like nature breathe that in feel the patients within you when you are ready open your eyes let the light in trust the journey remember to slow down listen observe and be patient look for the seasons to change the energy to change and

taken five deep intentional and relaxing breaths invite in a sense of comfort and relaxation with each breath in breathe into the heart and expand the capacity of this space with each breath out let go of tension let go of distractions let go of the need to control your thoughts [Music] allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and flow and as you continue to relax I will guide you on a journey this journey will take you on a path to release any negative beliefs or ideas that could be holding you back from the abundance you desire then you will bring in the energy of abundance into the space you create for it when you let go of fears I invite you now to open your imagination and step into a field of beautiful wildflowers look around you as you stand on a path that leads you right down the center of the field here you are surrounded on both sides by flowers and the most vivid colors use your senses to take in this beautiful and peaceful environment around you see the clear bright sky above you feel that the temperature of the air is perfect for you and the Sun shines on you gently warming your skin the faint smell of the flowers is just right for your liking perhaps you hear birds chirping in a distance or see butterflies flitting around as you look around you can see many beautiful colors in all directions around you you sense that you are safe and peaceful in this place in your imagination you begin to walk along this path down the center of the field moving towards some rolling hills of even more wildflowers [Music] as you walk you have a feeling that you are carrying around something extra something weighing you down making you feel heavy and tired you reach into your pockets and feel that surprisingly there are some smooth stones these stones that you are carrying around weighing you down represent your fears and your feelings of not enough they represent anything known or unknown to you that is holding you back each stone is something that is blocking the flow of abundance to you slowly take one stone out of your pocket and leave it on the path behind you as you continue walking slowly feel a space open up inside of you as you let go of something negative in your life there's no need to label what you're letting go of simply let go knowing it is something that is no longer supporting your goals and desires for abundance continue to do the same with each of the remaining stones in your pocket one at a time take your time and feel the energetic shift feel the space you have opened up for flow [Music] now that you have let go of that which no longer serves you and you have made room for the flow of abundance invite it in letting go of resistance gives way to an attitude of allowing allow in positive energy thoughts and beliefs allow ingratitude love and abundance feel this flow of positive energy within you and it is magnetically attracted back to you take a moment and sense this energy and positive feeling as you look around at the field of flowers now you can see possibilities and abundance everywhere you look each of the flowers around you grew from a seed each seed had everything it needed within to become the flower that it is and each flower has the seeds to become many more flowers and on and on the cycle goes much like these flowers have grown from seeds you to have everything you need within you to have the life of your dreams and to attract the abundance in your life that you desire the abundance of flowers around you represent abundance in your life [Music] now call to mind what part of your life you would like to see a flow of abundance visualize this component of your life exactly as you want it to be and feel how it would feel as if this is already true soak in the feelings in this present moment [Music] [Music] the things you think about at the beginning of your day color your thoughts for the day ahead in a moment I will guide you with some positive affirmation statements inviting the flow of abundance into your life you can simply listen and feel the statements or you can repeat them if you choose I acknowledge the positive things in my life I express the feeling of gratitude often for the blessings in my life I love myself and believe I am worthy of abundance to flow to me I allow the flow of abundance in all aspects of my life I attract success and abundance I radiate positive loving energy and that is what comes back to me I take action towards my goals of abundance every day I let go of negative influences and energy that do not serve me I know that abundance is unlimited and that my abundance will benefit others I am generous and give my unique gifts to the world and now you have prepared your mind for the day ahead to see the world with gratitude and to allow the flow of abundance to you [Music] as you go about your day you will continue to radiate out love and positive energy as you attract it back to you now begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment back to the surface below you deepen your breath again and invite in a building sense of energy to start your day and when you're ready open your eyes and start your day attracting success and abundance thank you for listening
0 I have a guided meditation to help you relax this practice is great for putting a pause on a stressful experience or negative emotions and simply connecting inward and now let's begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable choosing any position that allows you to feel fully supported where you can relax and let go [Music] choose a position that you know you are safe and gives you the opportunity to [Music] focus inward [Music] perhaps close your eyes if you like [Music] and begin to settle in [Music] make any small subtle adjustments to your posture patiently think deeper into comfort take your time there's no rush here you set aside this time where no one needs anything from you or no responsibilities for the next little while [Music] let this be a pleasure for you to enjoy [Music] and as you settle into comfort allow your attention to rest at the sensations of your hands [Music] notice the palms of your hands [Music] and since the tops of your hands [Music] and notice all the way to the very tips of your fingers [Music] and since both hands as a whole [Music] notice if there's a temperature around the area of your hands do you sense energy perhaps buzzing or a vibration or tingling [Music] whatever you are feeling it's just right [Music] this practice is simply about looking for what's there recognizing your true experience in this present moment [Music] can you sense a feeling of weight at the area of your hands maybe your hands feel very heavy and solid into the surface below you or perhaps I feel light as if they could float off the surface below you and drift into the air [Music] notice if there's a color around the area of your hands that can be sensed [Music] and now with a relaxed awareness welcome your attention to rest on your feet notice the tops of your feet and ankles [Music] notice your toes [Music] and the soles of your feet [Music] is there a temperature you are aware of at the area of your feet [Music] is it warm or cool [Music] or simply neutral are you able to sense heavy or light at the area of your feet [Music] perhaps you notice a color when your attention rests at the area of your feet [Music] is there an energetic quality at the area of your feet [Music] allowing your attention to continue to stay here at the area of your feet [Music] imagine bringing in energy from the earth from all around you [Music] imagine bringing in this energy from the soles of your feet as if they were permeable [Music] the energy moves in from the soles of your feet and it intuitively moves to wherever your body needs it [Music] your body and this energy coming in from the outside flow as if dancing together [Music] creating a beautiful flow of energy filling you up [Music] where you maybe depleted [Music] moving excess energy where there may be a buildup since this energy swirling around you flowing throughout your entire body [Music] letting go of excess energy through the crown of your head and drawing in energy to refill you from the soles of your feet [Music] perhaps you can sense this energy [Music] like a warm embrace from a loved one or perhaps it feels like the weight of a heavy warm blanket [Music] stay with this flow of energy [Music] for just a little longer allowing your body to connect with the energy [Music] so that the energy knows where to go [Music] now sensing the areas of your hands and your feet once more bringing some gentle movements to those areas feeling the energy building up at your hands and your feet once more and take a moment as we close the practice to connect with that perfect level of energy feel it in your body like muscle memory know that you have the ability to come back to this moment this sensation any time you need it is already within you your body knows how to find balance it may just need a little loving attention and encouragement when it feels right to you open your eyes I hope you have a wonderful day thank you so much for practicing with me I'd love to hear how your practice went share in the comments below and I look forward to practicing with you again

0 welcome and thank you for listening to this guided meditation to practice using a positive internal dialogue as you go through your day there is a continuous dialogue that occurs inside your head often planning for the future or remembering events of the past frequently this includes expectations all of the shoulds and the judgments we have of ourselves that may come from others or from internally sometimes we may knowingly or unknowingly repeat negative statements in our head have negative beliefs or engage in negative self-talk our subconscious mind listens to all of the internal dialogue that goes on whether positive or negative these thoughts act as affirmations and the more we listen to them the more we believe them the chatter in our minds that goes on each and every day is energy and has the potential to play a strong role in our beliefs as well as the energy we send out into this world each time we say these negative things or they are told to us we begin to believe them we send out negative energy and that negative energy comes back to us and these negative thoughts take root in our subconscious they can affect what happens in our lives the choices we make and the way we interact with others each thought has a ripple effect outward on our life much like a stone thrown into a lake making small waves outward knowing this gives us the ability to choose instead to effect ourselves in a positive way we can retrain our minds by using positive thoughts and sending out positive energy by repeating positive affirmations in our mind and out loud these two will become beliefs today we will first begin to relax our body in our mind with attention to our breath and a connection to our senses I invite you to make yourself comfortable you take a moment to settle in you have chosen to take this time to honor yourself in a positive way by bringing mindfulness to the way you live you are strengthening the connection between your body and your mind if you like allow your eyes to close gently down and take a moment to bring your awareness to your breath without changing or forcing your breath notice its natural pace its natural depth and the path it takes inside of your body listen to the sound your breath makes on the inside hear the sound building as you inhale and softening as you let it go hear the rhythm of your breath as it relates to your heartbeat are they aligned whatever you hear is as it should be simply listen and now attend to your sense of smell as you breathe smell the air as it comes into your nostrils what do you sense without attaching a label to the sense simply experience what is around you feel your breath now feel the movement of your breath feel the expansion in your lungs feel the rise and fall of your body perhaps since the way your clothes contact your skin or how the surface below you feels as it connects with your body since the change as your ribs expand and since the pressure building and releasing between the front and back of your body maybe you can see your breath from within visualize its path notice where each breath travels within are there any areas your breath avoids or spends extra time in and since the relaxation and cleansing effect your breath has on your body and mind your breath has the power to bring you into peace begin now to feel the temperature of your breath as it flows into your body is it warm is it cool does it have the same temperature on the out-breath this awareness practice is about bringing focus to your senses there is no right or wrong way to do it no correct answers there is simply awareness and curiosity and what arises for you spend the next few moments being mindful of your senses and your breath as you continue to attend to your breath and your senses begin to explore your emotions as they arise with a curious and kind approach today I invite you to explore your habitual negative self-talk or beliefs without judgment perhaps consider how these things that you may say to yourself or believe about yourself might be limiting you from reaching your full potential and fulfilling your passions know that we are all human and we are perfectly imperfect without mistakes or failures or imperfections we would not grow we would not improve we would not learn new ways of doing things without darkness we would not know the beauty of light without sadness we would not know joy without pain we would not know pleasure know that these feelings coming up are simply energy moving through your body and out into the world and while you cannot stop these emotions you can stop them from taking over and dictating how you respond to your life's events you have the ability to respond in a positive and loving way the positive and loving energy you have in you when you interact with others can affect each event in life place your hand on your heart if you like and tell yourself that you love yourself sit with this feeling without judgment or expectations give love to yourself as you do for others know that you can pause for a moment out of your busy day at any time to say these words and reconnect to your heart practice repeating the following loving phrases in your mind or use your own positive phrases if you choose believe in these phrases in this present moment feel the truth of these statements in your body in your heart and in your mind I am enough I love you I am listening to what you need I am lovable just the way I am I am free beautiful and wise I am perfectly imperfect sit with these positive statements for a few more moments of silence and feel the love building inside of you and now welcome a deep breath into your body know that you can come back to your mindful attention often throughout your daily life you can meet your feelings where they are with kindness and compassion and you can continue to practice building a positive internal dialogue now bring your awareness back to your physical body to the sensations inside you in this present moment continue to invite in a building sense of love an honoring of your beautiful heart take in one more deep breath sending it into the area of your heart to make space for unconditional love and when you already open your eyes thank you so much for listening today
0 our current culture is fast-paced and frequently very demanding not allowing for very much downtime to recover it's not surprising that many of us have experienced stress overwhelm and anxiety at some point in our lives these feelings are often caused by the racing and overactive thoughts of our mind meditation is a wonderful tool to help quiet the busy mind in the moment and also to practice being able to balance and Center our emotions for future situations you have already taken the most difficult step to helping yourself you have chosen to take time to practice this guided meditation let's begin find a posture of comfort sit or lie down so you can experience ease in your body which will allow for ease in your mind we will start this meditation with your eyes open gently focus your line of vision on one point in front of you you can find a spot on the floor or the wall and now narrow your focus to this one single point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away see all that you can see about this one single point now slowly broaden your field of view like a camera lens widening with a relaxed awareness notice everything you can see in your current much broader line of you without having to turn your head what colors textures and materials do you see do you see brightness or dim light around you [Music] take it all in once more slowly narrow your field of view to the same single point as your focus narrows continue to draw it in until your eyes gradually closed and you invite your attention to turn inward and now start to notice the natural rhythm and depth of your breath without making any changes just notice listen to the sound of your breath look for any movement of your body that is connected to your breath [Music] and now intentionally begin to deepen each breath in and slow down on your exhale as you slow down and deepen your breath take time to notice all there is to experience about your breath [Music] and explore how your breath might change slightly as you continue to look inward [Music] simply notice the experience of your breath without expectations and without judgments what would it be like to offer your breath some love and compassion like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down in relationship to each breath as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen be in the gap no need to do anything simply be in this space without expectations what do you notice in stillness [Music] this is a judgment-free practice of allowing what is there to come to the surface with curiosity [Music] [Music] if you find your mind wandering or your sense of calm begin to dissipate come back to your breath and the gap between thoughts [Music] when we slow down we notice more when we are in the gap we notice what we might otherwise be missing when we rush or overthink experience your body being breathed and let your attention rest on the space between breath and thought [Music] now broaden your awareness to the physical experience of your body look inside and since the energy and feelings of one single point at the area of your stomach what do you notice at this one small focal point [Music] similar to broadening your visual focal point begin to widen the experience of your sensations moving outward from your stomach notice where your body makes a connection with the surface below you perhaps you sense there is a blurring of the lines that separate you from the support and from the energy around you or maybe you feel pressure or warmth at this connection continue gradually moving this relaxed scan of your body helped from your Center notice if there are any parts that are making contact with another part of your body [Music] awaken to the sensations in your body moving out from your Center now since the aliveness in your hands and in your feet [Music] feel the energy moving within you [Music] inhabit your body fully when we can do this live in this body sense our own aliveness we are in the present and living in the space between our thoughts when your mind is attentive to the sensations of your body you can pause you can extend the gap between your thoughts this gap is where you can experience peace and calm notice now if there is anywhere you can soften a little bit more look for any where you can let go even deeper into relaxation and ease let your physical body go so that you can let your thoughts go [Music] imagine your thoughts are like a river flowing gently downstream let your thoughts go so you can be here now awake to the sensations in your body [Music] what would it be like to relax a tense muscle right now what would it feel like to let go of tension and tightness look inside for any areas of your body that are telling you something sometimes the simple act of attending to a sensation allows it to soften or fade away our body wants to be heard to be recognized [Music] invite your attention to move to the areas of your body that are telling you something and feel the sensations there quiet your thoughts to hear the sensations [Music] if you find your mind drifting going back to old patterns of thinking or overthinking lovingly come back gesture your attention to come back to the sensations once more stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment longer knowing that you can always come back to this state of quiet because it has always been a part of you [Music] [Music] take another full breath in and let it out as slowly as you can and do this again letting go of your breath letting go of tension letting go of your busy mind as you brought in your field of awareness once more look for habits or recurring tendencies that you may have to leave your body and come back as many times as you need start over with you're aware presence in life outside of meditation look for patterns when you might be rushing and come back to experience life fully when we slow down and stay with the sensations as long as we can we notice more we live more fully when we are trying to control our life to make it just the way we want it to be perfect we are not experiencing all that life has to offer listen to what wants to be heard see what wants to be seen to do this slow down cause in the gap between thoughts quiet our thoughts to see hear and feel deeply and have it your body fully and be open to life when you were already open your eyes I hope you have a peaceful and calm day thank you for practicing with me

white marble staircase see the staircase in vivid detail you rest your hand on the smooth cool marble banister that runs down beside the staircase as you look down the stairs you notice that there are ten steps leading down these are steps that will lead you deeper into relaxation in a moment as I begin to count you will walk down these steps you will find that the deeper down you go the more comfortable and the more relaxed you will become so now you can hold on to the beautiful banister and begin to slowly descend the stairs as I count 10 you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do eight you know you are right where you need to be on your journey and you allow the outside world to turn off seven this step takes you even deeper into a relaxed state six you are committed to taking your life and dreams to the next level five as you descend you feel the familiar state of freedom in your body and clarity in your mind that comes with this relaxation for going deeper and deeper into comfort three almost to the bottom of the staircase almost to the light two deep deep into relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and now that you have reached the bottom of the staircase you are completely relaxed and comfortable they take a moment to look at your surroundings you realize that the light you see is shining out from behind a partially closed door at the bottom of a staircase it is seeping out from the edges of the door expanding its light outward you have a sense that behind this door is all that you are capable of and all of your inner potential this light is shining out only a little bit allowing only some of your potential to be seen you know that before this door can be opened all the way there are things that you must let go of and now take a moment and first let go of any negativity you may be holding on to this negativity doesn't have to be named specifically just let it go but the energy of negativity go what you put out into the world will come back to you put out positivity send out love and light radiate this energy outward to the world and it will come back to you give what you wish to receive and let go of limiting beliefs of yourself see these beliefs floating away from your body like a feather in the wind and replace the old limiting beliefs with new positive beliefs these limitations we put on ourselves could be holding us back from moving forwards towards our ideal life and towards contentment let it all go let go of any expectations you have of yourself and in any expectations you believe others have for you let go of the need to please anyone but you and take care what others think let go of attachments let it all go let go of competition with yourself and with others let go of the idea of being perfect and the need to always be right let go of the shoulds in your life and replace these thoughts with the idea that you are enough being enough means being comfortable with your body as it is today being comfortable with what you have achieved as well as what you have not being enough means self-acceptance and it is something we could all say to ourselves more often let it all go let go of excuses let go of judgmental thoughts let go of jealousy and thoughts of not enough let go of insecurities let it all go let go of the past in order to move forward let go of worries for the future let go of fear forgive allow the past to be the past and not create your destiny be here now be present be mindful be grateful be joyful and be loved and let go of anything else that is no longer serving you and now that you have let go of all negativity and replaced it with positive love and light now you know it is time to open this door all the way to let the light shine out all the way so you can live to your fullest potential so now reach forward to open the door and as you place your hand on the doorknob and pull all of your inner strength determination and possibilities flow out filling up your mind and the space around you feel the strength and positivity flow out from your mind and fill your entire body and into your heart you are now completely full with potential and possibilities you are confident and capable you are creative and intelligent you are enough and more because you have let go of all the negative in your life you have the space to fill up with your full potential you know you are able to achieve great things now that your inner strength and potential have been released from behind this door and now walk into this light feel the energy and strength of your full potential surrounding you filling you up this energy builds your confidence and motivation on the other side of the door you find a bench to sit down on and you take this new energy confidence and motivation and allow your mind to wander and be imaginative to be open to possibilities and now I'd like you to imagine yourself as a small puzzle piece fitting nicely into the full puzzle that is your life each person in your life is a puzzle piece surrounding you and each fitting perfectly together each facet of your job your family your friends is also part of this puzzle when you change the pieces surrounding you the closest on the puzzle must change as well to stay connected all these changes take time and require patience and some pieces may not fit as well next to your puzzle piece and may need to be switched with another piece that does fit you have the ability in awareness to help this process filter out the pieces that no longer fit as well as have the patience for those pieces that take time to change you are open to change and the opportunities that come with these changes you choose to soften into these possibilities lovingly you live in alignment with your values and you're willing to give a little and be flexible you understand it takes time for changes to happen and take root yet you are grateful for where you are on this journey you know you are exactly where you are supposed to be right now in life we often need to let go of what does not serve us in order to make room for change in order to be open to the process of change this isn't always easy but you are committed to doing what is right for your best interest and what is in alignment with your values rather than what's easy with change comes various emotions and you welcome them and seek to feel them understand them embrace them and then let them go when necessary you don't give up at times of unexpected pain or challenge you persevere all of your thoughts are positive in your mind you repeat after me I am open to change I am worthy of love and success I am confident I am diligent in moving towards my desired success I believe in myself and my abilities I am courageous and brave I am authentically me I am full of joy I am creating my own future I follow my dreams with passion and certainty I let go of the past and focus on the now I am enough I am grateful for today feeling confident and relaxed you get up from the bench and walk back through the doorway to reach the bottom of the stairs as you stand at the bottom of the stairs you have a strong sense that you can achieve whatever it is you set your mind to you know you are capable of achieving your dreams and you have the potential to accomplish great things here today you have let go of negativity and anything that no longer serves you to make space for the new and for the positive you have unlocked your full potential you can feel this energy flowing through you like an energetic life force that was always there but needed to be unlocked you have planted the seeds for

0 in challenging or stressful times it is important to connect with your physical sensations to ground your energy to recognize your emotions as they are and to remember that you are not your thoughts you are not your feelings or your emotions at times you may feel controlled by your thoughts and your emotions as if they become you but just as you walk out in the rain you are not the rain when you are experiencing anxiety you are not the anxiety anxiety is only an experience that you are having there is a big difference in saying to yourself I have anxiety or I am anxious versus saying I am experiencing anxiety in this moment the first statement is claiming that sensation as your own which your mind recognizes as something it wants to hold on to because you are the owner of it today is your time to release stress and anxiety you no longer need to take ownership of it take comfort in the fact that like all moments this moment too shall pass the more you can tenderly offer yourself love and kindness for your experience the less suffering you will experience [Music] thank you for joining me for this practice if you are new here I'm Sara Raymond from the mindful movement and if

through your nose letting it out with a sigh and relax down just a bit further into the surface below you you can close your eyes if you haven't already and with your eyes closed since a gentle wave of relaxation sweeping over your entire body [Music] and as you settle in take a moment to scan through your body and wherever possible soften and release any obvious areas of physical tension [Music] now allow your attention to rest on your natural breath notice your breath as it arises and as it passes [Music] for the next several breath cycles I will guide you to begin counting your breath in and creating a humming sound on your exhale to begin this practice breathe out completely breathe in for a count of four then hold your breath for a count of two and then allow your exhale to slowly be released while producing a humming sound [Music] do this again breathe in four three two one hold to one and breathe out slowly while humming [Music] and continue this on your own [Music] and as you do know that it may take a few cycles to find a rhythm that works for you you can adjust the length of your inhale and the hold to suit your comfort level [Music] this is your safe opportunity to make a natural noise and feel the vibrations of sound without judgments of how it sounds [Music] invite this practice to be soothing and allow your mind and your body to drift into a very calm State as you continue take this time to remind yourself that you are safe notice the vibration of the sound [Music] [Music] and now allow your breath to normalize and notice how relaxed you have become you can let go of the controlled breathing pattern and now simply sense that you are receiving the breath just as you would be receiving any sounds you hear [Music] with a relaxed awareness discover what each breath is really like [Music] attending to your breath is like coming home to yourself coming home to a place where you can rest you can simply relax as each breath comes in notice what it's like

relaxing scan of your body guiding your attention to move strategically throughout your body to ground and restore your energy for the most tranquil experience you can rest assured your body is safe and supported and knows exactly what to do to relax so give yourself permission to relax fully as your attention moves through the areas of your body send the quality of love to each area become aware

0 This is a 5-minute “breathing space” practice that you can use anytime, anywhere to regain calm, clarity and confidence.  To begin, become physically still, wherever you are, either lying, sitting, or standing.  Choose a posture where you’ll be as comfortable as possible, and lightly close your eyes.  Bring your awareness to whatever is going on for you right now.  Give the weight of your body up to gravity.  Allow your weight to sink into the points of contact between your body and the floor, the chair, or bed.  What sensations are there right now?  If you notice any tension or resistance towards painful or unpleasant sensations, gently turn towards them.  Accept them as best you can.  If you begin to tense around the breath, then let go a little bit more with each outbreath.  Soften into gravity.  Notice any thoughts as they arise and pass through the mind.
0 Begin by finding a comfortable, relaxed position.  Allow your body to begin to relax.  Breathe in.... and out.....  Take a cleansing breath in.... and breathe out the tension in your body....  Feel relaxation beginning at the bottom of your feet. It might feel like stepping into a warm bathtub... or it may feel like a tingling sensation.... or simply calm and loose. Allow the relaxation to spread over your feet, and up to your ankles.  Feel the relaxation rising above your ankles, flowing up your lower legs.... to your knees.... continuing up to your upper legs...  Allow the relaxation to continue to spread throughout your body, rising now to your hips and pelvic area....  to your stomach and lower back.....  to your chest and upper back....  Let your upper arms relax.... your elbows.... lower arms.... and wrists... feel the relaxation spread to your hands... relaxing the palms of your hands.... the back of your hands.... each finger and thumb.... your hands feel pleasantly warm, heavy, and relaxed.  Feel your body relaxing further as the area by your collar bones widens and relaxes.... allow your shoulders to ease back slightly....  Allow your upper back to relax even further.... let your shoulders relax.... and your neck....  Feel the relaxation continue to spread to your chin... the back of your head.... your mouth.... your cheeks..... nose.... eyes....  Feel your eyelids, heavy and relaxed....  Notice your eyebrows relaxing.... your ears relaxing.... and your forehead.....  Your forehead feels cool and relaxed.....  Let the relaxation spread further to the top of your head....  Your entire body now is relaxed and calm. Feel the relaxation flowing throughout your body, from your head to your feet.  You can relax even further as you let your spine relax completely. Starting where the top of your spine meets your head, feel the relaxation.... feel the muscles giving up their hold and relaxing....  Feel the relaxation spread down your spine... down your neck.... upper back.... middle back .... and lower back.... all the way down to your tailbone at the bottom of your spine...  Notice all of the muscles of your back relaxing completely....  Feel the relaxation flowing throughout your body.  Breathe in.... now hold that breath. And relax your muscles totally, allowing the breath to flow gently out your nose or mouth.  Take another deep breath, breathing in relaxation....  And release the breath. Breathe out any remaining tension.  Continue to breathe smoothly and slowly as you mentally scan your body, looking for any remaining tension.  If you notice any tension, focus on that area. Direct the relaxation to flow into that area, and then carry the tension away.  Imagine that the air you are breathing can cleanse your body and remove tension. Imagine that each breath in carries relaxation. Picture the tension in your body leaving with each breath out.  Now simply relax, calmly, enjoying the feeling of relaxation for a few moments.  (pause)  Focus your attention now on your body, and think about the healing that needs to take place.  Create an image in your mind of your current state of being. Imagine the physical ailment that troubles you. It might be pain, or illness, or injury. It might be something diagnosed, or it may be a problem that is not yet identified. Whatever it is that you would like to heal, imagine this problem in your mind right now.  Focus on the specific location in your body where this problem is present.  You might want to imagine the problem as a dark area, and picture the healing relaxation as light. See the light of relaxation flowing through your body. Direct the light of healing relaxation toward the dark area.  Your body has many ways of healing itself. See the healing relaxation promoting your immune system.... promoting strength... promoting growth of healthy tissue.... removing unhealthy matter from your body.... removing toxins, bacteria, or waste.... cleaning up your body....  Imagine the light of healing relaxation flowing, swirling, touching the edges of the dark problem area in your body.  You might notice small pieces of the dark area being carried away by the healing relaxation.... allow these dark pieces to leave your body as you breathe out.  Breathe in health, healing, and calm....  Breathe out tension, illness, and any problems in your body....  Allow the light healing relaxation to continue swirling around the dark problem area... see the dark area getting smaller...  Imagine the dark area completely enveloped by relaxation....  See the healing relaxation making the dark area lighter.... and lighter... carrying away anything that is not good for your body....  Imagine your immune system working to heal you.... picture the cells you need going to the places they need to go.... working as needed to heal your body.....  Imagine the healing relaxation flowing, coursing through your body.....  Picture your body entirely filled with relaxation....  See the problem area your body is healing.... see it becoming even lighter.... filled with relaxation.... carrying away any discomfort..... healing.....  Allow your body to heal itself....  Take a cleansing breath in.... and breathe out what your body does not need....  Breathe in relaxation.... breathe out all the old air....  Relax for a few moments and imagine the healing process going on inside your body.... feeling confident in your body's ability to heal.... feeling calm and at peace....  (pause)  Now you can choose to return to your usual level of wakefulness and alertness, or drift into sleep.  If you choose to awaken, feel your body and mind becoming more aware of your surroundings.
0 Hello, and welcome to this meditation to relieve depression and anxious thoughts.  Make sure you are in a comfortable position and you will not be disturbed for the duration of this session.  Bring your focus to your breath, and really pay attention to how your lungs expand and contract when you inhale and exhale.  Let your breath flow how ever it wants to right now.  Notice your jaw, and if you feel any tension here, just notice it, don’t try to change anything.  Now breathe into the sensations in your jaw, and as you exhale, allow it to release a little.  Inhale again, imagine that you are breathing in new life, and when you exhale, let all fear completely fade.  Take another breath in, and when you exhale, feel yourself let go of any worries.  Notice how relaxed you are becoming right now.  Let another breath come in naturally imagining a bright future, and as you let it go, notice how depression eases and fades.  A gentle wave of relaxation sweeps over you as you breathe in and out.  Allow your breath to flow naturally now, let yourself feel calm and peaceful.  You deserve this wonderful feeling of serenity.  You are open now to receive new thoughts, and you open up even more with each breath you take to new and fresh energy.  Notice how new ideas begin to present themselves to you.  Bring up feelings of abundance, as if you have so much that your cup pours over for others to enjoy the abundance you have created.  Imagine that you are energized and have a zeal for life. 
0 you're listening to power thoughts meditation club thank you for being here i wonder now if you can imagine a tree outside an autumn imagine the leaves changing color from green yellow red brown and as time goes by more and more leaves just release from the tree letting go naturally and when winter comes the tree stands there without the leaves some people look at that tree and think that there's no life there i wonder if they've thought of all the life inside that tree all the processes going on inside that tree because when the spring comes the new fresh green leaves grow out again if it hadn't been for the autumn being there there would have been no room for the new green fresh sleeves i'm sorry and it's good to know that your subconscious mind works the same way naturally and safely it releases the old and i wonder now if you can allow yourself to access that deeper inner part of you that is calm serene and focused in your imagination everything is possible i'm sorry and the way you imagine your mental pictures the way you hear sounds and feel emotions and body sensations through this process now that is the right way for you to do this so imagine now that directly in front of you is a piece of pure quartz crystal just let your mind focus on that image see its shape texture and beauty and as you do so there is a warm gentle light that begins to glow within the crystal which grows brighter and more luminous as you focus on its energy you become aware of the crystal beginning to grow imagine now growing larger and larger brighter and brighter i'm sorry until the crystal is the size of a small house i am sorry its light pours out from each facet of the crystal and bathes you with warmth and gentleness making you feel so relaxed so peaceful and so calm you begin to explore the crystals in more detail and find now that there is a door which leads into the crystal the door is slightly open allowing a brighter gold light to flow out from the opening gently open the door so that you can walk into the crystal you have stepped into a crystal room which is there just for you this is your own special place the room can be in any shape or size you wish it to be just allow your imagination to create the rule as you want it to be in the colors that you love and feel peaceful with make it as comfortable as you want it to be it is your room i'm sorry please imagine that you look around the room and realize that you have not been in this place for a very long time a film of dust and debris has dulled the brightness of the crystal room so that the light cannot shine as brightly as it should in one corner of the room is a brew imagine now taking hold of the broom i'm sorry start sweeping up all dust and debris sweep it all out of the door and as the dust is swept outside imagine it being transformed bright glittering stardust and the debris is being absorbed into the golden light where it is transformed into positive vibrant energy imagine the dust and debris being negative thoughts that you now choose to let go of you can be at peace now as more and more of the dust and the breeze is swept away out of that door the light within the crystal room glows brighter and brighter so that you are surrounded now by a warm golden glow making you feel safe calmly and relaxed continue sweeping your room till every wall every facet every part of the floor is sparkling and clean clear and pure spring waters and while you are sweeping all your old negative thoughts they are being absorbed into the golden light where it is transformed into positive vibrant energy it is safe now to release these old thoughts and worries into the light and now repeat silently after me i choose to safely release these old unresourceful thoughts and worries with compassion and forgiveness knowing that whatever solution is necessary will manifest when the time is right repeat this to yourself so that you feel it with your whole being please feel the release let them go you can suddenly repeat after me now i am safe i choose think positive thoughts i choose to be free i allow myself to feel good i choose to focus on the positive side of life no matter how thick or thin you slice a bread you always have two sides i allow myself to heal from the inside out i choose to think thoughts that supports my life i allow myself to smile no matter where i am who i'm with what i do i choose to feel optimistic and focused i choose to let go of the old to make room for the new i am a part of nature i'm deep inside i am aware my thoughts create my reality therefore i choose my thoughts wisely i'm sorry from now on i allow myself to feel light and free i am worthy imagine now that you have completed to remove the debris and dust out of the room transformed into that light i'm sorry glittering stardust the imagine inside your room now there is a sofa bed i am walk towards the sofa bed lie down to rest in comfort now as you do so the golden light within the crystal room surrounds you bringing you peace calm and healing just rest for a while now with this nurturing golden light absorbing whatever your body needs for its healing at this time and your subconscious mind will integrate all these positive words i've told you i'm so unsafe and natural way perhaps there is someone you know to whom you wish to send loving and healing thoughts to or some situation that you feel may benefit from healing light take a few moments now to send out healing thoughts to anyone or anything that comes into your awareness now just allow this to happen if it's okay send your unconditional love and healing from your heart now so now that you have rested healed imagine getting up from the sofa bed and move slowly towards the door of the room taking your time to look around at this lovely bright place knowing that you can return here at any time reflect on how beautiful and luminous the light is in this room and store that knowledge in your heart knowing that this beautiful luminous light reflects your own inner light that beautiful unique part of you walk back through the door and imagine that the crystal begins to shrink in size shrinking more and more until it's just a tiny pin of light in your mind's eye you can access this place whenever you want to you can think about that quartz crystal light the brightness and whenever you need to heal whenever you need to feel good whenever you need to feel free come into your room inhale and every time you listen to my voice every time you listen to these words your unconscious mind will integrate this deeper and deeper within you at night when you sleep in your dreams these positive words will be compounded to be stronger and stronger and you'll feel better and better and you're doing good thank you for being here you're doing good i'm gonna do a count now from one to five if you choose to open your eyes you can do that safely if you choose to just relax further just

0 Hey there, and welcome to this meditation to help you reduce anxiety. First, I'd like to invite you to gently close your eyes and take a nice, slow, deep breath in, deeper than you've taken all day so far. And as you exhale, concentrate on the sound of my voice, allowing it to ground you into the present moment, and giving yourself permission right now to focus on you, making yourself your first priority. There is nowhere else you need to be. There is nothing else you need to be doing. For the next several minutes, your wellbeing is your focus. Continue to take slow, deep breaths, allowing each inhale to be a bit deeper than the one before it. Feeling your lungs expand out as you inhale, holding it for a beat and contracting back in as you exhale. And as you continue to breathe this way, feel the journey of the breath through your body and notice any places where you may be holding stress or anxiety in your body. Unfurl your brow, unclench your jaw. Let your shoulders drop down from your ears. Open your palms. And now allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm and pattern, but keep your focus on it and allow it to be your anchor during this meditation. If you get distracted by a thought or a sound, simply acknowledge that it occurred and then gently let it go and return your attention to your breath. When we're stressed or anxious about something, it's often because we don't feel we have control over it, and the sense of being out of control can make us feel less safe, and our emotions heighten. An understandable reaction to this is that we try to control the situation even further. We also tend to judge the situation and even our feelings about it. Those judgments and the stories we tell ourselves about it often become bigger than the situation itself, which adds on even more stress, and the cycle repeats. So right now, I invite you to call to mind a situation that you feel is causing you anxiety. What judgments are you holding about it? As you name the judgment, acknowledge its presence. Now give the judgment permission to drop away. You don't need it anymore. Let it go. And what's the story you've been telling yourself about the situation? As you recognize it, acknowledge its presence and give that story permission to drop away as well. You may notice your mind pushing you even harder to hold onto those judgments or those stories. Recognize and acknowledge those thoughts too, and now allow them to drop away as well. Continue to use your breath to anchor yourself back in the present moment if you get distracted. Now let's look at that situation again without the judgment or the story you were telling yourself. How does it feel different? Has the level of anxiety or stress changed? Instead, I invite you to look at the situation with total curiosity. Now, as we move into the silent part of the meditation, give yourself permission to open up to the clarity and direction on what the very next step for you to take is. Not the next five or 10 steps, not all the steps to the end, just the very next step. And continue breathing with your eyes closed. Just let your attention start to focus back on my voice. Our judgments of and stories we tell ourselves about a situation tend to exaggerate our feelings of unease, anxiety and stress. They can skew what's actually going on out of proportion and they can block us from seeing the truth of the situation and allowing in the ease and comfort we so desire. So the next time you're feeling anxious, remember to breathe and then notice and acknowledge the judgements about it and the story behind it. And then let them drop away and notice how the anxiousness eases. Focus on the truth of the situation in this moment. You have everything you need right now. Now let's take three more deep breaths together. Take a deep inhale in, holding that breath for a beat and exhale it out. Again, an even deeper breath than the one before, feeling it weave in and out of your muscles and cells and exhale it out. Last time, your deepest breath yet sending that oxygen all the way through your entire body. And when it reaches the top of your head and you're ready, you can open your eyes. Thanks for joining me for this meditation and for giving yourself this gift. Have a great rest of your day.
0 this is a meditation on depression it is not meant to fight against depression or hide from it but to sit with it and learn to develop a relationship with these feelings there are many dark and painful feelings you may be experiencing right now it may be that elusive feeling of hopelessness that seems to permeate your thoughts and maybe a feeling of meaninglessness without motivation or purpose it may just be an unexplainable sadness the Sun rises and sets and the days go on but you feel stuck lost trapped in a dark pit depression can feel like a black ink that soaks through your consciousness but there is hope there is always a tiny sliver of light that is waiting in the distance to take you back even if it may not feel that way in the moment or even if it hasn't felt that way for quite some time although you may feel yourself return only in small slow increments this meditation is intended to take you on a journey back to your life back to inner stillness and peace finding a light within the darkness so let's begin allow yourself to sit or lay comfortably with your hands resting gently at your sides or on your legs you may choose to gently shut your eyes or keep them softly focused until they become so heavy that you can no longer hold them open as you get yourself comfortable in these first few moments allow your attention to draw itself to your breathing begin taking slow deep breaths in through your nostrils and start to think to yourself simply in out but every breath in and out and if it feels good to you every once in a while take an extra deep breath and just hold it for a second then slowly exhale in a long comforting release and just fill yourself otherwise breathe naturally as you begin to settle in we'll start by counting down from five and with each number just take a slow healing breath and think to yourself the short phrase focused and relaxed so begin now with breath in five and exhale focused and relax four focused and relaxed your breathing changes during this it's perfectly fine three focused and relaxed two focused and relaxed and one focused and relaxed just let a feeling of peacefulness wash over you your head may be becoming heavy your eyes may push too close if they have not already every muscle relaxing your body sinking deep deep into the surface just continue to keep a gentle and steady breath notice notice now your entire body let me feel a slight tingling in your arms or hands or legs you may even get a sensation of the blood flowing throughout your body or notice your heartbeat you may also notice yourself within your surrounding space or even begin to feel yourself slowly connecting with it almost becoming one instead of a separate entity with everything around you now we will count down once again and this time begin to just imagine a a bright healing light in front of you even golfing you and surrounding you and with each breath just think that phrase healing light and see it now five healing light and end for healing light and specializing see it clearly feel it around you 3 healing light so vivid to healing light healing every nerve in your body and one healing light now as you further draw attention to your body and your relationship with all that's around you just bring awareness to the very top of your head and as you take another calming breath allow a sensation of relaxing energy to flow down your head down your head and through your neck and your shoulders maybe just a slight tingling sensation we also enjoy a pleasant sensation behind your eyes I'm just allowing a soothing weight to push down on them as your head gains that feeling of heaviness feel that tingling wave move slowly down your arms through your elbows and wrists and out the very tips of your fingers continuing to breathe slowly and calmly feel it creep back up and then down to your chest slowly down your door so gently breathing and finally ever so slowly down your legs down your legs and out the tips of your toes peeling that warm calming energy just flowing throughout your body and on these next breaths just pretend that you're standing elsewhere in the room watching your own body within the space and see yourself and visualize it and imagine that you see a warm glowing lights around you now on the next several breaths you will feel that heavy pressure of weight come down on you more and more enjoy this feeling this heavy feeling as you take a breath in can count with me five and out heavy weight heavy weight and for heavyweight throughout your whole body three heavyweight each breath in makes you feel heavier weighed down to each sound of my voice makes you feel heavier sinking sinking deep into the surface and one heavy weight this continue to bring focus to your breath and to my words feeling that heaviness pulling your downward into the floor your muscles just relax and give into it all down down down and as you reach the fullness of this weight take just one minute to soak in this heavy feeling concentrate on that warm glow and give yourself into the words that follow just relax for one minute what your mind creates is not you this depression is feelings it it's not you it has you in its grasp your suffering is real but hopelessness is not real the pain that you're running from and running from is real but the prison bars that you feel trapped behind are not real can you overcome this nightmare can you wake up find your way out of this dark pit from this lonely isolated place that you find yourself in you can and you will and you will wait and practice and hang on to hope because it is there for the taking it is not lost you can escape and you will keep imagining yourself in this warm glow but imagine imagine it change in hue it's a vibrant red around you and then slowly slowly that becomes a bright blue a bright glowing blue and the energy it begins flowing through you as you notice every nerve every limb every part of your body is one within this space energy warm blue glow of light flowing through you and now lastly as I count you will feel this weight slowly and gently begin to lift five you may suddenly see and visualize the vastness and openness of the sky in space for even beginning to levitate becoming lighter and lighter your arms become feathers and you throw off the heavy anvils a surface below you disappears three you see yourself no longer bound by gravity or this room breathing in and out as that glow brightens and it turns into an almost blinding white to lighter and lighter fearless alive free lighter and lighter floating floating up into the vastness of the universe and with one more revitalizing breath I count you to one weightless floating here in the vastness of space and time allow yourself two more minutes just two more minutes to float in this open world within your mind and allow yourself to search for these answers that you so desperately know are within you give yourself just two minutes healing is not instant wounds take time to heal but believe in your healing believe in your meaning and purpose you are still you you are still alive you are here you are okay you are okay this concludes our meditation so please return whenever you are lost and whenever you are ready
0 - Hi, I'm Anisa Benitez, and we'll be doing a guided meditation to reduce anxiety, so find yourself a comfortable seated position, and we'll get started. Bringing your hands to your kneecaps or your lap and taking the first deep breath, in through our nose, (inhales) and out through our mouth, closing our eyes. Again, follow your breath, taking a deep inhale through your nose, and out through your mouth. (gentle ambient music) Follow your breath, taking another deep inhale through your nose, and exhaling through your mouth. And observe the breath. Sometimes we notice that our breathing is not as deep as we thought it was. We might be breathing shallow breaths throughout the day. So how can you take more notice of what it feels like right now, to be breathing as deeply as you are? Now we're gonna hold our breath for a beat at the top. Taking a deep inhale through our nose, inhaling one, two, three, four, holding our breath, one, two, three, four, and exhaling one, two, three, four. Again, inhale through your nose, one, two, three, four, hold that breath, one, two, three, four, and release one, two, three, four. Allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and see how it feels now that you're breathing deeply at the top of your head. Bring your awareness and your attention to the top of your head. If there's tension in your forehead, how can you take a deep breath in and out and feel tension release there? Sometimes you might be holding tension because of concern or worry. Scrunching our forehead to send some breath and awareness there. Take another deep inhale and continue to bring your awareness down your body as we do this progressive relaxation technique known as body scanning. Bringing our awareness now to our cheeks. Maybe it was a day of smiling, a day of talking a lot. How can you bring your attention there and release any tension that might be there in your jawline? Continuing to follow your breath, taking a deep inhale in and exhaling. Bring your awareness down from your jaw to your throat. How can you send a deep breath there? And upon exhaling, feel the tension release from your throat. Maybe there is words unsaid that you might be holding in from the day. How can you feel that tension relax there in your throat? Continuing to make your awareness graze down your body, and while it does so, releasing any tension, stress that we might be carrying in our body. Now in our shoulders, it's so common that we hike up our shoulders. Maybe 'cause of cold, maybe 'cause of tenseness. How can you send a deep breath there and feel your shoulders release and come down? Feel your neck elongate. Continuing to bring your attention down your body, down your spine to your sitz bones, and send a deep breath there. Oftentimes, focusing at the base of our body helps us feel grounded. So take a deep inhale through your nose, and exhale, sending a big breath there. Feeling the tension release, feeling ourselves sink into the earth, feeling ourselves grounded in this moment. Continuing to bring our awareness down our thighs, down our calves, into our ankles, to her toes, to our feet in contact with the floor maybe, and send a deep breath there. Really feeling yourself grounded in this moment. In this moment. Again, take a deep inhale through your nose, the deepest that you've taken all day, and releasing the deepest exhale of all day. And when you're ready, bring your attention back to your surroundings, away from your breath, but know that you can always come back here. Open your eyes. And thank you for taking the time to tune into yourself, to tune into your breath, to feel grounded in this moment. I'm Anisa Benitez, and I appreciate you.

0 I will be guiding you to be an observer of where you are in this present moment to slow down and go within to be curious about your physical sensations as well as your emotional well-being oftentimes all it takes is stepping back from a situation where the habit is reaction so you can simply be aware of a moment and respond more in alignment with your true self and what is important to you you can see the present moment for what it is and Trust the journey I invite you to make yourself comfortable and find a posture of effortless ease where you can be relaxed yet alert you may choose to lie down or sit up when you are comfortable close your eyes or soften your gaze to bring your attention inward as you settle into comfort bring your attention to your breath in a moment I will guide you to take several deep breaths counting your inhale and making your exhale one count longer than your inhale before you do this first observe the quality of the state you are in without making any changes or judging where you are just check in are you calm what is your heart rate like in this moment what is the depth of your natural breath what are the sensations you are experiencing in your body are you warm or cool what else is your attention drawn to as an observer of your state after noticing your current state begin to mindfully inhale and count the length of this breath then extend your exhale one count longer than your inhale and practice this for the next few moments let go of this counting breath and allow your breathing to return to its natural pace and then scan your body once more what is there for you now are there any differences in the quality of your state your heart rate or the sensations in your body now look for anywhere that you can let go of the tendency to hold on is there anywhere in your physical body that you can let go or any emotions that you are holding on to let them go to let go of tension let go of tightness or pain let go of the need to control or hold your posture often we are in fight-or-flight mode or under physical or emotional stress and we aren't even aware of it today right now I invite you to find more ease can you let go of stress and welcome yourself into the rest and digest mode what would it feel like in your body to experience peace to find calm to be still breathe this in experience this right now the stillness this calm state is a time to go within much like winter is a time of unseen growth a time of presumed dormant life or inactivity trust your journey Trust the journey of the seasons winter is a time to turn inward to connect with yourself to be curious about what is there for you you may sense the need to slow down to lower the intensity to rest and prepare for what is to come listen to your body to your instincts what is there for you right now the symbolism of winter invites us to quiet the mind it invites us to wrap up in warmth and find stillness of our soul to seek out serenity this is a time of introversion contemplation and going within see the still state of the life in this season and trust that there will be growth once more see the blessing in the quiet and calm of the winter see the hope for the future of the seasons to come as you look inward what is there for you right now life nature and every person experiences a natural ebb and flow an inhalation period as well as an exhalation period life is the balance of giving and receiving of expending energy and conserving energy during the winter season it is a time to withdraw conserve and rest the expenditure of energy is minimal this is the season that we experienced the longest day of the year and then the return of the light and the lengthening of daylight it is the season during which our energies are naturally drawn inward when we are inclined to be more contemplative give yourself permission to slow down to dream to go within your dreams may be blurry and not fully formed right now plant the seeds of intention for your dreams then open your field of awareness and look for signs look for your dreams to solidify in time be open to the possibilities as they arise as you take your winter season to rest and go inward invite yourself to dream dream of the person you would like to be dream of the qualities you would like to embody dream of your intentions dream of your ideal life letting your imagination run wild with all your senses as if your dream came true in this present moment feel it in your body as if it were true you may see this dream this ideal life in your mind or simply experience the energy of this dream what is coming up for you now breathe this in now plant the seeds for this life now out of these intentions and dreams will come beauty in the seasons ahead out of the stillness and peace will come a balance of energy an exhalation period be patient and listen to what your body is telling you now listen to what your soul needs now [Music] sit with these dreams and intentions for a few minutes longer feel that they are there within you preparing for the future even in this time of stillness take in another deep breath as you bring your awareness to the sensations of your body and the energy of your surroundings since the energy building within you once more knowing that out of this time of stillness comes growth you have taken this time to go inward to dream to solidify your intentions when you are ready open your eyes open to the possibilities of what these intentions will bring open your field of awareness now trust the journey listen observe and be patient look for the seasons to change the energy to shift trust the journey [Music] the love and light and me honors the love and light in you
0 - Howdy pal, and welcome to Yoga with Adriene. I'm Adriene and today we have a meditation for you to help you with anxiety. Happens to the best of us. It can get out of control fast. So, thank you for joining me in this meditation to help quell and soften and maybe even cure you from regular anxiety attacks. Hope into something comfy and let's get started. (gentle music) Alright, my sweet friends, so we're going to begin by finding a comfortable seat and what was a comfortable seat yesterday or where you may end up years from now in your meditation practice or just in your body is just always right in a constant state of flux for so many reasons. So, I'd like to invite you today to really consider what's gonna feel best. If it's leaning up against a wall, snuggle up against a wall. If it's sitting on the edge of your couch or participating in a chair, fabulous. Or you can lie down, you can practice this meditation lying down. So, we definitely wanna come to a place where we feel comfortable and safe to do this brief meditation and to practice the breath, the pranayama, and so today, just an extra gentle nudge to find a comfortable seat and really be honest about that. So, if it's not Sukhasana today, find something that feels supportive and good. For those coming into Sukhasana, you can even play with the legs here, one foot in front of the other, maybe give yourself a nice wide base. So, we'll all come into a position that we feel is the most supportive of us today. Again, it can be lying down. And when you arrive there, really choose to arrive by acknowledging, oh I chose to turn on this video, I made the choice to tend to what's going on, and the first position that I'm even taking here was also a choice to feel supported and comfortable. So, basically we're shifting gears a little bit from a mindset that might feel a little bit anxious or off, and we're starting to get organized in the brain and body and say, okay, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, I have some power here, a lotta power to help guide myself out of that which doesn't feel good and to help guide myself to a place that feels more supported. So, hopefully by now, you found your seat for today, whatever it may be, your place where you are going to reside, and when you arrive there, you can use the sound of my voice now as a guide, so close your eyes and just bring some awareness to your chest, your heart space, and depending on where you're at today, my sweet friend, you might already start to lean in and just feel what's comin' up, let the emotional body have a seat at the table and just notice. And wherever you are today, see if you can begin to do just that, notice. Come into the role of the observer. So, I find it very helpful to close the eyes, relax the shoulders, and bring your awareness to your heart center or your chest area and just allow whatever feelings come up, whatever thoughts, just notice them. And then notice where you might be holding or gripping in the body, the fingers or the toes, the ankles or the wrists, and see if you can use this idea of the observer to just notice all of those points and then in time to allow just the noticing to bring a softness, an awareness. So, your only real job here in this practice today is to pay attention. We use Pranayama technique to help guide the energy of the body and to hopefully help relieve you from feelings that are not serving, if you feel stuck or off or anxious, stressed out. Hopefully, the Pranayama will allow us to just shift our perspective or break the pattern that we might be stuck in. So, after you've taken a couple moments to just arrive here and settle in, acknowledge that you chose this, start to notice your breath. You don't have to do anything, just acknowledge it, notice the natural ebb and flow. Notice what it feels like as you breathe in and notice what it feels like as you empty the breath out. And then again, bring your awareness to your chest again, your heart space, this place that tends to get really tight and collapsed when we feel anxiety, and see if you can start to lift up through that area, even if it's not a big muscular movement but just a little energy. Then allow that to affect your breath, maybe taking a more fuller inhale, feeling the heart lift a little, then perhaps feeling the shoulders relax and soften as you breathe out. So, the neck and shoulders also get a lot of tension, a little tightness when we feel anxious, so use your inhale to feel expansion, and as you start to deepen the breath, use your exhale to find a softness, a surrender. Alright, you're doing great. Stay with it, stick with it, eyes closed, shoulders relaxed, lots of awareness around your heart center, your chest, your sternum. On your next inhale, see if you can bring the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth now, just right behind the teeth, and breathe in, and then breathe out, jaw nice and soft. Again, the tip of the tongue comes to the roof of the mouth and we breathe in. The jaw stays soft, not clinched, as you breathe out. And on your next inhale, we're gonna count to four. Breathe in for four. Here we go. Tongue comes to the roof of the mouth. And we inhale, one, two, three, four, and then just let it go soft and easy. Inhale for four, one, two, three, four, and then let it go. Notice how you feel, stay present, keep observing. Adding onto this ratio, now we're going to hold the breath, retain the breath in between the inhalation and the exhalations for a seven count. So, we'll do one breath cycle, just in and out, and then we'll start with the four. So, breathe in deep here, nice, soft, easy breath. And exhale just to relax the shoulders, empty everything out. I'm breathing in for four. Inhale, one, two, three, four, holding, retaining the breath for seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, and let everything go. Notice what thoughts come up, stay present, let it unfold. Try to keep the body still. And the last bit of the ratio is an exhale for eight. So, we'll inhale for four, I'll guide you with my voice. We'll hold at the top, retaining the breath mindfully for seven and then a nice smooth exhalation on the eight. Four, seven, eight. Soften through your fingertips and toes. One breath cycle, in and out to start, and then we'll begin. Here we go, inhale. Empty it all out. And inhaling for four, inhale, one, two, three, four. Holding for seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And exhale for eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Just notice how you did, no judgment, just observing. Inhaling for four, inhale, one, two, three, four. Retaining on seven, six, five, four, three, you got this, two, one. And big exhale, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Inhale for four, three, two, one. Retain for seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And exhale for eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one. Inhale for four, three, two, one. Retain, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Exhale for eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one. Let everything go. Stay with it. Notice what comes up. Reside in that wonderful role of the observer. And wherever you are, whether you're seated in a chair or Sukhasana or lying down, you're gonna find soft, easy movement with the neck. So, if you're lying down, you might rock the head gently side to side. You might shake the head yes and then no. And then you'll start to bat the eyelashes open. Soft, easy movement with the neck and shoulders. And then we'll take a big inhale in and exhale, sigh it out, so this is important, little big of sound here. Inhale in. Sigh it out. (sighs) And one more time, inhale. (deeply sighs) Hands come together, notice how you feel. Thank you for sharing your time and your energy and your practice with me and all the people around the globe participating, working towards a happy, healthy balanced life. Namaste. (gentle music)
0 This is a guided mindfulness  meditation on feeling overwhelmed. Take a mental step back from whatever you are feeling right now. Allow yourself to be comfortable and to take some slow and natural breaths. In and out... In and out... Feel your breath and body in your space. Recognize that for just a bit, you get to find a comforting space, here, in your time. Just you in your space... ...hearing my voice. Enjoying each moment. Enjoying your presence. Feeling okay with everything just as it is. Just for now. Again feeling so relaxed and comfortable with your body here in this space. And taking natural gentle  breaths as your focal point. We wouldn't be human if there  weren't times in our lives when our hearts and minds became overwhelmed with a weight that we are carrying. These feelings can come from many places. But it is important to know that it  is okay and natural to feel this way. What we can practice is improving a relationship  between these thoughts and emotions. And recognize a response to them. A still and calm mind can bring  us back into the present moment and to tame that heavy weight that can feel as if it reaches  all the way into our soul. That still mind can tame that voice in our head that says the pressure or pain or expectations put upon us are too much for us to handle. Practicing this mindful meditation  allows us to take a gentle step back and see the bigger picture. Just as a violent storm will eventually clear to become stillness. There is a stillness underneath. We can be reminded of the important phrase: "This, too, shall pass." And so, I invite you to focus on lifting  that weight from your mind by sharing these short phrases with me. Feel free to repeat them after me, either out loud or in your mind. Taking your time with each one and allowing the words and meaning to  sink deeply into your consciousness. And so, continuing that breath and body focus, we begin now: "I recognize stress and anxiety." "Like a heavy weight upon me." "I watch and understand it." "I allow myself to let go." "Feeling the weight lifting." "Floating away." "Floating away." "Calm and serene." "Still and present." "Right here and right now." Fantastic. That is the end of the phrases. And did you feel the weight lifting? The burden just a bit lighter on your shoulders. This may take time and may not be an instant cure, but it will help you to step outside of yourself and understand where this weight of these  overwhelmed feelings are coming from. It allows us to purposefully sort our thoughts and more clearly see a path forward. And so, enjoying this time, continuing that gentle breath  and body relaxation focus, I will just read these phrases one after another. You are invited to just listen to them and for any tension that remains, I will help you to escape it. Then I will finish up the  session, just a few minutes after. "Recognize any remaining stress and anxiety." "Like a heavy weight upon you." "Watch and understand it." "Allow yourself to let it go." "Feeling the weight lifting." "Floating away." "Floating away." "Calm and serene." "Still and present." "Right here and right now." This will soon conclude this session. And if you like, take a few last deep breaths, do some shoulder or neck circles, maybe stretch out your arms. Just prepare yourself to finish up this session and to continue on into the  next part of your day or night. Be well, be at peace, be present and mindful of your stress and anxiety. If overwhelming feelings start to overcome you, just remind yourself of how  you can let go of the weight like a helium balloon. Floating away, leaving you calm and serene. Becoming still and present, right here and right now. So long for now.
0 Hello, my loves. Welcome to a Guided Meditation by Lavendaire. I'm happy you made the choice to meditate today  and nurture your body, mind, and soul. Let's get into a comfortable seated position. Bring your hands together and take a moment for gratitude. Close your eyes. What are you grateful for in the now? No matter what you are going through, you can always find gratitude in simplicity. I am grateful for life. I'm grateful to breathe. I am grateful for this moment of peace. Release your hands back to your knees. Take a deep breath with an open mouth exhale. On your next deep inhale, bring your shoulders up, and open mouth exhale, gently bring your shoulders down. Repeat this two more times. Feel the tension and burden release with each exhale. Deep inhale, bring your shoulders up, exhale, gently bring them down. Inhale, bring your shoulders up, and exhale, gently bring them down. Take a deep breath to reset and notice how your body feels.   Now, let's release tension from the neck. Take a deep breath in and on your exhale, bring your chin down to stretch the back of your neck. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your hands behind your head. Hold here for two full breaths. On your next exhale, bring your chin to neutral and face forward.   Then breathe in and tilt your head up to stretch the front of your neck.   Hold here for two full breaths, relaxing your mouth for your exhales. Then reset and face forward on your next exhale.  Onto side neck stretches. Gently tilt your head to the right and hold there for three deep breaths. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your right hand on your head.   Reset on your third breath.   Now do the opposite side. Tilt your head slowly to the left and hold there for three deep breaths. Reset on your next exhale. Take this time to do a couple neck circles on each side. While inhaling, slowly roll your head to the right, then back. And then exhale to the left and then down. Gently, at your own pace, do one more round, inhaling for the first half and exhaling for the second half. Now switch directions. Slowly circle your neck the other way, inhaling to the left, to the back, and exhaling to the right and then back down. Repeat for one more round. When you're done, take a deep breath and open mouth exhale to reset. Notice how your body feels now. Feel the relaxation flow through your body. Now close your mouth and breathe through your nose for the rest of this meditation. We will do a full body relaxation, bringing awareness to one area at a time. First, relax your forehead. Relax your eyebrows. Relax your lips. Relax all your facial muscles. Relax your scalp. Relax your brain. Relax your shoulders. Relax your arms. Relax your hands. And relax your fingertips. Relax your heart. Relax your stomach. Relax your hips. Relax your thighs. Relax your calves. Relax your feet. Relax your toes. Feel your body totally relax. Allow yourself to feel the stillness of this moment. There is absolutely nothing you need to do other than what you're already doing right now. Just relax, breathe, and listen to this audio. Remember this feeling of calm and centeredness. You can come back to this feeling any time simply by relaxing your mind and your body, and by choosing to live in the present moment. Right here, right now. You are safe. You're safe here. Too often, we allow our minds to dwell on the past or worry about the future, causing stress and anxiety. We can't change the past and we can't predict the future. All we have control over is now. So live in the now and do the best you can in the present moment. If you think about it, the past and the future are only a figment of your imagination.   They're illusions, perceptions held by your mind. The only thing that's real is the present moment right in front of you. The present moment is always your place of power. So take a deep breath with awareness of the present moment, right now. Feel the energy you have flowing through your body right now. You are alive, you are here, and you are safe. I'd like to share some positive affirmations with you.   Feel free to recite along with me in your mind. I am enough as I am. I am exactly where I'm meant to be. Energy goes where attention flows, and my attention is here and now. I use my power in the present moment. I am guided, protected, and loved. I trust in the guidance of the universe. I allow myself to let go, trust, and enjoy life. I feel lighter and freer.   I am safe. As you continue your meditation practice, visualize your ideal image of peace. What does peace look like to you? Focus on that image and visualize it in as much detail as possible, inviting sights and sounds, and even smells. Place yourself in the scene of peace. Visualize yourself as your brightest self, feeling light and carefree in this world of serenity. Begin to bring your awareness back to your breath. Take three deep breaths with an open mouth exhale. Bring your hands together and return to your thoughts of gratitude.   Thank yourself for nourishing yourself with this meditation session. Blink your eyes open and see the beautiful world around you. Observe your surroundings with a fresh perspective and continue your day with positivity and peace. Sending you love and light. Namaste.

0 welcome to the session where we'll be doing a self soothing practice to start settle into a physician of eve's with a straight back and wakeful posture you can imagine there is an invisible string attached to the top of your head holding you nice and tall allow your shoulders to fully rely you rest your arms where they're most comfortable close your eyes so move your breath and feel your body by that and then bring your attention to the state of your heart listening inward in a gentle compassionate way holding a space for what's here now tuned into the flow of your breath allow your mind to rest on the breath as it goes in and out of your body follow each breath attentively silently recognizing each in-breath and each other who now will relax our attention from the breath and open to a sense of self love and compassion and silently repeat the following word may I be happy may I be safe may my heart feel peace and again in your own mind repeat these phrases receiving each of them with a kind and open heart may I be happy may I be safe may my heart feel peace and one more time slowly savor each one may I be happy may I be safe may my heart feel peace you know gently returning to your bra rest in this loving comforting space you've created for yourself but your breath continuing to welcome and soothe you allow your inhales and exhales to soothe any anxiety worry weariness sadness what pain very simply very lovingly let the breath arrive on the inhale you gently flow away on the exhale now gently relax your attention while growing up many of us never had the proper tools or guidance to deal with difficult emotions we never learned to understand our sadness or anger we weren't taught how to calm our anxiety or soothe our frustration instead we learned to distract and avoid the tune out unpleasant feelings with numbing sometimes destructive behavior but no matter what happens we developed when younger in our adult lives mindfulness can help us cultivate the skills of self soothing their meditation we learn how to calm our emotions and settle our nervous system we develop self acceptance and compassion we learn to tenderly be with whatever arises rather than run from it these tools allow us to care for our own hurt so rather than seeking discomfort and distraction or destruction remember to reach for the tools of self soothing be loving and gentle with yourself and you'll be able to hold your own heart give yourself space to feel and time to breathe and become your own source of soothing comfort as Brian andreas said there are days I drop words of comfort on myself like falling leaves and remember that it is enough to be taken care of by myself and as we come to the end of the session in these last few breaths fill up your heart once again with loving kindness now let your awareness return to the room hearing sound whenever you're ready open your eyes [Music] you
0 - Hi everyone. Welcome to Yoga With Adriene. I'm Adriene and this is Benji and today we have a beautiful meditation for mental balance and grounding. So grab something to sit on if you like. Hop into something extra comfy and let's get started. (bright music) Alright, welcome my darling friends. We're going to begin, surprise, our practice today in a comfortable seat. So take your time. Just notice if you're kind of rushing right now here and let's start to slow it down as you come into a nice cross-legged seat. And I will encourage you, particularly if you're new to sitting (chuckles) in a meditation to lift your hips up either on a couch pillow or if you have a bolster, great. You can fold up some blankets or some towels are just fine too. And get to where your hips are a little bit higher than your knees so you can create these two slides of the thighs down. And as you start to get settled in here, just start to tap into that inner smile as much as you're willing. This is my power tool, my secret weapon that I often talk about so it's not so secret, but just as you settle in you can start to kind of feel the benefits of this time that you're taking for yourself by softening and, yeah, tapping into that inner smile. It can be like, "I'm doing this." Or, "Oh my god, I need this." Whatever it is just tap into a little joy that you're taking this short but valuable time for yourself. Benji's relaxed. If you're not relaxed, we'll get you there or we'll try. Hopefully by now you're in your seat. Getting settled in. And if you are working with your back right now, we'll say that, feel free to sit up against a wall or you can even do this in a chair. You just want to make sure that your spine is nice and long. And on that note, let's take a moment here to gently tuck the chin. And bring more awareness to the spine. So that could be sitting up tall. It could just be noticing your pattern. Again, just gently tucking the chin. Feeling that length as you do so through the back of the neck. And best you can bringing more awareness to your spine. And if you haven't already, allow your hands to soften, fingertips to soften just wherever feels good and then as I often invite you to do in practice same thing here. Just notice what feels good today. Whether you need a more grounding palm. Right? Energetically, I'm here. (exhales) "I'm doing this. I need to breathe. "I need this time for myself." Or maybe you're feeling pretty good and this is more preventative care today. So open those palms up baby. Allow yourself to be a little more vulnerable, open. So, both are vulnerable, but you get to decide. And really we're connecting the brain to the body here. So there's so much that goes into these little gestures and making decisions for yourself. If you know a mudra you want to take it now, please do. And then if you haven't already, close your eyes. Allow your eyelids to get heavy here. And if for whatever reason you're not comfortable with the eyelids closed, just soften your gaze gently down past your nose. (light music) Alrighty and we've begun. Chin slightly tucked. Neck long. Hands, arms, carefully placed. Fingers soft. Let's start by noticing any sounds around us. Wherever you may be today. Or maybe you're relishing, silence. As we start to settle in and ground down, allow any extra movement, patterns, just fidgeting, see if you can allow them to soften as you build a little structure for your mediation here. In time finding stillness with more ease and being kind if you're noticing a lot of fidgeting or patterns. No worries. That's why we're here. To observe. With kindness. To welcome balance and clarity to both the mental and emotional self. Now most of you have already likely begun to notice your breath but if not allow me to roll out the red carpet, to bring fresh picked flowers to your doorstep and welcome you to just notice with a loving kindness your natural breath. And as you begin to notice the rhythm of your natural breath today, see if you can take it one step further. Inviting the mind to also notice what the breath does to the body. As you breathe in and out. Notice, if you can, what parts of the body move as you breathe in. And see if you can notice how gravity tends to take over as you breathe out. So we have this sense of a rise and a fall, nice and easy, nothing forced. Just noticing what moves as you breathe in. And embracing the gravity as you breathe out. Now you can keep going just as is or I'll bring another fresh bouquet to your door and invite you to deepen the breath just a bit. Bringing more consciousness, more loving awareness to that inhale and watching the ripple effect as you breathe in. And using that exhale to ground down. Relax the shoulders. Relax your jaw. Allowing your inhale perhaps to be a little deeper, more full. And perhaps, when you're ready, allowing your exhale to be longer. Think of it as a beautiful extension. Breathing out as you ground down, down, down. Now go ahead and let your nice conscious deep breaths rest. Return to just a nice, easy, natural rhythm and flow. With so much love and a gentle, just gentleness, see if you can reestablish this awareness in your spine by maybe lifting your heart, gently sitting up a little bit taller. And you might feel, if you're doing this with your eyes closed, as though you grow a little bit longer and taller in the spine. And as you rest easy here in your seat, soften the skin of the forehead, relax the jaw and again use a gentle exhale to relax the shoulders down. You're more than halfway through your mediation. So as thoughts come to your mind, to your soul, just acknowledge them and come back to a loving awareness of your breath. So beginning to deepen the breath a little bit. Again here, see if you can find something new as you breathe in. Embracing gravity as you breathe out. And now one final invitation. As you continue to breathe and lean into the dance of feeling the inhale lift you, a rise. And feeling the exhale ground you, the fall of the breath. As you lean into that balance of the two, I lovingly invite you to just bring your mind's eye to the tip top crown of your head. Place your attention there. And then imagine, head over heart, heart over pelvis. Then from the crown tip top of your head in your own way, whatever this means to you, draw a line from the top of your head down through the center core channel of your being, all the way to the base of the spine. So we've placed a light rope or pipeline, a cylinder, whatever it is for you, this awareness from the crown of the head to the base of the spine. And see if you can allow that action, that awareness, to affect your breath or to at least notice if it changed the way your holding yourself up here with each inhale. And the way you're using your exhale to continuously ground down. And for the last minute here, we'll take that line from the crown to the base of the spine and just hang with me, my friends, continue that line down. Past your physical body, down into the earth. Continue that line down to the core of the earth. And then notice how that makes you feel. Notice if, and it may not, if that effects the way you carry yourself here, the way you breathe in and the way you breathe out. Now take three final conscious breaths. Finding balance and a sense of calm or peace between the dance of the rise and the fall. The lift and the ground. The earth and the sky. Then release your conscious breaths. Rest easy here as you slowly drop your chin to your chest. Try to keep the shoulders relaxed here as you gently open your eyes. Can flutter the eyelashes open. And when you're ready, gently lift your head. Cue the birds outside my window. We'll bring the palms together. Just take one quiet little beat here to notice how you feel. And we'll close it off by bowing together and whispering, Namaste.
0 Our own self-talk can contribute to the pain and low self-esteem that is sometimes associated with rejection or failure. This relaxation script will help you to identify the feelings and thoughts related to rejection and failure, and to change this negative thinking.  Get comfortable in a quiet place where you can relax.  Begin to relax your body by first tensing a muscle group, and then releasing to create a feeling of relaxation. Start with your arms. Close your hands into tight fists, and tense your hands and arms...all the way up to your shoulders. Hold this tension for a count of five: one...two...three...four...five. Now release, allowing your hands and arms to become limp.  Rest for a count of ten. One...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Now repeat, tensing the muscles of your hands and arms...holding very tight...very tense...one..two...three...four...five.  Relax, letting the muscles become relaxed and loose. Relax your arms even more deeply...allowing a feeling of heaviness to grow with each number...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Focus on your legs now, tensing these muscles from your hips...to your knees...to your feet. Hold the muscles of your legs very tightly...filled with tension...hold for a count of five. One...two...three...four...five.  Release this tension, allowing your legs to relax completely. Rest for a count of ten. One...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Repeat, tensing your legs again, holding very tightly...feeling the tension in each muscle...one...two...three...four...five.  Now relax, releasing the tension you have been holding in your legs. Relax completely, feeling your legs become heavier and more relaxed...relaxing even more with each number...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Tense the muscles of your back now...one...two...three...four...five...and release...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Tighten the muscles of your chest and stomach. Hold..one...two...three...four...five...and release...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Now practice holding and releasing tension with your breath. Breathe in deeply and hold that breath. Hold...feeling the tension...and then relax...breathe out...releasing all the tension with your breath. Take another breath, breathing in deeply...and hold. Now release, relaxing as you breathe out.  Allow your next breath to occur naturally...smoothly breathing in as much air as you need, and then releasing the air naturally, exhaling fully. Breathe slowly in and out...letting your breaths occur at whatever pace is comfortable for you. Feel your breathing slow naturally...becoming very calm.  (Pause)  Now that you are feeling more relaxed, think about the feelings of rejection or failure you would like to deal with.  Think about a time when you felt rejected or a time when you believe you failed in some way. When did this rejection or failure event occur? What happened? Imagine this rejection or failure event in detail, remembering as much as you can.  (Pause)  Now think about how you felt when the rejection or failure event was happening. What emotions did you experience at the time?  (Pause)  What about afterward? What emotions did you have after the rejection or failure occurred?  (Pause)  How are you feeling right now, as you think about the rejection or failure? Notice how you feel emotionally and physically in this moment.  (Pause)  Now examine the thoughts that go along with your emotions. Picture the event when you experienced rejection or failure. What kinds of things were you saying to yourself during and after?  For example, perhaps you were rejected by a friend who told you that he did not want to see you. You may have had thoughts such as:  He does not like me.  I am no good.  I am not fun to be around.  No one likes me.  I’m a loser.  These types of negative thoughts lead to the unpleasant feelings you experienced. If you want to feel better, you can change the negative thoughts to more realistic ones and your feelings will become more positive.  One way to change negative thinking is through affirmations to build confidence and increase self-esteem. Let’s work on increasing confidence now.  First, focus again on relaxing your body and calming your mind. Let all your previous thoughts go, and be only in the here and now.  (Pause)  Breathe away the thoughts, just allowing them to pass...letting each thought slip away...  You do not need to do anything in particular...just relax...and let your thoughts pass, without dwelling on any of them...  (Pause)  As you begin to relax, allow yourself to open up to the idea of feeling confident and secure...strong and positive...imagining what it would be like to experience positive feelings and believe positive things about yourself.   Imagine what it would be like to look at a situation with new eyes...with self-respect...  Imagine how you would handle rejection or failure as a self-respecting, confident person...treating yourself with respect and love...  Think about the idea of accepting imperfection...of allowing mistakes and learning from them...think about all the true, realistic things you could tell yourself if you experience rejection or failure.  Instead of saying, “he does not like me" or “no one likes me," you can tell yourself the following types of statements:  I cannot read people’s minds. The thing that happened does not necessarily mean that he does not like me. There are people who care about me. I care about me.  Instead of saying, “I am no good," you may say:  I made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. I do not like making mistakes, but I can learn from my errors. I choose to learn from this experience. I have many good qualities and I also have flaws.  Think about the more positive, more realistic, encouraging statements you could say to yourself about the situation where rejection or failure occurred.  (Pause)  It is normal to experience rejection sometimes. You are a human being and all human beings go through rejection.  Remind yourself that you are a good person.  It is okay to feel upset. Know that these feelings will pass. You will soon feel better.  Be kind to yourself. The most painful rejection is the act of treating yourself unkindly. Be a support to yourself.  (Pause)  You are a human being with both strengths and weaknesses. It is okay to have flaws. You, like all people, will make many mistakes in your life. Errors are part of being human.  We all fail from time to time. Failing at one thing does not make you a failure and it does not generalize to you as a person. A failure at one thing can be better described as a mistake, rather than a failure.  Failing at many things, that is, making many mistakes, is a healthy, normal process. Successful people fail many times. You are a successful person.  Mistakes can be turned into positives by growing from them.  (Pause)  Now you can simply relax...no need to focus on anything at all.  Just drift...relaxing...  (Pause)  Allow a feeling of confidence to begin inside...deep within your core...it may feel like warmth...such a solid, strong feeling...  Let this confidence grow...getting bigger...radiating from inside you...filling your entire body from head to feet...shining from you and lighting up the room you are in...  It feels so good to be filled with confidence.  Allow the confidence to grow...all on its own...it grows without you doing anything at all...getting bigger...even stronger...feel the confidence that fills you...  Any negativity in your life can be a trigger for this confidence to grow. Rejection or failure... upsetting events...anything negative in your life can remind you of this feeling of confidence you have right now.  When something negative happens, find that a feeling of confidence begins inside and grows...filling you with strength and poise to deal with the situation. You can feel good and feel confident even in circumstances that are less than ideal. Negative situations can be a cue for this confidence to grow.  Feel the confidence fully, right now...filling you with complete confidence and calm.  (Pause)  Keep a feeling of confidence with you as you complete this relaxation exercise. Take a few moments to re-awaken your mind and body.  Open your eyes and look around the room, becoming re-oriented to your surroundings. Stretch if you want to, and feel your body waking up.  When you are fully awake and alert, you can return to your usual activities, feeling confident and calm.
0 Take a moment to settle into a comfortable position.  Notice now, how you are feeling.... how you are doing right now in this moment.  How does your body feel? Scan your body for a moment now, starting at your feet, simply noticing how your body is feeling.  Notice your feet... ankles... legs.... hips. Continue scanning your body, moving upward to your stomach, back, chest, sides. Mentally scan your hands, arms, and shoulders... your neck, head, and face.  Where is your body the most tense? Where is your body the most relaxed?   Just notice the state of tension and relaxation in your body.  Notice how your body relaxes... bit by bit.... without any effort on your part. See how your muscles become a little bit looser... less tense.... naturally, just because you are taking a moment to sit quietly and relax. Without any effort or input from you... without you even trying... your body becoming slightly more relaxed with each passing moment.  Think about your body image... what is body image? Maybe you think about the picture in your mind you have of what your body looks like. Maybe it's the ideas you have about your body... your feelings about your physical self. Perhaps body image is is a vision of how you think your body should be. What does body image mean to you?  Take a moment now to consider your thoughts and ideas about your own body. How are you feeling right now, thinking about your body image? You might feel neutral, content, comfortable, uncomfortable, satisfied, dissatisfied, happy or unhappy, angry, afraid, accepting..... maybe a combination of things.... contradictory feelings are common.... and it is okay to feel however you are feeling.  What might it be like to accept your body, just as it is? What if you felt okay about your physical self? Imagine for a few moments what that would be like.  Think about a time in your life when you felt accepting of your physical self - your whole self, or even part of yourself.  Which parts of your body are the easiest for you to accept?  Imagine if you could accept your body as a whole, rather than as a collection of individual parts.  You have been doing some difficult thinking these last few moments. Let's take a step back now, mentally, to relax.  Breathe in, deeply. And breathe out.  In.... and out.....  In... and out.....  Keep breathing deeply, slowly. It feels good to take deep, calm breaths.  Just relax for a moment while you notice your breathing. Just notice your breaths for a moment.  (pause)  If there are any areas where you are feeling tense, direct your attention to these areas as you breathe.... imagining that each breath in brings relaxation... and each breath out expels tension. Breathing in relaxation... and breathing out tension..... each breath relaxes you further.   (pause)  Now I will say some body image affirmations. You can repeat these if you wish, or simply relax as I talk.  Each affirmation is true.... even if it may not seem true right now.  Let's begin the affirmations.  I am okay the way I am.  I can accept myself the way I am.  My body is acceptable just the way it is.  I am an okay person.  I accept this body I am in.  There is no need to be perfect.  My imperfections make me unique.  I am perfectly alright just the way I am.  My body is a functioning whole.  I am human, and all humans have flaws.  I can accept my imperfections.   I free myself from judging my body.  I am okay just the way I am.  I accept myself.  Now that you have repeated some affirmations, take note of how you are feeling. What was it like to repeat or listen to the affirmations?  It is okay to feel however you are feeling right now, good or bad. Accept the variety of feelings you may have.  Take a moment now to just relax. Let all the worries and tension go as you breathe slowly in... and out.... in.... out..... continue to breathe slowly, deeply.... naturally.  When you are ready to return to your waking level of consciousness, slowly leave this relaxed state you are in. Keep with you a feeling of calm, while becoming more awake and alert.  Wake up your body and your mind. Move your arms and legs a little and feel your muscles reawakening.  I'll count up now from 5 to 1, and when I reach 1 you will be fully awake and ready to return to your usual activities.  5  4  3  2  1

feeling in control I'd like you to participate in the following exercise with me think about how you feel when you're consumed with anxiety about your obsession take a moment and allow the feelings to rise knowing you are safe and protected I understand that you feel stressed and anxious right well that's okay that's right it's okay to feel anxious in fact it's quite normal anxiety is a normal sensation whenever we are stressed or concerned I would like you to remember that whenever you feel anxious again whenever you feel yourself dwelling on small details and becoming increasingly anxious you will tell yourself that it's okay to feel this way and it will soon pass [Music] that's right these feelings will soon pass now picture yourself tomorrow you become engaged in your usual pattern of obsessive thoughts and feeling anxious you begin to have recurrent persistent obsessive thoughts maybe you feel like you have touched something that's contaminated and you feel the urge to clean yourself several times or maybe you're unsure whether you locked your door or perhaps you feel the urge to obsessively count or arrange things in a certain way whatever it is that your thoughts are obsessing over you do not perform the ritual see yourself having obsessive thoughts but remaining in the same place and not doing the ritual for whatever reason [Music] if you become consumed by the thoughts of not locking your door or not turning off a light you check on it once at this point you tell yourself that the door is locked or the light is off you feel a sense of confidence rush over you you now have no doubts about the door or the light [Music] and later was the few minutes or hours later if you feel any doubt starting to creep back into your head you deal with the stress and anxiety by taking a deep breath feeling calmer on every exhale [Music] just practice now take a deep breath in seeing the tip of your nose as you inhale and fill your lungs noticing the calm returning to you now as you exhale deeply and slowly repeat another two times or until you know you will be calm [Music] you get through this hard time you do not perform the ritual you are choosing to remain calm instead of resisting the obsessive thoughts you can do it [Music] now imagine yourself two months from now you are still doing a good job observing and allowing your obsessive thoughts and compulsions to pass but you may still be having some anxiety in other areas if this is the case use the breathing technique once again and choose to allow the thoughts and compulsions to pass without taking any action or performing any rituals you will continue to work on allowing your anxious obsessive thoughts to pass through your mind and body please know that some thoughts take longer to pass than others be patient and allow the time needed until once again you feel calm [Music] you want to have complete control over these thoughts and you do you begin to realize that you have the power over your mind not the other way around you begin to feel more confident and sure of yourself as each day goes by you are so excited at the prospect of being free of obsessive thoughts you know that anxiety is a part of life and you will feel anxiety whenever you worry about the future and what's next but whenever the thoughts begin to be obsessive you take control and breathe deeply allowing the initial thoughts and worries to pass bringing yourself back to the present moment [Music] now picture yourself free of all obsessive thoughts and anxiety living an obsessive thoughts and anxiety free life you may tell yourself to be present tell yourself that you'll deal with it when the time comes tell yourself that you're responsible and always remember to turn things off when you're supposed to you are able to enjoy the world around you you are happy and full of energy you are in control of your thoughts and actions and you are free to take on the world whenever your thoughts do become obsessive and you feel you cannot let them pass just listen to this meditation allowing you to feel the immediate release trust me and trust your inner being that this is your new way of life [Music] to manage your patterns of thinking by seeking ways to be present and allow the morrow to take care of itself by listening to this meditation and allowing yourself to enjoy the freedom of overcoming anxiety and obsessive thinking you can finally experience freedom from any worry or concern and in this moment you embrace the opportunity to be free of all anxiety and in your own time once you're feeling ready you may take a deep breath and release yourself from this meditation by stretching perhaps your name and opening your eyes to return to your day namaste [Music]
0 hello welcome to today's gentle movement practice for relieving stress and anxiety i'm sarah raymond with the mindful movement so just a quick overview of what we're going to be doing today primarily it's going to be seated so you can be seated in a chair or on the floor even on a couch whatever is comfortable for you and then the second half will be a little bit on the floor so if you're comfortable coming down onto the floor with me you'll join me if not then you just participate in the front first half of the practice so we'll start with a little bit of breathing and then some gentle self-massage techniques to bring some awareness to different body parts when you might be feeling anxious and need a little bit of grounding and then some gentle stretches to open up the area that allows you to deepen your breath and find a little bit more ease if you are experiencing stress or anxiety so let's get right to it so come to any comfortable seated position and we'll start with a four seven eight breath so it's an inhale through your nose for four counts a hold for up to seven if you don't feel comfortable with seven then you can do a shorter hold and then it's a slow exhale through your nose for eight counts and i'll count you through the first two and then we'll practice a little bit on our own so again finding any comfortable seated posture tall lifted spine shoulders relaxed and down maybe close your eyes if you'd like and then exhale fully as a preparation breathe in two three four hold two three four five six seven breathe out two three four five six seven eight again breathe in two three four hold two three four five six seven breathe out two three four five 6 7 8 now continue on your own so finish one more cycle on your own and then allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm normal depth and flow and then next we'll take three deep inhales through the nose and this time as you exhale create an audible sigh so do that two more times let your body soften and relax with each exhale blink your eyes open if they were closed okay so next we're going to move on to as i said some self massage techniques i'll take my glasses off here so we'll start with the facial massage and you're just putting a gentle pressure doesn't have to be significant you can use your fingers or if you have a tiny little ball that might work too but you're basically finding the bones in your face and pressing on the bones and you might just press along the bones or you can press and gently pull either outward downward upward whatever feels like it's the most effective for you we're not going to spend a ton of time here you can again close your eyes if you like and go against your nose at the cheekbone above your eye eyebrow i should say above your eyebrow your forehead and then i like to spend a good bit of time right at around the jaw so it's pretty much in line with where your ear is so you can find them there's a bone on the top and a bone on the bottom and then there's a little indentation and you can press there and open and close your jaw and then go around the jaw and then you would just of course do the same on the other side and if there's any areas that feel particularly sore you might just stay there and take a few deep breaths and like we practiced earlier when your exhale is longer than your inhale it can have a little bit of a relaxing effect relaxing effect for you you'll start to find the areas that feel like you need to spend the most time there and you can always just explore there so again find the jaw hinge of the jaw open and close okay and if there's anywhere that you feel like you need to spend a little bit more time you can do that otherwise we'll move on to our neck so you can use both hands or one at a time your choice you'll feel just behind the ears the bone start there and then start to work your way down and you can even go to this upper trapezius area so the top of your neck and shoulders and then let me show you from the back you're going to take one hand on either side of your neck so on either side of your spine i should say and then think of pulling outward and as you do gently let your head drop back and then come back up again so you'll go through that a few times right starting right at the base of the skull and then working your way down and then after you do that a few times you can um i like actually do this with the opposite hand so the muscle right at the top of your shoulder you'll grab with your opposite hand squeeze up draw your shoulder up towards your ear and then just release down squeeze up and release down one more time on the side and then we can switch sides so as you squeeze that muscle lift your shoulder up and release and all the time continuing to breathe fluidly good okay and then last bit of self massage will be the area of your chest so if you can find your collarbone at the top of your chest you're going to go just below the collarbone and you'll just give a little bit of pressure you can push in and then pull down gently and as you pull down you might explore turning your head in the opposite direction so you feel a little bit of stretch through maybe the neck at least so my my left side is always a little bit tighter especially at the neck here so i know i need that and then you might go down a little bit below the collarbone if that feels okay for you and we'll do the other side so finding the collarbone right below press in and feel free to either tip your head towards the opposite shoulder or turn your head towards the opposite shoulder maybe again go down a little bit below the collarbone okay and that will be all of our self massage today so next we'll start to do some very gentle stretches so again you can remain in any comfortable seated position arms by your sides and then we'll stretch through our neck here so you can begin by tipping your right ear towards your right shoulder i'll mirror you here and as you're tipping your head to your right think about drawing your left shoulder down away from your ear and then you'll draw your chin towards your right collarbone and then you can either stay here with your chin towards your collarbone or go back to chin forward whatever feels comfortable and then take your left arm out just um above the height of your hip i would say turn your palm forward and then you're moving from your wrist so you'll draw your fingers backwards and forwards a few times be gentle here there's no need to be aggressive with these stretches and then just allow your arm to relax down draw your chin toward your chest slowly and then your head comes back up and we'll do the same on the other side so nice and gentle tip your left ear towards your left shoulder encouraging your right shoulder to stay down and then turn your chin you can see i'm moving very slowly to make sure i don't go too far too fast chin towards the left collarbone and then as we start to add the movement from the arm you can again either keep your chin down or tip it forward but you're still bringing your ear towards your shoulder and then we lift uh let's see this is your right arm out to the side just a little higher than your hip and then palm facing forward as you move from the wrist fingers go back and fingers forward and you might start to notice if you're tensing up through the neck this might be too high so bring your arm down or make the movement from your wrist a little smaller and then relax your hand down slowly draw your chin toward your chest and just letting your head hang here for a moment take a breath in and out and then slowly bringing your head back up all right and then from here a couple spine stretches so we'll lift your left arm drawing your shoulder down and think about lifting up tall and at the same time grounding down and then gently side bending over to your right and now we'll start to add some movement but i want you to try to focus on keeping your left sit bone heavy on the ground so as you turn your shoulders forward towards the floor you're not lifting that right uh the right side of your butt up and then come back to center and turn your chest towards the ceiling and center now we'll keep doing that movement you're going to bring your eyes to focus on your top hand and then we'll follow the hand so you're looking forward as your shoulders rotate forward looking back towards the ceiling and then behind you one more time rotating forward looking forward rotating back and come through center and back up again all right maybe roll your shoulders around a few times and we'll do the other side so lift your right arm again lift tall first and root down through the pelvis and then we side bend over so as i said my left side is always a little tighter so i have to remind myself to draw that shoulder down easy in the neck and then begin to rotate shoulders forward and back and now adding the eyes so looking up at your top hand rotating forward just keep that top hand as your focal point one more time forward and back and center and up again okay so um this next part if you are comfortable lying down on your back i would recommend doing that if you prefer to be seated you can definitely do this seated so i'm going to take it down onto the floor and once you lay down you're going to interlace your hands and place your hands right at the base of the head now again you could do the same exact thing as seated if you prefer now if you have any shoulder issues uh if just one shoulder is not comfortable in this position you can just do this with one hand or if neither of your shoulders are comfortable uh overhead you can use a pillow under your head is fine so we're finding this sense of almost traction so my hands are at the base of the skull where there's two little bony points and i'm gently lengthening those two bony points away from my shoulder so that my neck is nice and long and then i'll relax my arms by my side so my head's heavy neck is relaxed and then i'm actually gonna do this without my glasses with your eyes only look as far to your right as you can and you'll just allow your eyes to stay in that position so eyes are looking as far to the right as you can without moving your head and then come back to your breath and we'll stay here for a few breaths if you feel a sense of release or relaxation response like a sigh or a yawn you can bring your eyes back to center if you don't quite get there then you'll just stay for a few more breaths and then bring your eyes back to center if they're not already and just blink your eyes a couple times you may have to repossession reposition your head and neck and then we'll do the same thing to the left so you're keeping your head still and moving only your eyes looking as far to the left as possible and then once you do that you'll keep your eyes left back to your breath and then just allow your body to relax so maybe scanning through physical sensations of your body to see if there's anywhere you could soften you know i tend to grip through my hips a little bit so it's helpful to relax there [Music] or maybe you could find a little more ease in your shoulders take one more breath looking left come back to center again blink your eyes and then you can close your eyes and take your hands out from behind your head relax them by your sides and then if you are uh laying on your back just bring your knees in toward your chest you're still seated you might fold forward over your legs just in essence giving yourself a gentle hug and take a few breaths there checking in to see how you're feeling okay and then releasing your feet back down or coming back to seated and then we're going to move on to laying on our belly so you'll roll over if you're on the floor come down onto the floor if you were seated and then you're going to be propped up on your forearms so elbows under shoulders if you can if this feels like it's too much on your lower back then you can take your elbows wider and if that still feels like too much you might go still a little wider or other option would be to be all the way down okay so we do want to be working to open the chest as much as possible so again you can take nice deep breaths okay so if you're on your forearms you're pressing down into the forearm to lift the crown of your head as tall towards the ceiling as you can and then you might allow your butt muscles and your legs to relax and then start to breathe into your belly expanding side to side front to back and as you're breathing out do your best to avoid sinking down into the shoulders okay so you can stay here or we're going to add a side bend so leading with your eyes look left side bend left so that means your left shoulder will go towards your left hip and you're looking with your eyes to see how far behind you can see maybe you could see one foot maybe you can see both and then come back to center and then to the other side so eyes first then the shoulders and then the waist and center now coordinating that with your breath so you can really breathe in either either pattern but i like to inhale as i side bend and exhale back to center keep thinking about the crown of the head lifting away from the floor and then last little addition here if you're comfortable with it is to add a bend of the opposite knee so as you side bend the left you're bending your right knee and center and as you side bend right you're bending your left knee so remember eyes are leading the way we'll do one more in each direction and then come down stack one hand over the other and you can rest either your cheek or your forehead on your hand and then take a nice deep breath into your belly and let it out we'll do one more belly breath here i like to do the belly breath on the floor like this because you can feel your belly expand against the floor okay and if you're comfortable on your knees in a child's pose position you can go there so you can either have your knees apart and your big toes together with your knees together and your big toes together hips back and then chest comes down now if your knees and or hips are not happy here just roll onto your back and hug your knees into your chest a few breaths again soften and relax the body okay and then we're going to add a side bend here so taking your hands over to your left ribs over to your left and then settling into that child's pose position again you might encourage your right hip to draw back your right fingers to crawl forward and then now as you breathe send your breath into the right side of your body from the armpit down to the ribs down to the waist and then take your time coming over to the other side so again drawing now left hip back left fingers forward using your breath into the left side of your body to create expansion to increase mobility of the ribs and the muscles that assist in breathing and then come back to center and back up again okay so we are going to do one more stretch to continue to open up the rib cage area again the muscles in between the ribs help to breathe or allow for a deeper breath so you come on to your side with your knees bent so they're going to line up with your hips and then your bottom arm can go out in front and if your neck is okay with it your head can come down if you feel like you need a little bit of a support just grab a pillow or a blanket or a towel and roll it up and then we'll start to lift the top hand towards the ceiling so right up over your shoulder again use your eyes to facilitate this so you're looking at your hand just above your shoulders and then start to bring your top shoulder towards the floor and that will allow your arm to go back keep following your hand with your eyes as far as you can and then eventually maybe your arm reaches the ground and if it doesn't that's okay but if it feels like it's strain on the elbow you can bend your elbow and just rest your hand on your shoulder so more importantly is that we're twisting through the rib cage here and the chest stretch is sort of a bonus there if you do feel comfortable with your hand on the floor all right once we have arrived in our twist you're welcome to close your eyes and begin to breathe into the area that feels like it's stretching the most for you so perhaps it's the rib cage or maybe it's your hip or your inner thighs whatever you're feeling is fine just send your breath there and encourage relaxation to come to you and then take your time as you start to unwind yourself back and then we are going to turn over and do the other side so you make your way onto your second side again knees are bent out in line with your hips bottom arm out in front head comes down and then you'll lift your top arm up towards the ceiling find the hand as your focal point and then your shoulder is the first to move so as if you're trying to get that top shoulder to touch the floor behind you which first folks it won't quite get there and that's okay so once you twist as far as you can you can always bend the back elbow and put your hand on your chest if that feels more supportive or you can let your hand rest on the floor closing your eyes if you wish and taking a few deep breaths scanning through your body noticing where you feel any restriction or gripping and sending your breath there okay take your time as you untwist and then you can use your top hand to press you up to seated and then as you come to seed it again let's uh do a quick check-in so you'll close your eyes let your arms relax by your sides first notice your natural breath after spending some time in self-care you might notice your emotional state after this short practice to help reset your nervous system and decrease stress and anxiety you might check in with your physical state notice the muscles around your eyes your jaw your neck see if there's a little bit more softening available softening the outer layer connect with this calm peaceful feeling know that is always within you within reach when you're ready gently blinking your eyes open so any of that can be separated out and used on its own so the four seven eight breath pattern the self massage techniques or any of the stretches to be used to help calm you down bring you you know back into your body if you're feeling uh moments of stress or anxiety and additionally i'll share with you a playlist of all of our meditation practices for anxiety so that you can pull one up whenever you need it i hope you have a peaceful and calm day remember come back to this practice anytime you need it thanks for joining me
0 take a load off right now set yourself down and relax as best you can in this moment to fully appreciate what your mind is capable of changing [Music] through visualizing the sights sounds smells and feelings described you can alter how your mind perceives any anxious thoughts and sensations it may take some time and patience to see results but with perseverance in listening to this soothing meditation track on a regular basis your subconscious will realize that those situations that bring high energy and nervousness can be alleviated [Music] please make this time for yourself by setting aside an area where you can fully absorb this experience safely being comfortable and reassured that only good things will come take a moment to set the volume of this audio to a setting where you won't have to move and is not too loud to appreciate any lighting the need adjusting to create a calmer atmosphere and taking care of any otherwise distracting elements can be done there [Music] now is it time to be gentle with yourself you owe it to yourself your mind and body when tension builds and can be felt it can cause a chain reaction a snowball effect anxious feelings of a stirring and somersaulting stomach can lead to tension in the shoulders and other areas this then can lead to negative way of thinking and so the vicious cycle of these effects continue to drown out any positive vibes that you should be experiencing over time the confusion of what causes all these sensations and downward where your thinking gets a little fuzzy and trying to understand why you feel the way you do becomes lost [Music] as this meditation continues and you absorb yourself more you will begin to open up seeing understanding and realizing that perhaps you have become too hard on yourself [Music] there are a few possibilities of my anxiety sneaks up when you least expect it this can be from being too strong for too long guilt from the past or simply being in new circumstances there are many many more these are just examples you know help this quiet time to let thoughts feelings and sensations be shown in a safe and calm way where you are fully in control in a moment let the imaginative side of your mind take over as you begin to relax underneath your subconscious will be making notes readjusting things and compensating you with a more positive way of thinking gifting you with a karma mood whilst deeply relaxing your body [Music] now as she lays still and relaxed as best you can let your imagination begin to take over see in front of you a corridor and at the end of just a few steps forward is light take a break from your mind right now forwards and away from yourself into the light [Music] the dark corridor can be seen as the confusion that surrounds the mystery of your anxious feelings and where the light is projected from will perhaps provide you with answers to take back with you when you do return you can give yourself permission to bring back as much of this experience as you wish [Music] in the distance you see blues yellows and greens mixed in with a subtle warm overturn the shapes you see are moving slowly or very easy on your eyes as you get closer everything becomes clearer as you now see a beautiful fine sandy beach that soaks up the warm daytime Sun [Music] palm trees gently sway at the edge of this beach oasis whilst creating a soothing white noise has the leaves dancing the comforting breeze the sight of an aqua and blue ocean washes the smallest white waves as they spill onto the salt and sand which glistens like diamonds in the Sun the breeze is warm as it gently strokes the calm midday Sun onto your face and body relaxing you slightly [Music] as you walk from the shadows of the corridor onto this blissful Beach you fill your shoulders instantly relax and your face soften as if synchronizing with this calm atmosphere feeling the soothing effects of this oasis you turn and close the door to the corridor leaving guilt tension and worry behind [Music] the flourish of seagulls above you floating and gliding on past looking up you follow with your eyes as they slowly fade away mix in with the very blue sky above as if dissolving into the horizon [Music] the cells around you orchestrate calmness peace and tranquility the more you observe the more you may feel the warmth somewhere in your body possibly a real jewel chest area of relief and contentedness [Music] let your worries just dissolve now as you fully absorb yourself and become one with this atmosphere of bliss nothing matters and nobody needs your attention right now let yourself be free and present appreciating every positive aspect of peace that you are surrounded by [Music] as you walk toward the gentle rhythm of the spinning waves that stroke the sand your feet feel warm massaged with every step that you take [Music] noticing your feet and toes relax a little your breathing becomes easier and worried and tension is left behind [Music] [Music] you will now the person you know to be one that is calm filled with peace and content leaving all outside distractions you begin to uncover your true self your mind has been playing up to the situation's you have been around as if slipping in thoughts that are misplaced by sleight of hand now knowing that in some part that those feelings are but an illusion by changing your mindset and focusing on more positive ideas and images those thoughts and sensations just dispersed [Music] very much like doing something you know will take a lot of time energy and hard work you have to change the way your mind focuses [Music] in front you see a beautiful scene of sand sea and wolf filling your mind with such an image as a positive effect which transcends to your body in relaxation as you walk closer to the water's edge you feel the very relaxing fine sand under and around your feet with every step your mind drifts off more creating more clear thinking to focus on this presence travel moment [Music] as your feet pressed down on the sand weather calm waves cycle back and forth the warm water glides over your ankles instantly taking away any leftover attention in all areas of your body [Music] every muscle is now fully relaxed softer and resting gently as you are hypnotically massaged by every soft spill of warm white water [Music] looking outwards you notice the blue ocean glistening as a million ripples shimmer in the daytime Sun [Music] on the sand are a few pebbles within reach they are round and smooth laying under the water you pick up three of them and look help to see again you wonder how well these pebbles were skinned on the calm surface of the warm water [Music] as you slowly pull your arm back with the first pebble you place a thought that you would like to go with the stone [Music] when you already the pebble and thought go as one across the air [Music] smoothly skimming the top of the water eventually making a satisfying plunk as they drift to the ocean floor [Music] as the pebble and food disappear from sight you feel slightly more clear-minded relaxed and a piece [Music] with your mind now being more serene you begin to notice more around you where you have been standing soaking up the gentle white water wash you can see small golden fish have been swimming nearby in this clear blue sea crabs tickling the water with their pincers and a reflection of the water when your legs are another indication of how relaxed you are feeling right now [Music] when you think more clearly and more positively things around you can be seen more obviously it only takes a shift in focus and perception to realize this now these may only be small things to notice but they help to create a fuller picture outside in life this can also be practiced where there may be stressful or anxious situations a shift in focus can change how you feel and more importantly help you follow through of a more positive outcome the more this is practiced consciously the easier it will become and the stronger more calm you will be in these situations [Music] walking along the shore at the water's edge brings a sense of freedom as you look around at the beauty that surrounds you from the lull of each wave you step through the untouched blue sky to the endless horizon you see beyond you relax more becoming happier inside and more carefree [Music] having this time to let things settle down is an important step towards bringing peace to yourself wandering along the shore a sea plane slides along the horizon and training behind his aband which reads relax and let go [Music] the plane is a reminder of the busy thoughts that once occupied your mind as it slowly flies past at a distance being so far away you are safe remaining calm and balanced it fits quite nicely into this blissful setting with its hum whispering in the background gentle waves and brushing palm trees also have a calming effect you can incorporate this into the outside world by creating a balance that works for you where you remain fully in control [Music] it all begins with noticing your body as soon as you sense any tension or different thought pattern that brings about these feelings you can adjust how you react to them you are always in control [Music] filling yourself with positive feelings and even thinking about this tranquil place that you are in right now can help maintain and ease those worries away as time goes by this process will become quicker and easier also the more you notice these slight differences quicker you'll be able to adjust and regain a more comfortable state of mind [Music] sometimes it's not a question of how relaxed you are feeling but of how aware of your mind and body you are having this urge of knowing what is going on being present can help in situations with focus and balance is needed [Music] as you continue along the coast your feet are wash with the warm salty sea fill pleasantly relaxed with each unwed step your shoulders and top of your arms relax down as you stare out to sea noticing more along the way [Music] as the beach curves around much like a Cove you faintly see wisps of smoke from a small campfire burning in the distance with the Sun now setting with its orange glow you can hurriedly walk around the shore making your way over to the somewhat mysterious settlement [Music] the Sun sets over the ocean bringing with it the sky of reds purples and orange [Music] still very warm the colors bring a visual representation without feeling to your eyes [Music] the once shimmering service of the ocean was over white and blue as the Sun slowly sets downwards it has become a blanket of warm red and orange sparkles [Music] the sand that was once bright yellow is now of an orange rather looking like it is encrusted with diamonds as it shimmers below the setting sky the shadows of everything all now long bold as though leaning away from that orange horizon like the hands of a clock counting down the Sun [Music] the campfire is now in sight and the warm scent of wood burning can now be appreciated a weld the fire is furred water and a soft mattress bed underneath a large umbrella [Music] as you walk closer a sign that has been placed in the sand bears your name and below is a letter for you to read you reach down picking up the letter and see that this comfortable camp has been made up for you [Music] there is no name on the letter but all it says is that this is a thank you for taking the time to notice this beautiful place and being aware of your feelings [Music] feeling quite accomplished in your findings you humbly place the letter back and walk over to the food and water the Lok Fire gently bellows away generating enough heat to keep you born as you tuck into the food that has been left for you [Music] certain warm fine sound as you finish your meal you see the Sun has now set and the stars have been revealed in the night sky you could not imagine a more blissful place being more calm than what it has been but the night time brings a special quietness to everything the sky is now of a dark blue and black the ocean a cream and purple [Music] the breeze is no longer as the clear light sky extends its reach over the horizon the Stars now shine brightly and the moon is clear to see giving a subtle light to every edge [Music] as you look up you observe the craters on the moon surface on a bed of gentle ripples the sound from the shore your eye is now feeling heavy from relief and contentedness you take a few sandy steps to the thick soft mattress that lay upon the beach pulling back the blanket you clamber in and sink down deep into its hugging material your head slowly descends into the pillow as you feel all your energy let go [Music] looking into the very warm lock fire the flames magnetized your stare the boys you'd look through the flames the heavier your eyes become feeling reassured safe and at peace [Music] the blanket mattress and pillow softly beckon your muscles to relax with each deep and gentle breath that you take [Music] as you lay there quiet calm and relaxed your boys close one more time [Music] the sounds of the ocean the fire and your breathing hypnotically deep in your world and lead for sleep [Music] now knowing more than what you did before you came here brings relief that you can come back at any time taking with you all and everything you have seen heard and felt you now know you can use this experience to benefit you in the outside world [Music] with every deep breath and relaxed muscle comes a certainty but you are stronger than what you think you are you can harness the calm inside yourself at any time [Music] you will go through situations with a level head balance and remain fully in control at all times [Music] rest now relax more into this comfortable place let this calmness rest your mind and body to help you awake were first in a positive mood that will last longer will each and every day from now on [Music] let your mind know you are in control and that you are able to observe changes in how you feel whilst allowing for small adjustments when you notice small and subtle signs and symptoms [Music] from the time you awake you will have the ability to distance yourself from the way that you have been feeling recently close your eyes deeper now let your body just relax and let go [Music] nothing has changed in the time that you have laid here except your focus and perception of what goes on inside you are safe calm and relaxed [Music] slowly and surely drifting off into dreams as you relax and let go you enter sleep willingly and invite it with more acceptance [Music] drifting down deeper everything fading away as she no absorbed peaceful sleep with hugs and chose to let go [Music] [Music]

banister that runs down alongside the staircase as you look down the stairs you notice that there are ten steps leading down these are the steps that will lead you deeper into relaxation in a moment as I begin to count you will walk down these steps you will find that the deeper down you go the more comfortable and the more relaxed you will become so now you can hold on to the beautiful banister

may need to do so that you can focus on yourself 8 you allow your body and mind to completely relax and you allow the outside world to be tuned out 7 this step takes you even deeper into a relaxed

deep deep into relaxation and one all the way into your deepest state of relaxation where you arrive at the bottom of the staircase and now that you have reached the bottom of the beautiful staircase you are completely relaxed and comfortable take a moment to look at your surroundings in this dream state here you can see more clearly now that the light you see is shining out from behind a partially closed door at the bottom of the staircase this light is seeping out from the edges of the door expanding its light outward yet being partially blocked by the door you have a sense that behind this door lies all that you are capable of and all of your inner potential this light is shining out only a little bit allowing only some of your potential to be seen the door is essentially blocking the light of your potential to be fully seen you know that before this door can be opened all the way there are things that you must let go of there are blocks that must be removed recognizing that there are blocks that need to be let go of is the first step take a moment and first let go of any negativity you may be holding on to this negativity doesn't have to be named specifically just let it go let the energy of negativity go let the weight of limiting beliefs go see these beliefs floating away like a feather being blown by the wind only to be replaced with new positive beliefs these limitations we put on ourselves can be holding us back from moving forwards towards our ideal life and towards contentment let it all go let go of any expectations you have of yourself and let go of any expectations you believe others have for you let go of the need to please anyone but you and [Music] let go of the tendency to care what others think let go of attachments let it all go let go of competition with past versions of yourself and with others let go of the idea of being perfect and the need to always be right let go of the times when you find yourself thinking you should be saying or doing something in your life let it all go let go of excuses let go of judgmental thoughts let go of jealousy and thoughts of not enough let go of insecurities let it all go let go of the past in order to move forward let go of worries of the future let go of fear let go of grudges and forgive allow the past to be the past and not create your future path and let go of anything else that is no longer serving you be here now be present be mindful be grateful be full of joy and be loved once all of these ideas thoughts and blocks have been released begin to replace them with positive thoughts and energy you can now replace these thoughts with the simple and powerful idea that you are enough you are enough a deep inner confidence and sense of peace is had when you believe deep down that you are enough hear the words feel them in your heart let them sink into your subconscious beliefs you are enough you are enough you are enough being enough means being comfortable with your body just as it is today being enough is being comfortable with what you have achieved as well as what you have not yet accomplished being enough means self-acceptance and it is something we can all say to ourselves more often let this feeling of being enough settle into your belief system for a moment longer let it sink into your body like muscle memory what you put out into this world will come back to you put out positivity send out love and light radiate this positive energy outward to the world and it will come back to you give what you wish to receive and now that you have let go of all the negativity and replaced it with positive love and light now you know it is time to open the door at the bottom of the stairway all the way you know it is time to let the light your light shine out all the way so you can live your fullest potential with a deep inner confidence and knowing that you are enough you can see yourself reach forward to open the door as you

potential surrounding you filling you up this energy builds your confidence and motivation on the other side of the door you find a bench to sit down on here you can sit and contemplate your full potential and you take this new energy confidence and motivation and allow your mind to wander and be imaginative you allow yourself to be open to possibilities you are open to change and the opportunities that come with these changes you choose to soften into these possibilities lovingly although you have a strong idea of what you want and what is important to you you are willing to give a little and to be flexible you understand it takes time for changes to happen and take root you are patient and grateful for where you are on this journey you know you are exactly where you are supposed to be right now in life we often need to let go of what no longer serves us in order to make room for change in order to be open to the process of change wow this isn't always easy you are committed to doing what is right for your best interest and what is in alignment with your values rather than what's easy with change comes various emotions and you welcome them and you seek to feel them understand them and embrace these emotions without becoming attached to any outcomes you don't give up at times of unexpected challenge you persevere all of your thoughts are positive in your mind repeat after me I am open to change I am worthy of love and success I am confident I am diligent and moving towards my desired success I believe in myself and my abilities I am courageous and

0 Find a comfortable position sitting or lying down. Notice how you are feeling right now...physically and mentally.  Take a deep breath in through your nose, and release the breath through your mouth.  Take another breath, and allow your breathing to relax you as you exhale fully.  Breathe in gently... and as you breathe out, let the air carry the tension out of your body.  Continue to breathe slowly and gently as you begin to focus on relaxing your body.  Notice where your body is tense. Focus your attention on one of these areas. As you breathe, picture that part of your body becoming slightly more relaxed than it was before. With each breath, that part of your body becomes a little more relaxed.  Imagine what the relaxation feels like... tingly... soft... gentle... calm... loose... free... and let that feeling of relaxation grow.  Scan your body for any areas of tension, and for each area, let the relaxation soften the muscles as they give up their hold. Let the feeling of relaxation grow...spreading calm throughout your body.  Breathe in relaxation... and breathe out tension...breathe in calm...and let all the tension go as you exhale...  Continue to breathe slowly, and gently, deepening your state of relaxation more and more with each breath. Deeper and deeper. More and more relaxed. Calm. At peace.  Now begin to create a picture in your mind. Imagine a place where you feel completely at ease. This might be a favorite place you have been, or somewhere you have seen, or it might be completely imaginary. It's up to you. Picture this place where you feel happy and calm.  Create the details about this place in your mind. Visualize the sights... sounds... and smells... of your place. Imagine how you feel physically. You are comfortable, enjoying the pleasant temperature... enjoying being still and relaxing or doing whatever enjoyable activities you participate in here...  Enjoy the way you feel in this safe place.  You feel calm and safe here. At peace with yourself.  Remain in your peaceful place while you meditate calmly and build your self-esteem.  Imagine that all of the following affirmations are true for you, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation you experience. Repeat each affirmation in your mind, or out loud, with conviction. Use your imagination to fully believe each self-esteem relaxation affirmation.    The self-esteem relaxation affirmations begin now.  I am at peace with myself.  I appreciate who I am.  I value myself as a person.  All people have value, and I am a valuable human being.  I deserve to relax  I deserve to be happy.  I embrace my happy feelings, and enjoy being content.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  When my mood is low, I accept my emotions and recognize that the low mood will pass, and I will be happy again. I look forward to the good times.  My future is bright and positive.  I look forward to the future, and I enjoy the present.  I look fondly upon many memories from my past.  I forgive myself for my mistakes. All people make mistakes. I used to feel regret about some of my mistakes because I am a good person and want to do the best that I can, and now, I am still a good person and I release the feelings of regret because I have learned and moved on. I forgive myself for errors I have made, because I have felt bad about them long enough. I have suffered enough, and now it is time to be free. By freeing myself from past mistakes, I can move on and do good things. I forgive myself.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  I feel good about who I am today.

I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  I approach challenges with strength.  I do the best that I can at the time. I give 100% effort when I am able and when I choose to put full effort toward the things that are important. I accept my imperfections and the imperfections in what I do. My efforts are good enough, and they're okay.  I do not have to be perfect to be okay as a person.  I am a human being with flaws. I enjoy being who I am, and love myself as I am.  I nurture the child within me.  I feel secure in who I am, and do not need to compare myself to others.  All of the strengths I have ever had are present in me today. I still have the same positive character, even if not all of my strengths are shown right now. I have all of those strengths of character, and will use those strengths again.  I imagine and believe that all of these affirmations are true for me, right now in this moment, and enjoy the self-esteem relaxation I am experiencing.  I accept myself.  I care for myself.  I take time for myself, and enjoy it. I deserve time for myself, and I feel good about taking this time regularly.  I handle difficulties with grace.  I allow myself to experience and express emotions, both negative and positive.  I accept myself.  I am perfectly alright just the way I am.  I accept myself.  I am a valuable human being.  I accept myself.  I feel confident.  I accept myself.  I feel secure.  I accept myself.  I accept myself.   Think again about your peaceful place. Picture yourself enjoying this environment. Acknowledge the feelings you are experiencing after repeating the self-esteem relaxation affirmations. Accept any positive or negative feelings you are having. Allow yourself to feel calm and at peace. Now it is time to leave your special place. Know that you can return here in your imagination any time to relax, feel calm and relaxed, and feel comfortable and safe. Take with you the feelings of acceptance of yourself, and belief in the self-esteem relaxation affirmations. Continue to feel positive and accepting of yourself. Hold onto this secure feeling of self-esteem as you return to your day.  In a moment I will count to 3. If you choose to sleep, you can drift into a relaxing and pleasant sleep on the count of 3. If you wish to become fully awake, you can increase your alertness and become energized and fully alert on the count of 3.  One... take a deep, cleansing breath in... and exhale slowly.  Two... take another deep breath... and exhale...  Three... you are feeling calm, confident, and refreshed.

0 hello and welcome thank you for taking the time to listen to this meditation to help you find inner peace it will help you to calm the feelings of being overwhelmed that may cause you to get anxious or stuck in life we are a culture of information overload and live in a busy over scheduled world where we often think we need to do it all and do it perfectly this mindset of being attached to the perfect outcomes can be at the root of overwhelm or anxiety and can cause you to get stuck in your thoughts or actions today we will begin the process of self inquiry to get curious about what we are really feeling be okay with life as it is and then nurture and open our hearts with kindness this process will help you to find peace from within let's begin make yourself comfortable with your arms and legs uncrossed make sure to turn off all possible distractions and set this time aside for you in a moment I will guide you through a body scan to begin the process of relaxation so you can release tension and negativity by letting go completely you can turn your attention inward and now allow your eyes to close gently and bring your focus to your breath [Music] without changing your breath simply notice how it flows in through your nose feel the cool air as it passes into your nostrils and fills you up encourage each natural out-breath to release any tension that you may be feeling continue to observe your breath and allow it to deepen naturally and slow down today you will practice connecting to what is true for you in your heart you will cultivate loving energy for yourself to nurture what is true for you and to find peace give yourself permission to be fully supported by the earth to connect to the collective energy of the universe and to be open to possibilities of what comes with the state of comfort and relaxation and now slowly begin to scan your body as I say each part of your body encouraged a release a complete relaxation to find ease in your body allow the surface below you to support you fully [Music] begin this body scan at your feet and simply relax move your attention up from your feet and begin to release your lower legs and knees feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and connected to the energy around you as you allow it to let go and now find a sense of ease and your thighs and hips as you let go completely moving up take a deep breath to help release any tightness in your lower back continue this process of increasing your comfort and connection to the collective energy of the universe around you and welcome a feeling of softening into your abdomen let your chest and arms rest heavy on the surface below you feel as your neck and throat release any physical and emotional tension that you may be holding on to [Music] allow your jaw to unclench and feel as the small muscles of your cheeks I then forehead soften and smooth and as the small muscles in your face and jaw let go the rest of your body follows and softens as well now your whole body is heavy on the earth [Music] and allowing your breath to return to its natural rhythm and flow you find that you are fully relaxed you know you are safe and supported and you are open to guiding yourself into a calm state of mind now that you are fully relaxed you can begin this inquiry process by checking in with what is true for you what you are actually feeling without judgment and without trying to change anything [Music] make space for the truth to surface and whatever form it comes simply allow it to surface [Music] consider the situation or feeling that has you overwhelmed or stuck recognize what you are feeling and accepted in the present moment know that the state of overwhelm is simply an obstacle on your path and it is part of your journey [Music] because this may be a negative or challenging emotion let down your guard and your armor to this emotion make space for awareness and acceptance without judgement we often have the unconscious impulse to push away suppress or ignore difficult emotions which simply brings about more suffering some might busy themselves to prove their worth or neglect what is really going on some may have a fear of failure and the overwhelm may paralyze them some may feel anxious or restless based on all that there is to do whatever you are feeling is okay these are simply patterns that have developed they are not you recognize the self-talk going on in your mind recognize the potential that you may have unmet or unrecognized expectations from yourself or others that may be playing a role in the judgments of yourself [Music] or possibly you're experiencing negative self-talk [Music] begin to move out of the thinking patterns and bring your attention to your felt experience no need to attach words or labels to your feelings simply explore what those feelings are [Music] pause and allow these feelings sometimes we may be judgmental when a negative feeling surfaces acknowledged the feeling and allow it to be what it is without judgment [Music] or sometimes we may push the feeling down and focus on something else [Music] in this situation being present is the way stay in the moment stay with the feeling and be okay with it continue to make space in your heart for these feelings to come up and simply be [Music] we may want to resist the discomfort of a negative feeling and remove ourselves from the present moment do your best to stay present and mindful in a time when difficult emotions come up practicing a moment of pause after recognizing a feeling or behavior gives you the opportunity to make another choice a different choice than you are used to making creating space during this moment of pause allows you to stop the negative habit or behavior before it continues it allows you to respond skillfully rather than reacting by simply allowing the difficult emotion to be what it is you are able to bring your awareness to the present moment experience and you may notice almost immediately a sense of softening and ease around the emotion simply by allowing it to be with honesty and acceptance comes the ability to move forward and to grow once you have recognized the emotion and allowed it to be what it is get curious about what you are feeling and what is behind the feeling explore your own truth breathe deeply to allow space for your truth to surface [Music] now is the time for some deep self inquiry start to ask yourself some questions about what you are experiencing what is underneath the feelings you are experiencing is there a physical component to how you are feeling the answers may not come immediately and that is okay continue to allow the emotions to surface in these next few moments of quiet make space for the truth and acceptance of what is the answers will come in time [Music] [Music] begin to let go of judgments let go of self-limiting beliefs let go of expectations let go of fear let go of any negativity you may be holding on to this negativity doesn't have to be named specifically just let it go let the energy of negativity go let go of any past negativities and replace them with positive thoughts and gratitude take a moment to release all that is holding you back all that you have pushed down any anger and resentment any fears and any negativity [Music] as you bring the feelings and emotions to the surface do so with a sense of unconditional love for yourself see what is really going on for you and proceed with care and compassion continue to come back to the felt experience and move out of the thinking patterns and then take some time to nurture yourself place your hand on your heart if you like and offer love and kindness to yourself open your heart and let it in offer positive energy to the area of your heart [Music] ask yourself what it is you need in this moment to care for yourself to nurture and support you ask this of yourself often and listen really listen to what it is that you need to calm the sense of overwhelm to get unstuck to find peace within and now bring your attention back to your physical body and deepen your breath once more you are now beginning your journey back to the present moment and as you do you will continue to nurture yourself with care and compassion you will find inner peace begin to reactivate each part of your body from its relaxed State feel the rush of energy back into your body like a warm wave coming over you awakening your body slowly and when you are ready open your eyes you are fully back in this present moment feeling awake and energized
0 Welcome to this simple meditation to relieve stress.  Get into a nice position where you can be upright, elongating the spine.  It is best to be seated in the traditional meditation position with legs crossed, but if you need to have your back supported, you may sit in a chair.  Gaze around with your eyes, taking note of your surroundings.  See the colors clearly.  Notice things that are completely still around you, like the ground, furniture, and structures.  Can you become aware of anything around you that has movement?  Look around without putting labels on the things you see, just observe their colors, textures and patterns.  Notice how far away things are from you, or how close they are.  See how the light lays upon things, illuminating them.  Allow your mind to naturally find a spot in front of you to fixate on.  Begin to slowly blink your eyes, and do not look away.  Feel the relaxation within the darkness each time you blink.  Repeat think until your eyes want to naturally close.  When you close your eyes, notice a gentle wave of relaxation sweep over your entire body.  Bring your awareness to your breath, what is it like?  Did you take a nice inhale as soon as you focused on your breathing?  Pay close attention to how your lungs expand and contract with your breath.  It is a very natural and gentle sensation.  Noticing how your belly also expands and contracts easily as you breathe.  Allow the breath to relax you.  In and out…..  Expand and contract….  Refresh and relax…..  Inhale and exhale…..

0 thank you for taking the time to listen to this guided meditation to help reduce stress and anxiety this practice of relaxation is most beneficial when done regularly where the benefits are compounding and over time it will become easier for you while this practice of meditation will take many different forms and look different from person to person don't expect perfection be patient with your practice and the resulting effects if you find value from this and believe you know someone else that can benefit from listening please share with your friends and family the idea of being in the present moment is a powerful one when it comes to anxiety and stress we are often scheduled to the max and we become physically and emotionally stressed out we often find our mind cluttered and overthinking we worry about how the past could have gone differently where we wonder if the future will go as exactly as we plan it this meditation will help to calm down your overthinking mind it will help you to be present so that you can simplify and clear the clutter of your mind it has been said by many great thought leaders in this world but the way we do anything is the way we do everything so if we want to declutter our mind we must also declutter our physical world this mindfulness meditation can be used to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past and anxieties about the future more you practice this the easier it will become for you and you will see the benefits trickle over into many other areas of your life and now turn off all distractions and commit this time for yourself let go of your to-do lists and your responsibilities take this time for you for self-care of the gift to enjoy you must first help yourself and love yourself before you can help or love anyone else and when you are ready close your eyes and bring your full awareness to your breath begin to count your breath in then as you breathe out encourage the exhale to be one count longer than the inhale allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress and tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow and your body will calm down do this for a few breaths cycles then allow the breath to return to its natural rhythm know that your breath is an anchor to the present moment you know that you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment so you know you are always in the present moment when you are attentive to your breath as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer notice your thoughts and acknowledge them by saying in your mind thinking then come back to the breath and use this breath as an anchor to keep coming back to whenever your mind wanders this breath anchor is a grounding and stress relieving practice to continue outside of the session whenever you may experience a stressful situation at any point in life you can always just come back to your breath as if you are starting over this anchor will allow you to relax and times of stress as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and to slow down allow your body to soften and your breath to be gone know that your body responds to your thoughts so think about relaxing and ask your body for a release of tension your mind is so powerful in creating change in all aspects of your life and now as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up as you breathe out that white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of anxiety take a long slow deep breath in through your nose and now move the breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to just surrender as you exhale breathing out anything that no longer serves you each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even more deeply and now invite your body to relax each muscle completely begin with the muscles around the eyes and the jaw by relaxing these muscles specifically the rest of the body knows exactly what to do and will relax in response continue to unclench the jaw completely and soften the muscles around the eyes to begin to feel that familiar heaviness throughout the entire body all you have to do is think about relaxing and releasing the tension in your body and your body will respond because it listens to what your mind tells it and now feel the entire body let go feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside stay with your breath when you find your mind wandering stay with the physical sensations of your body so that your mind can continue to clear the clutter of the overthinking tendency know that your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you you are in complete control but for now your mind and body know it is time to relax and let go time to slow down right now all sounds around you are unimportant and they just add to your relaxation all responsibilities and items on your to-do list are unimportant right now all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow your body to relax and your subconscious mind will do the job of clearing the clutter notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper you now allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go letting your body mind and spirit become one and now begin to use your imagination and take a moment to see yourself in front of a beautifully decorated glass elevator door this class door is etched and frosted with the most amazing design on it see this design in your mind reach out and feel the texture with your fingertips feel the cool temperature of the glass this elevator will take you down to the deepest part of your subconscious mind so that you can declutter your thoughts release tension and negativity you see the door slowly opening and you step into the spacious elevator you know you are completely safe and you can see through the glass walls of the elevator you push the B button so that you can go down to the basement of your mind this elevator will lead you deep into relaxation each level will take you deeper down and in a moment as I begin to count the elevator will take you down slowly into a more deep relaxation you will find that a deeper down you go the more comfortable and the more relaxed you'll become 10 as the elevator begins at slow descent you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do eight you know you are right where you need to be on your journey and you allow the outside world to just to turn off seven each level down takes you even deeper into a relaxed state six you're committed to taking your life and dreams to the next level five letting go completely for going deeper and deeper into comfort the REE almost to the basement of your subconscious mind - deep deep relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and peace and now we have reached the bottom the elevator doors slowly open and you walk out into the basement of your subconscious mind you take a look around and see that you have stepped out into what looks like a library that stores all of your memories as well as the possibilities for your future there are rows and rows of shelves throughout the entire room each shelf filled with many many books you see books of all different sizes and colors some of the books are disorganized and there are areas of clutter around the floor in front of some of the shelves you feel an intense desire to organize the books so that they are easily accessed when needed and to clean up the clutter around the room knowing that by doing this you will organize and declutter your mind and your life you realize that just by thinking about organizing and cleaning magically this room changes the room becomes well-organized and the clutter is cleared this change has simplified your life and with this change you feel a positive change within yourself you know that deep inside you a switch has been reset so that everything works in your favor you are now organized and decluttered in all areas of your life as well as your thinking mind you are able to generate support and inspiration for yourself far more easily than before you enrich yourself mentally emotionally and spiritually to do all that it takes to actualize your goals thrive and live in alignment with your values and intentions you begin to take even better care of yourself you redefine yourself as a happier energetic and more lighthearted person you feel the physical weight of anxiety has been lifted to allow you to be a lighter and calmer you allow new and more empowered thoughts and inspired feelings of success healing wellness and happiness to profoundly build within you you respect yourself showing yourself loving kindness and compassion and now you let go of any negative thoughts that no longer serve you you let go of any pasts negativities and you replace them with positive behaviors positive thoughts and feelings of gratitude you are aware of your thoughts and you have the ability to change from a negative thought to a positive one just by being aware you believe that you could be strong and confident in your life you see your past limiting beliefs and behaviors disappear self-doubt fear and anxiety are things of the past and you replace them with optimism confidence and an easily calm disposition you trust your instincts and your abilities you are easily able to accept things as they are knowing that you are exactly where you are supposed to be on your journey and now bringing your attention to the room around you take one last look around at the organized and decluttered space of your subconscious mind know that this new organized space will translate to stress free anxiety free living in all aspects of your life now as you begin to walk back towards the elevator the doors slowly open and invite you in as you step into the elevator you have a strong sense that you can continue to reduce stress and anxiety in your life by continuing the process of simplifying and clearing the clutter oh you are capable of achieving your dreams and you have the potential to accomplish great things now bring your attention back to your physical body and your breath you will easily and effortlessly be able to use the breath as an anchor when you come out of the state of relaxation and now

0 you gonna sit with me girl am i live all right welcome welcome everyone thanks for joining me uh if you're new here i'm sarah raymond with the mindful movement i'm really honored to have you here and if you are joining me again welcome back uh if you if you have been here you might notice that this is not my typical space i am outside it is cold in maryland so i have my my lovely scarf that my daughter knitted for me sorry crocheted excuse me she will get mad that i said that and uh we got a fire and here i am i'm glad to be here and i just want to take a minute to talk a little bit about control so we don't really have control right like i don't have control over the wind tonight i don't have control over the smoke that might blow into my face or the dog's making noise or all of the things so we do have choice so i decided i wanted to go live tonight i made the choice that i was okay with not having control over the lighting and the space and the temperature and all the things and i made the choice to respond in a way that i could still feel safe and i could be okay with my choice and that's the lesson or the the teaching i'd love to embody or impart in today's practice so if you do hear the wind blowing then i invite you to sit with it recognize how your body instinctively responds you might even acknowledge that response and see if you can still work to calm your body calm your responses as we go through the practice so that's my my intention my invitation for you and if you have any other intention for today's practice then please honor that and that being said today's practice will be very gentle not a lot of movement per se but self massage and various exercises to help you regulate your nervous system or calm the nervous system and we're not going to get into a lot of the science or the what's happening just to feel into the experience but i did leave a link in the description box below the video to two different books that are great resources so if you do want to learn a little bit more check those out all right so let's jump right in so make yourself comfortable i'm sitting down obviously you're welcome to sit in a chair if that's more comfortable for you i would suggest being upright for at least the first portion of it as we get into the meditation then you can lie down and i should mention that les is here with us behind the camera and he will be in the chat so if you have any questions comments please feel free to leave them i'm just getting uh getting a signal we all good less we're all good someone's saying please rotate if possible rotate and here is the we don't have control over everything i think we just have to go with it and we're going to do the best we can tonight am i vertical i think they can rotate it from their device mine looks normal okay less is saying we just gotta go with the flow you can rotate it from their device he is saying you can rotate from your device i hope that helps rotate on your device okay thank you uh we're gonna we're gonna go with the flow tonight and i apologize if there's any glitches or tech technical issues but i hope that you enjoy the practice okay so let's start with a belly breath as a way to just check in so i like to have hands on my belly so i can get a feel for the movement there nothing forced nothing too strenuous just checking in so if you feel like you want to close your eyes you are welcome to do so and then begin to breathe in through your nose sending your breath down into your belly and as you breathe out you might like to breathe out through your mouth like a sigh so you're making a sound if that doesn't feel comfortable any other breath pattern is fine so taking a moment to check in and what i mean by that is notice the state of your body the state of your mind and you might even notice the state of your nervous system no judgment no need to change at this point just noticing you might think of taking like a snapshot in your memory of how you're feeling in this moment and then once you have that baseline let's blink our eyes open again if they were closed and then we're going to go into a little bit of self massage and everything that i offer is just that it's an offering take it if you like it but listen to your body and if it's saying no this isn't so so right for me right now just explore see what your body needs today all right so we're going to start with a a jaw massage so you can find the indentation at the jaw so it's about in line with the earlobe and pardon my dogs you're gonna press your fingers into your jaw fairly firmly going inward listen to your body and you decide how much pressure is right for you and then you can explore maybe circles feel great maybe just holding the pressure feels good perhaps you want to go up and down side to side you can open and close your jaw you might take a nice deep breath in and let it out like a sigh relaxing the lower portion of your jaw all right so if that feels great and you want to keep going keep going otherwise i'll move on to just um to the side of your nose so you think of the the lines that are the crease of our between our nose and our mouth you're gonna go about the top of that crease and you'll press in towards your nose a bit and then once you have that pressure gently pull out so it's almost like you're opening your sinuses and then just like we did with the jaw maybe circles feel great or maybe up and down i know it looks a little silly but we can all be silly together or maybe just hold the pressure and here's a nice place to gently pull out on the skin out on the muscles and take a deep breath in you might even feel you get more air in and let it go again stay there a little longer if you'd like otherwise we're going to go to the corner inside corner of your eyebrows so press pressing in gently you might just let your head rest in your hands and then same options go here you can move around in a circle it'll be a pretty small circle or just up and down and side to side and then again feel free to stay a little longer and then lastly we're going to go to the ears so i'll give you lots of options and you can choose what feels really good leave what doesn't and we'll start inside of the ear so not in the hole of your ear but in the on the cartilage and you're just going to kind of follow the line follow the different parts of your ears around kind of like what you might use a q-tip for although you're not going to go inside the ear canal and then i don't know if you can see this but you're going to grab the earlobes and just gently you can pull out you can pull forward and then work your way up the side of the ear and this area for me always feels really nourishing really relaxing my dogs are going a little crazy running around okay and then just relax your arms by your sides if you want to close your eyes again you can and let's take one more check in so all we've really done is a little bit of self-massage so just notice how that is serving you and just keep in mind everyone's different your body is different your nervous system is different your personal history is different from mine and anyone else that's watching so your experience in this practice will also be different so just take what you like and leave the rest okay so a little bit more nervous system resetting and then we'll move into our meditation so you'll keep your your eye gaze looking forward and then i'll mirror you you can tip your left shoulder excuse me left ear towards your left shoulder without lifting your your shoulder to meet your ear so keep drawing the shoulder down there we go and then with your head still take your eyes as far to your right as you can so it's almost like you're trying to see your right ear with your head tipped to your left keep your eyes fixed right deep breath in through your nose let it out with a sigh again feel free to come out of this sooner if you feel any need to do so one more deep breath in through your nose out like a thigh take your time bring your head back to center eyes back to looking straight ahead blink a couple times and then we'll repeat in the other direction so your right ear towards your right shoulder and then eyes looking as far to your left as you can breathing in and out three breaths if you can come out of it sooner if you need to ah and then the head comes back up eyes look forward blink a few times and then we'll do a variation of that with a side bend so i'm going to offer the side bend if it's too much don't worry about adding it so we'll go back to left ear towards the left shoulder and then you might allow for a little bit more of a side bend so meaning you're you're taking your spine over to your left and if you still want a little bit more your left hand can gently uh gently gently tug on your head and then we'll take eyes now to the left ear so you're looking towards the arm that's up my glasses always seem to be in the way for this one all right so about three breaths there and as you breathe out through your mouth think of relaxing your jaw may even wiggle it side to side and then take your time coming back through center and then other side so we go right here towards the right shoulder feel free to add a little side bend to your right and then option to take your right hand gently very very gently we're not tugging too hard here and then eyes are going to your towards your right ear so it's kind of on a downward diagonal about three breaths uh and then bring your head and eyes back to center okay so i feel a lot more calm than i did when we started so i hope that you do as well although it's not a requirement obviously if that's not how you feel that's your experience but i would love to guide you now into a meditation so if you prefer to lie down you are welcome to do so make yourself comfortable and if you prefer to sit up that's fine too so i like to think of posture as something that we don't have to really think about so get yourself into a position that doesn't take a lot of effort but allows you to be in a a straight spine position and then if you'd like you are welcome to close your eyes you don't have to we want you to feel safe so if you choose not to close your eyes maybe just soften your gaze downward and then just as we started take a moment to simply notice without judgment without the need to change you might notice the state of your physical body state of your your mind your thoughts you might become aware of sounds in your environment sounds coming through the video from my environment and the practice that we just finished we just went through is about inner resourcing about using your own ability to come into a calm state and so when there is a noise when there is a distraction because there will always be distractions the practice is about coming back to yourself coming home to yourself so with that in mind let's begin to move into a box breathing pattern so we are taking a little intention into our breath so we're breathing in for a count holding for the same count breathing out for the same count and holding once more so you might choose to start with a count of three or four and just see how that feels in your body so in your own time breathing in holding breathing out holding continue on your own for a few breaths if you want to increase the length the count of your breath that's fine if you find you get distracted or lose your count simply start over finish the breath cycle that you are on and just allow your breath to be natural and see what you notice are there sensations showing up in your body you might even ask yourself is there a message here as you notice my dog's barking notice your response can you lovingly start over can you lovingly bring yourself home to your experience so in this hopefully calm and reflective state you can ask yourself what is it that i need and just listen no thinking no trying just allow the answer to surface what is it that i need you might notice how your body your mind your nervous system are all responding to this question when was the last time someone asked you that and how does it feel to be able to ask yourself to connect with your inner resources so take another moment to just notice what's there for you and very gradually begin to let your awareness brought in you might start by noticing the support beneath you noticing the air touching any exposed skin [Music] or perhaps you are able to sense the energy around you and before you open your eyes if they're still closed see if you can sense both your inner experience and your outer environment the same time and as best you can keep that awareness of both your inner and outer experience as you blink your eyes open if they were closed coming back to full awareness you might rub your hands together just create a little warmth i know it's a little cold out here for me and then taking the warmth of your hands place the heel of your hands over your eyes very gentle pressure and then you might lean your head the weight of your head down into your hands and just rest there for a moment and you can let go of what you do not need and then gradually releasing your hands lifting your head and i would just love to thank you so much for joining me today in this not-so-typical recording environment i hope that you got what you needed from this experience and i would love to offer you if you are interested in more practices to build a foundation of meditation to check out our free seven-day course the

0 Begin to relax, finding a comfortable position and starting to let the tension leave your body.  Imagine that you are at the top of a stairway. At the bottom of the stairway is a state of peace, calm, and relaxation.  Take note of how you are feeling right now, at the top of the stairway.  Imagine taking a step down the stairway... a single step closer to relaxation. As you take this step, feel your arms relaxing. Becoming heavy. Limp... loose... relaxed.    Further descend the stairway, going down toward relaxation..... down.... down.... to a state of calm and relaxation. Feel your legs relaxing and becoming limp. Your legs are feeling very heavy.... so heavy... feel your legs sinking down, the heaviness pulling your legs down into relaxation.  Picture yourself going slowly down the stairway, one step at a time. It is a comfortable, safe descent to a place of relaxation. Move down step by step, at your own pace, becoming more and more relaxed with each step you take.  Feel the heaviness in your arms and legs.... your arms are so warm and so heavy.... feel gravity pull on your arms gently, pulling your shoulders down into a relaxed position.  Take another step down.... and another.... more deeply relaxed with each step. Feel your neck and back relaxing. Feeling warm, loose... relaxed.  You might even become a bit sleepy as you get closer and closer to relaxation. That's okay.   Allow your mind to drift and your body to relax, heavy and comfortable. Your head and face relax.  Feel the muscles of your face becoming limp, soft, relaxed. Your eyelids are very heavy. It feels so good to close your eyes... your eyelids are so heavy, you cannot keep them open. So heavy and relaxed.  Moving down the stairway, down, down... almost to the bottom now.... when you reach the bottom you will be pleasantly relaxed.  The closer you get to the bottom, the heavier and more relaxed you feel. Your body is so heavy.... but at the same time feels light, as if floating. It is an unusual feeling, but pleasant. So peaceful. Drifting in calm relaxation.  Take the last few steps down to the bottom of the stairway..... sinking into relaxation. So heavy and relaxed.  Reaching the bottom now.... a state of calm and relaxation. You are now feeling peaceful and relaxed.  Now I'll repeat some affirmations for self-esteem. You don't even have to listen or pay attention, you can simply relax while I talk.  Just let your mind drift, and reflect upon these affirmations for self-esteem in the back of your mind, with your subconscious. You can take in the affirmations for self-esteem if you choose to and if they are a good fit for you, and disregard any that do not apply.  Just relax now and let your mind drift for the remainder of this affirmations for self-esteem script.  At the end of the script, I'll count back from 5 to 1, and you can choose to reawaken or drift off to sleep.... but for now, just relax... letting your mind drift.... there is nothing you need to do.... nothing you need to focus on.... just relaxed and calm.  Just let these words drift in your mind, without needing to focus especially on any of them.  You are a worthwhile person.  You are capable of achieving many things.  You deserve to be happy. You can be happy even through difficult circumstances.  You can handle the problems that come your way.  You are a strong person... while understanding that no one needs to be strong all the time.  You are an okay person.... a good person.  Your worth is not measured by achievements, appearance, or other external things. You are worthwhile as a person, just the way you are.  You are perfectly alright, just the way you are.  Accept yourself.  Be kind to yourself.  Take good care of yourself physically and emotionally.  You are okay the way you are.  (pause)  Continue to allow your mind to drift, as you just relax. Allow these affirmations for self-esteem to be true for you, repeating them silently in your mind if you want to, or simply taking them in.  I am a worthwhile person.  I deserve to be happy. I deserve good things.  I am a human being with flaws. It is okay to have flaws.   I am unique, and I appreciate my uniqueness.  I am perfectly alright, just the way I am.  I feel good about myself.  It is okay to like myself.  I am likable.  I have many good qualities.  I am a decent human being.  I do some things wrong and many things right.  I learn from my mistakes, and forgive myself when I make them.  I take time for myself. I deserve this time, and need this time.  I take care of others and I take care of me.  I accept help, support, and love from others.  I am confident.  I hold myself in high regard.  I like myself.  I accept myself.  I am not perfect, and that is okay.  I accept myself.  (pause)  Continue allowing your mind to drift.... relaxing. Let the affirmations for self-esteem become true for you, filling you with a sense of confidence and self-assurance.  You are capable of making positive changes.... capable of increasing your self-esteem.... and of nurturing your self-esteem.  Simply relax now, noticing what it is like to feel good about yourself.... allowing yourself to feel calm and confident.   (pause)  Keep with you this feeling of self-esteem. Remember the affirmations for self-esteem, taking them in and believing them as truth for you.  You can continue to feel good about yourself and keep this feeling of self-assurance, even after you are finished this affirmations for self-esteem script.  I'll count now from 5 to 1, and you can choose to drift off to sleep or become fully awake. When I reach one, you will be either in a state of deep sleep or you will be fully alert and awake, depending on how you have chosen to conclude this affirmations for self-esteem script.  5  4  3  2  1  
0 Begin by taking a deep breath and hold it for 5 seconds…(pause for 5 seconds)…exhale and relax…(pause for 5 seconds)...take another deep breath, as deep as you can, and hold it, count for 5 seconds…(pause for 5 seconds) and as you exhale just imagine blowing out all of your stress…(pause for 5 seconds)...take a third deep breath and hold it…(pause for 5 seconds)...and as you exhale you blow out any stress you’ve been holding on to, saying to yourself “relax now”  [pause for 3 seconds, speaking now with confidence and at a normal pace of speech]  This is your new solution to stress.  Whenever you become stressed in the future, you simply take 3 fully in and deep breaths, holding it at the top of the inhalation for 5 seconds, and when you exhale, blow out any stresses that you feel.  And on the third breath as you exhale you simply say to yourself, relax now.  [Pause for 5 seconds] [speaking slowly with a soothing and gentle voice]  [Body Scan Induction]  Begin by slowly blinking your eyes, and with each number I say, blink once. (pause for 3 seconds in between each number) 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.  Allow your eyes to gently close, and when you do this you feel a wave of relaxation sweep over you.  [speaking even slower now]  Now I’d like for you to focus on the sensations at the top of your head.  Just notice how the very top of your head feels.  [Pause for 5 seconds]  And now let your focus move down to your eyes.  Just notice how your eyes feel and ask them to relax even more.  The little movement in your eyes is called rapid eve movement and is completely normal.
0 hello this is Sara Raymond with mindful movement thank you for taking the time to listen to this guided meditation to help reduce stress and anxiety this practice of relaxation is most beneficial when done regularly where the benefits are compounding and over time it will become easier for you while this practice of meditation will take many different forms and look different from person to person don't expect perfection be patient with your practice and the resulting effects if you find value from this and believe you know someone else that can benefit from listening please share with your friends and family the idea of being in the present moment is a powerful one when it comes to anxiety and stress we are often scheduled to the max and we become physically and emotionally stressed out we often find our mind cluttered and overthinking we worry about how the past could have gone differently where we wonder if the future will go as exactly as we plan it this meditation will help to calm down your overthinking mind it will help you to be present so that you can simplify and clear the clutter of your mind it has been said by many great thought leaders in this world but the way we do anything is the way we do everything so if we want to declutter our mind we must also declutter our physical world this mindfulness meditation can be used to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past and anxieties about the future more you practice this the easier it will become for you and you will see the benefits trickle over into many other areas of your life and now turn off all distractions and commit this time for yourself let go of your to-do lists and your responsibilities take this time for you for self-care of the gift to enjoy you must first help yourself and love yourself before you can help or love anyone else and when you are ready close your eyes and bring your full awareness to your breath begin to count your breath in then as you breathe out encourage the exhale to be one count longer than the inhale allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress and tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow and your body will calm down do this for a few breaths cycles then allow the breath to return to its natural rhythm know that your breath is an anchor to the present moment you know that you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment so you know you are always in the present moment when you are attentive to your breath as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer notice your thoughts and acknowledge them by saying in your mind thinking then come back to the breath and use this breath as an anchor to keep coming back to whenever your mind wanders this breath anchor is a grounding and stress relieving practice to continue outside of the session whenever you may experience a stressful situation at any point in life you can always just come back to your breath as if you are starting over this anchor will allow you to relax and times of stress as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and to slow down allow your body to soften and your breath to be gone know that your body responds to your thoughts so think about relaxing and ask your body for a release of tension your mind is so powerful in creating change in all aspects of your life and now as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up as you breathe out that white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of anxiety take a long slow deep breath in through your nose and now move the breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to just surrender as you exhale breathing out anything that no longer serves you each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even more deeply and now invite your body to relax each muscle completely begin with the muscles around the eyes and the jaw by relaxing these muscles specifically the rest of the body knows exactly what to do and will relax in response continue to unclench the jaw completely and soften the muscles around the eyes to begin to feel that familiar heaviness throughout the entire body all you have to do is think about relaxing and releasing the tension in your body and your body will respond because it listens to what your mind tells it and now feel the entire body let go feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside stay with your breath when you find your mind wandering stay with the physical sensations of your body so that your mind can continue to clear the clutter of the overthinking tendency know that your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you you are in complete control but for now your mind and body know it is time to relax and let go time to slow down right now all sounds around you are unimportant and they just add to your relaxation all responsibilities and items on your to-do list are unimportant right now all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow your body to relax and your subconscious mind will do the job of clearing the clutter notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper you now allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go letting your body mind and spirit become one and now begin to use your imagination and take a moment to see yourself in front of a beautifully decorated glass elevator door this class door is etched and frosted with the most amazing design on it see this design in your mind reach out and feel the texture with your fingertips feel the cool temperature of the glass this elevator will take you down to the deepest part of your subconscious mind so that you can declutter your thoughts release tension and negativity you see the door slowly opening and you step into the spacious elevator you know you are completely safe and you can see through the glass walls of the elevator you push the B button so that you can go down to the basement of your mind this elevator will lead you deep into relaxation each level will take you deeper down and in a moment as I begin to count the elevator will take you down slowly into a more deep relaxation you will find that a deeper down you go the more comfortable and the more relaxed you'll become 10 as the elevator begins at slow descent you are deeply relaxed you feel the stress melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do eight you know you are right where you need to be on your journey and you allow the outside world to just to turn off seven each level down takes you even deeper into a relaxed state six you're committed to taking your life and dreams to the next level five letting go completely for going deeper and deeper into comfort the REE almost to the basement of your subconscious mind - deep deep relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and peace and now we have reached the bottom the elevator doors slowly open and you walk out into the basement of your subconscious mind you take a look around and see that you have stepped out into what looks like a library that stores all of your memories as well as the possibilities for your future there are rows and rows of shelves throughout the entire room each shelf filled with many many books you see books of all different sizes and colors some of the books are disorganized and there are areas of clutter around the floor in front of some of the shelves you feel an intense desire to organize the books so that they are easily accessed when needed and to clean up the clutter around the room knowing that by doing this you will organize and declutter your mind and your life you realize that just by thinking about organizing and cleaning magically this room changes the room becomes well-organized and the clutter is cleared this change has simplified your life and with this change you feel a positive change within yourself you know that deep inside you a switch has been reset so that everything works in your favor you are now organized and decluttered in all areas of your life as well as your thinking mind you are able to generate support and inspiration for yourself far more easily than before you enrich yourself mentally emotionally and spiritually to do all that it takes to actualize your goals thrive and live in alignment with your values and intentions you begin to take even better care of yourself you redefine yourself as a happier energetic and more lighthearted person you feel the physical weight of anxiety has been lifted to allow you to be a lighter and calmer you allow new and more empowered thoughts and inspired feelings of success healing wellness and happiness to profoundly build within you you respect yourself showing yourself loving kindness and compassion and now you let go of any negative thoughts that no longer serve you you let go of any pasts negativities and you replace them with positive behaviors positive thoughts and feelings of gratitude you are aware of your thoughts and you have the ability to change from a negative thought to a positive one just by being aware you believe that you could be strong and confident in your life you see your past limiting beliefs and behaviors disappear self-doubt fear and anxiety are things of the past and you replace them with optimism confidence and an easily calm disposition you trust your instincts and your abilities you are easily able to accept things as they are knowing that you are exactly where you are supposed to

0 This practice provides a different lens through which you can examine the body.  Give yourself space to drop in and deeply investigate these elements in your body.  Try to bring an open mind, and see what you can learn about yourself.  Remember that mindfulness is about seeing clearly, and looking at things from a new perspective can often bring that clarity.  Settle into a relaxed position.  Close the eyes, and bring your awareness to the places in the body where you experience contact, such as the feet on the floor, the hands in the lap, or the body sitting in the chair.  Begin with the element of earth or solid form.  Without thinking too hard about what this means, openly examine where and how you can feel solidity.  This might be the structure of your skeleton, the chair you’re sitting on, any places of tension in the body, or the weight of your muscles as they relax.  Don’t rush through these sensations or try to force them.  When you feel the earth element in the body, stay with it for a few deep breaths.  Continue this seeking, recognizing, and feeling for a few breaths.  After five minutes, switch to the element of air or wind.  An obvious place to start is in the form of the body breathing.  Where can you feel the air of the breath?  You may also look for places in the body where you can feel empty space—  the nostrils, the mouth, and the ears can offer insight into the air element.
0 Begin by getting comfortable. You may want to sit or lie down. Close your eyes, or focus your gaze on one spot in the room.  Start to relax your body, beginning with your feet. Allow a feeling of relaxation to fill your feet...feeling heavy, loose, and relaxed. Relax your ankles...lower legs...and knees.  Allow the relaxation to continue, relaxing your upper legs. Let the muscles of your legs completely let go...feeling very heavy and relaxed.  Relax your hips and pelvis, and all the surrounding muscles. Feel your stomach and lower back relaxing...the muscles giving up their hold.  Feel the relaxation in your chest, back, and sides...feeling very relaxed...very heavy.  Let your hands relax, all the way from your fingertips to your wrists. Feel your lower arms relaxing...letting go. Relax your elbows and upper arms...loose and heavy.  Relax your shoulders, feeling them lowering slightly...finding a comfortable, relaxed position...free from tension...  Allow the muscles of your neck to relax...letting go...and relax your face and head.  Feel your entire body relaxing even more deeply...becoming completely relaxed...limp...heavy...comfortable.  Now turn your attention inward...even more deeply inside...to find your authentic self.  Begin by reflecting upon your values. What is the most important to you in life? What do you value? Where does your sense of right and wrong come from? Spend the next few moments thinking about your values.  (Pause)  The values you have been thinking of make up part of the core of who you are. If you are being true to your values, these core beliefs will drive your behavior.  It feels good to behave in ways that are consistent with your values. For example, if honesty is something you value, this could be reflected in your life by being truthful. If you value your family, perhaps your life reflects this in the time you spend with family members.  Think about how your values can be a part of your day-to-day life.   (Pause)  Now consider what else makes you who you are. Finding your authentic self involves learning who you truly are. Your authentic self is the real you, the person you are truly meant to be. Your authentic self is the person you are the core, the person you can be if nothing holds you back.  Imagine the person you believe yourself to be right now. It's okay if you aren't quite sure who you are...just picture yourself going about the things you usually do in a typical day. Imagine that you are watching yourself...observing yourself going about your usual activities.  See yourself getting up in the morning...going about your day...imagine the things that you do in a typical day. See yourself doing these activities.  Picture this person...you...standing in an empty room. Imagine watching this person...observe...now imagine you could strip away all the things that hold you back from your full potential. Imagine self-doubt dissolving...being replaced with confidence and self-assurance. Picture this person before you, and imagine all the things that get in the way of success...such as circumstances, lack of resources, lack of forgiveness, illness, baggage from the past...anything that is holding this person back in any way at all...   See these problems dissolving...disappearing...going away...  Now imagine this person, standing in the empty room. What is left? Who is this person when all those barriers are stripped away?  This person is you. Imagine who you are at the core...the pure character that is left when there is nothing to get in the way of complete self-expression.  You may only have a vague picture in your mind right now...let's allow that picture to come into focus...becoming more clear...  Think of your motivations...what motivates you? What drives your behavior? What catches your interest...or has caught your interest in the past? What propels you to action?  Think about your personality and character traits...the characteristics that are left when all barriers are removed and all fears have gone away. At your fullest potential, your simplest form...with no fears...what traits do you have? Think about your energy...are you laid back and calm, or are you energetic? Think about your other characteristics...  Are you introverted or extroverted?  Quiet or talkative?  Are you creative?  Are you practical?  What sorts of things do you appreciate?  What do you admire?  What do you like?  Imagine something that makes you feel happy...what is it?  Think of some things you enjoy...things that you like to do...  Think about all the characteristics of the person who is left when all barriers and fears are removed.  (Pause)  Now let's create a different picture. Imagine yourself as a young child, in a happy moment. See the potential in this child. Who is this young person? What makes this child who he or she is?  (Pause)  Think about the characteristics that you share with this child. In what ways are you similar? In what ways does the current you differ from this child? Think about how you have learned and grown since the time you were a small child.  (Pause)  Now picture yourself as the child...see the world through your younger self's eyes.  What did you want to be when you grew up? What hopes did you have for your future self? What dreams did you have as a child?  The hopes and dreams you had as a child were probably related in some way to your authentic self. Something about your dreams was connected to a part of your true self. What do these aspirations say about who you are? What personal characteristics of yours are related to your childhood dreams?  For example, if as a child you dreamed about becoming an astronaut, you probably have some personality traits that relate to this dream...such as being adventurous, curious, analytical...  Think about your own childhood dreams, and see what these dreams say about who you are.  (Pause)  Now create one final picture in your mind. Imagine, in as much detail as you can, the person you want to be. Imagine your ideal self...  How would this person behave? What does this person, your authentic self, value? What motivates this ideal self? What personal characteristics are present in this ideal version of you? Imagine all the details of the person you most want to be.  (Pause)  The image in your mind right now, of this ideal person, is you. This is your authentic self. This is who you are. At the core, beneath all of life's getting in the way...this is you.  Spend a few moments with this image of your authentic self.  Now allow yourself to step inside this image, and fully become this person. Become who you are. For this moment, just be...simply be your authentic self.  Feel a sense of calm and serenity...secure in who you are...knowing who you are. This is you. Your authentic self.  You can take this authentic self with you...allowing this true essence of you to shine through in everyday life. Allow your values, personality, and motivations to shine though...to guide your behavior...to make up who you are.  You have always been this person...you always will be your authentic self...a positive, confident person. A person you like and appreciate. Underneath the challenges, the baggage, the demands of living life...this is the real you that will always be with you.  (Pause)  It's time to reawaken now...to conclude this relaxation exercise...  Keep the image of your authentic self with you as you go about the rest of your day. Express this true self...and allow you to simply be you.  Wiggle your fingers, waking up your hands and arms...  Move your toes, allowing your feet and legs to wake up...  Feel your muscles reawakening...and your whole body filling with energy.  Open your eyes and sit quietly for a moment while you reorient to your surroundings...  When you are completely awake and alert, you can return to your usual activities, feeling confident and calm, in touch with your authentic self.
0 when you can route yourself in the present moment it allows you to let go of the worry of what's to come in the future and possible regrets about what has happened in the past create a safe and tranquil environment for yourself to experience the stress relief of being present this practice will not only relieve the stress you may be experiencing now but also releases stress you may be carrying from the past hello and welcome I'm Sara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing let's settle in to this relaxing meditation I invite you to make yourself as comfortable as possible find a position that you can be relaxed yet alert  [Laughter]  make any adjustments to your posture or your surroundings so that you can come into a place of effortless ease perhaps close your eyes or soften your gaze take in a deep breath through your nose and sigh it out through your mouth take two more breaths just like this to begin to calm your body and mind and now enjoy the easy flow of your natural breath today we will use our senses to observe the present moment mindfulness is in essence the practice of bringing your awareness into the present moment begin now to use your sense of hearing to broaden your field of awareness listen to the sounds in your immediate surroundings what noises can you hear that are close to you  are there sounds of the heater or air-conditioning running is there a clock ticking  do you hear birds or animals are there cars or other vehicles bringing noise to your awareness listen to the sound of my voice to be in a relaxed state in this present moment what is the subtlest sound that you can detect when you listen even if you have headphones on maybe you can detect a quiet buzz on the recording or some other sound in the background what would it be like to let the sounds around you come to you rather than working to search them out are you able to hear your own sounds the sounds of your breathing this is the practice of observation without judgment it is not about what you find but that you are looking let these sounds be your teacher of the present moment experience rather than a distraction begin to let the intensity of your listening fade as if the sounds blur into the background of your focus  and then become aware of what you can see while you likely have your eyes closed do you see blackness on the inside of your eyelids or do you detect the smallest amount of light coming through maybe you can see patches or swirls of color  take a moment to notice all that you can see  inviting your attention now to move to your sense of smell notice the most prevalent smell you can detect  perhaps it is the scent of your body care products or maybe there are flowers in the room or maybe you are simply aware that there seems to be no specific smell around you  remember this is about bringing your awareness into the present moment by noticing your senses rather than judging or labeling good or bad  let your awareness move now to anything you can taste do you notice the faint taste of toothpaste or a minty gum  perhaps you're aware of the taste of your last drink or meal still lingering inside your mouth or you may simply notice the wet sensation in your mouth allow your awareness to notice what your physical body is experiencing now feel the sensation that draws your attention most prominently again no need to judge or label good or bad just notice [Music] notice the areas where your body meets the support beneath you become aware of where your clothes or your hair subtly brush your skin [Music] since the energy where one part of your body is touching another part can you sense the vibrations of your energy what do you feel at the palms of your hands is there energy vibrations or a sense of buzzing there [Music] do you feel a certain temperature in your fingertips often times we can connect to our own innate energy simply by attending to the energy of our hands what is the volume of what your body is telling you are there areas that are louder than others asking for you to listen are there any subtle messages being offered within you [Music] as you are attending to the sense of touch in various ways take a moment to soften and release anywhere you can since the shift in your body [Music] [Music] it is often said there is a sixth sense the sense is the power of perception similar but not one of the five physical senses it is a strong intuitive power by connecting with your feelings and emotions during meditation you can develop this instinct or sixth sense listen inward for what you are feeling right now is there contentment or peace [Music] what are the other qualities you are aware of when you quietly observe look inward not inwards or labels but in sensations and feelings without judgment these sensations and the awareness of the sensations the listening inward it allows you to connect with your body and your heart listen to your heart what do you hear from your heart right now [Music] it's okay if it seems nothing is coming to you now it will this is the practice of present moment observation and opening to the possibilities of what you may find [Music] we practice witnessing the present moment because stress is experienced when living in the past or the future peace is found right here right now move towards peace take a moment longer to notice your senses again perhaps you can become aware of all of your senses at the same time or choose to scan through them each again  take another deep breath with your eyes still closed as you slowly invite your field of awareness to broaden outward once more notice sounds sights smells tastes and feelings  as you are beginning to open your field of awareness and sense your surroundings see if you can do so while you continue to stay connected with your inner experience and when you feel ready gradually let a little light in through your eyes and take in your surroundings once more continue to practice using your senses to come to the present moment any time throughout your day to experience a sense of peace in the now thank you so much for practicing with me today I hope you have a peaceful and calm day
0 welcome to the daily calm let's start today's session by finding a comfortable position with a tall straight back allow your arms to rest gently when you're ready close your eyes bring full attention to this very moment settling in and allowing the mind and body to still and with openness patience and curiosity bring your awareness to the breath a deep breath in and releasing it fully follow the breath as it flows in and out of your body taking one last deep breath before letting the breath settle allowing it to feel natural and easy don't try to force the breath or regulate it in any way just allow it to flow naturally on its own so and we'll scan down the body now concentrating our attention from part to part start by bringing your attention to the top of your head and scalp feeling whatever's happening in this area you might feel tingling or heat throbbing or soft vibrations there may be strong sensation or you might not feel much at all now lower your attention to your forehead face and jaw allow the muscles here to relax on your next out breath let that sensation dissolve lower your focus to the neck letting the throat and sides and back of the neck soften notice any sensation that arises on the surface of the skin or deeper within now bring your attention to your shoulders noticing if there's any tension or strain breathe into your shoulders and if any parts feel tight allow them to relax extend your awareness down the arms towards the wrists palms and fingers on the next out breath allow them to soften now come to the chest observing the rise and fall of each breath notice how the lungs expand and contract direct your attention to your upper and lower back there may be some intensity is this is an area where we commonly hold stress if you notice any tension or warmth or discomfort just observe what's there with each breath you take soften just a little bit more moving your focus around your abdomen notice it expanding filling up with air and slowly emptying on the exhale and bring your attention to your pelvis notice where your body makes contact with the ground or your chair and direct your breath into this area relaxing into stillness now scan your legs observing your thighs notice where they make contact with your cushion or chair lowering your attention to your knees and your shins and calves let your legs soften intentions release when you're ready breathe into your ankles your feet and toes let them relax and become soft sinking into a state of relaxed awareness and as we near the end of the session take a moment to notice how you feel you may find that you're more relaxed as this is often a common outcome of meditation this is one of the reasons why it's so helpful to meditate during times of stress when we're experiencing stress our amygdala fires up and it's difficult to make thoughtful decisions so if we find our mind is clouded due to overwhelm we can use meditation as a tool to calm the mind down ideally we want to meditate in a preventative way so we don't get to that point the practice is here for you whenever you need it and as we near the end of the session bring your attention back to the room wiggle your fingers and toes and slowly open your eyes i hope you enjoyed today's daily con i invite you to bring this state of peace with you into the day and we'll see you back here tomorrow you
0 hey dear love if you're experiencing negative thoughts that's okay allow yourself to be okay with the not okayness and with that energy around you give yourself permission to get into whatever position feels comfortable for you and when you feel ready gently close your eyes turn your awareness towards your breath i really want you to focus on your belly throughout this meditation allow your lower abdomen to expand on every inhale and contract on every exhale all the while allowing your upper chest to remain relatively calm still and neutral this helps signal to our body that we are safe it's okay to slow down it's also okay to listen to whatever quote unquote negative thoughts that are going on within you because truly the only way to release them is to love them you don't need to love the thoughts so much as love yourself through the thoughts a simple example before we begin the practice is to not think about the color green [Music] what happens when i tell you to not think about the color green [Music] very often when we're told not to think of something or we try to not think of something we just think about it more [Music] when we instead shift our focus [Music] that's when we can start to change but it all begins with acceptance and love so whatever the key prominent negative message that has been coming up for you is present simply let it be as you turn into your breath remember stomach expands on every inhale and contracts on every exhale let yourself know that you are not this thought and it's okay that it showed up all of our quote unquote negative thoughts are actually just teachers in disguise so recognize if only for a moment you are separate from this thought imagine that it is just a scared wounded part of your own child-like self and extend love towards it for whatever piece of you had this thought is likely tied to some scared wound within a frightened inner child show love and compassion towards yourself for whatever you're feeling tied to these negative emotions let yourself know you are here for yourself you are here to love and accept yourself no matter what thoughts come to mind no matter what emotions are caused by the thoughts and vice versa you've got your back loving yourself in this way may bring about an emotional reaction of some kind simply allow whatever you experience if it feels good to you you may even embrace yourself wrapping your arms around yourself [Music] letting yourself know it's okay you're here for you you love and accept yourself no matter what thoughts or emotions are present you're not here to push them away you're not here to judge them or beat yourself up for them you are here to love yourself through them [Music] as you offer up this love and acceptance towards whatever thoughts are present again if there's multiple select just one right now for the purpose of this next step that negative thought is [Music] tune in to what emotions it may bring up for you if your arms are still wrapped around you you may choose to keep them there or let them come back down to your sides trust whatever feels best to you [Music] and as you let yourself be present with both this thought and emotion you allow yourself to get clear on what its opposite would be for example a common negative thought i've experienced is that i'm not good enough [Music] and the emotions accompanying our despair and doubt the opposite would be that i am good enough i am more than enough and the emotions would be trust optimism practice this with yours identify what the opposite of your negative statement is now identify what the opposite of your negative emotions are [Music] now now that you know this new positive statement and feeling you can recognize that those those emotions those statements we were referring to as negative were actually just teachers guiding you back towards this desire you have a desire to feel the way that you just identified [Music] we don't have negative thoughts about things we don't care about they're just showing us where we really care about something [Music] tune into that positive statement you just created the opposite of the negative statement you started with [Music] if it feels good to you say this new statement out loud [Music] if possible make it an i am statement [Music] how do you feel saying this if it still does not quite feel true you can say i am willing to believe followed by your new statement give that a try i am willing to believe link fill in the blank with your new positive statement notice how this willingness to shift into this new positive statement feels as you start to make this shift into more positive thoughts you gain momentum thereby attracting even more positive thoughts anytime you feel yourself slipping into thoughts that are perhaps considered more negative be grateful towards them for their only being guide posts showing you where you are able to look more closely at your desires in fact take the initial negative thoughts that you switched in this practice and begin to feel gratitude towards it it helped you identify this new desire this new positive affirmation you also start to extend gratitude towards yourself for you showed up as an alchemist today you sat in your power and transformed fear to love say thank you to yourself for this if it feels good to you you may give yourself another warm embrace and you can return to this process over and over again with any unwanted thoughts you are fully capable of transforming them into gold [Music] take this feeling with you as you begin to roll your shoulders wiggle your fingers and toes really focusing on this new positive statement and when you're ready slowly open your eyes back to the world around you amazing job today it's so powerful to look at your fears with love be proud of yourself for doing this and know that we are proud of you too and we're so thankful to you for being here we so hope this served if you feel cold share your new positive statement below and we can all hold space for the positive statements see you in the next meditation you
0 thank you for being here dear soul i'm kenneth and from my heart i welcome you to this guided meditation you can make yourself as comfortable as you can right now in this moment allow yourself to just be here and now observing the words i share with you like a soft breeze on a summer night noticing whatever it is that you notice your body may begin to relax more and more as you listen to my voice and go deeper within trust that your body can find its best way to let go naturally don't need to relax it may be that your body needs to heal in other ways it's good to know that your unconscious mind is an expert in healing and balancing in a safe and natural way while you can just flow with the experience change is a natural aspect of life like a tree that lets go of its leaves the seasons changing the sea changing from liquid to air [Music] and become aware of your breathing imagine now that you're breathing in that life energy through the soles of your feet breathing it up through your body and breathing out the top of your head breathing in through the soles of your feet breathing out the top of your head and out of your fingertips and some people notice that life energy like a tingling sensation or numb sensation in their feet or in their hands or fingertips [Music] there is no right or wrong way to flow with this experience there is an old story about a buddha statue perhaps your arms and feet will get heavier as you listen to this story and you can enjoy that in your own way because people can you know experience a pleasant deepening sense of comfort as they allow their body to relax and they relax deeply in the mid 50s a monastery was to be relocated to make room for a new highway the monks arranged for a crane to come and move a 10 feet tall clay buddha to its new location when the crane started to lift the statue it was much heavier than expected and it began to crack wanting to protect the priceless shrine the monks lowered it back down and decided to wait until the next day to bring more powerful equipment to add insult to the injury the rain came in so the monks covered the statue with tarps to keep the moisture away in the dark of night the head monk took his flashlight and went out to make sure the buddha was still covered when the light of the flashlight shone into the crack of the clay he saw a glimmer a reflection of something underneath the shroud of clay he immediately started to carefully chisel away shards of clay to find that the glimmer grew brighter hours later when all the clay had been removed he was in the presence of a buddha made of solid gold as you continue to listen the positive and valuable words i will share with you now have already started to activate a process of chiseling away old clay of worries fear stress and anxiety in your subconscious mind and this will continue with every second and every minute with every breath now i wonder if you can imagine yourself walking on a warm beach this can be any beach you like either one you imagine or a beach you know you are there by yourself imagine walking so close to the sea that some of the waves touch your feet i don't know what you notice the most if it's the sound of the waves maybe it's the sight of the sea the sky the sand or maybe it's the warmth the feeling of sand and water on your skin or maybe it's that fresh clean and high vibrational air or a combination suddenly you realize that there is a thick rope tied around your waist behind you at the end of the rope there is a big old anchor that weighs heavy from accumulated thoughts worries and fears from the past and about the future they hinder you they have held you back berated you from inner peace and harmony from joy and freedom the rope is going into your skin with each step in front of you now further ahead something glimmering in the sand catches your attention you walk towards it dragging that heaviness with you when you come closer to it you realize that it is a blade it looks and feels like it is from ancient times like there is an energy link between you and that blade [Music] and suddenly you notice your name appears on the handle of that blade while a part of you is curious your higher self knows that this blade is here for a reason like life has given you an opportunity chance a choice to deliberately cut the rope and let it all go cut the rope now let go of all the worries and unwanted feelings you've been dragging with you [Music] maybe you feel a sense of relief a sense of freedom lightness or something else maybe your body is working through this in its own way some people even shed tears and shake a bit when they finally let go the way you go through this is the way that is right for you and it is safe for you to let go now imagine the waves crashing into the anchor as it starts to magically rust to pieces right before your very eyes it is safe for you to let go now the anchor disappears more and more with each new wave the rope dissolves while it floats further and further from shore imagine the sun surrounding you with a radiant light energy shining down enveloping you filling you with a peaceful silence and quietness which flows through your veins permeating every cell in your body feel every atom every molecule of your body mind and spirit allowing yourself to be healed and balanced becoming very aware of that deep sense of peacefulness inside you as you do so and i'll leave you in silence for a few moments as your body mind heart and spirit continues the process of letting go and heal and you're doing good [Music] the sun is communicating these compassionate words with every atom every molecule of your body mind and spirit you can feel calm now and balanced and this calmness and sense of balance is going to grow and grow each day more and more more focused peaceful and calm while your subconscious mind is enjoying and absorbing all the beneficial suggestions that i am giving you in a safe and natural way and you're doing doing good you are taking control of your mind body and emotions you are feeling better and better feeling calm harmonious relaxed at all times that calmness that inner peace is growing and spreading through and around your body and as you continue to relax the things in life that were not giving you a positive experience now they seem to calm you now they seem to make you stronger now they seem to connect you with your inner strength and power whatever you experience in life you are bigger than that you are a part of something much bigger than yourself you choose to show up in your life and honor the opportunity that you have been given you are pure life force in human body you are life you are worthy [Music] that you start walking forwards along the beach leaving footprints in the sand the sun still beaming its powerful celestial energy upon your being you feel surprisingly more free imagine that every step every footprint represents patterns that are not supportive of your intention to live your full potential [Music] and it is safe for you to let go now let go now so you walk steadily and courageously towards your new future after a while you turn around maybe you notice that your footprints are being washed away by the waves your first steps are gone now washed away [Music] let go now and it is safe and you're doing good good for each step you take the lighter and more free you feel walking more and more effortlessly towards your new future much more free ahead of you there is a person approaching it is you it is you one month from now notice how relaxed that future you feels notice how good that future you feels that balanced energy is emanating from that you over there the future you comes towards you and gives you the warmest most compassionate hug that you have felt in a long time all that love that love unconditionally flowing between you the future you says thank you thank you for taking care of me i love you thank you for being so compassionate to me thank you for loving me and accepting me for who i am [Music] the effect of these positive words will be reinforced in your dreams compounded in your sleep you'll wake up tomorrow feeling marvelous looking forward to another great day in your life you feel confident to do all the things you want to do and it's getting easier and easier and situations that used to bother you now they just seem to make you stronger they seem to connect you with your inner power and it's getting easier and easier you are understanding the bigger picture

0 thanks for joining me today for another mindful tip today i want to chat about stress a little bit you probably at some point in your life have experienced stress anxiety maybe panic maybe sensations of air hunger freak out whatever you want to call it and if you have it you probably know someone that has stress is really important to our physiology it's something that we actually rely on to survive in many ways unfortunately in today's world the mechanisms around stress can can backfire in some way so what used to help us stay alive can often you know the same elegant mechanism designed for that can backfire and kind of disregulate our nervous system so you know acute stress is really useful but over time chronic stress even if it's a low grade can really disregulate our autonomic nervous system and that could influence our breathing patterns and what happens is once our breathing pattern is affected negatively it could kind of feed back into that loop meaning now that you're not breathing uh optimally that leads to more chronic stress because breathing poorly whether it's you know your mechanics of breathing or like how many breaths you take in a minute or so forth though that in itself can be a stress and can kind of feed that loop now the cool thing is is we we could interact with that mechanism somewhat simply so today i wanted to give like one style of breathing that i find really useful from an application standpoint in everyday life now the breath pattern i'm gonna talk about today there's they're styles that have been used that tap into the same mechanism for a really long time so if you study yogic breath patterns you know a lot of them cultivate the same qualities that this does but sometimes to really practice those thoroughly you want to be in a fairly controlled environment you want to be sitting still in a room you want to have probably no responsibilities on your calendar for the next 20-30 minutes whereas what i'd like to talk about today i feel can be inserted into your life a lot easier uh more often for less amount of time so the application um you know really presents an opportunity for us when we're trying to navigate the stresses especially acute stresses of our life especially if you tend towards like anxiety panic and sometimes feelings or sensations of air hunger like you can't get enough breath oftentimes what happens when we feel that way we can make things worse by breathing faster or deeper everybody's heard the term you know relax take a deep breath and in some ways that could be helpful but there's also ways where that deep breath if it's rapid can exacerbate our situation so this pattern probably falls under the style of buteyko breathing that you might be familiar with and if you're not i definitely recommend a deep dive in that realm and it taps into one of the qualities that i think is important to develop and kind of it's important muscle to flex and that would be carbon dioxide tolerance so carbon dioxide is often thought of as like a waste product that's not useful to us but it's actually really important when dealing with anxiety or stress and carbon dioxide is a excuse me i got some critters behind me making noise carbon dioxide is a signaling molecule that our body relies on it plays a role in regulating the ph of our body and in doing so it signals our body's release of oxygen from hemoglobin into our tissues so oftentimes when we're breathing poorly because we're stressed or if we're stressed because we're breathing poorly we'll have a sensation like we're not getting enough air and sometimes that means because our oxygen is low and our carbon dioxide is high but in building tolerance to that level of carbon dioxide we can shift those sensations so we could shift the experience that we have in the moment to what we feel like we're not getting enough air to a place where we feel calm and that our breathing is not a problem it's kind of a fascinating concept that seems contradictory at first until you try it and some folks will struggle when trying this at least at first but it works it's really great i personally have relied on it many times and i think it's an important tool to have in our tool kit when things just arrive in our day-to-day situation where we notice that you know our breathing is off and we're and we're feeling stressed and on the edge of anxiety or panic the idea here in general is to slow down your breath to take fewer breaths and the way i like to do this and the way i've taught many folks where they could successfully integrate it is by first focusing on the inhale so as you're inhaling to try to take in your breath slower so the tendency might be to breathe more and to breathe faster so that you can breathe more but to actually do the opposite which could feel uncomfortable at first and what you're looking to do is kind of flirt with this edge of discomfort where it's a little uncomfortable but you can do it and if at any point it's too uncomfortable you could take a deep breath breathe naturally and kind of reset and start over but think of your breath being like a wave where you have an inhale and an exhale and the idea here is to slow down that inhale maybe not take as much air and then let your exhale kind of drag out and some folks will even try to create a little breath hold at the end of the exhale which is useful but not necessary so a good place to start if you want to apply structure so you have something to focus on like a count what i recommend would be to breathe in for a count of three and out for a count of three and very quickly let the exhale become longer so maybe your desire would be to breathe in for four or five but like slow that down don't take as much air in and then try to relax the body on the exhale so you're taking that wave and you're making it smaller in height essentially and stretching it out so the goal would be to eventually take fewer breaths over a given amount of time by slowing them down one thing that also might help focusing on this is the sound that your breath makes generally if you take a deep or fast breath it'll have an audible sound that you could hear from i don't know from the inside of your head somewhere so think of breathing where it doesn't really make a sound so slowing it down where there's not a lot of wind your breath is creating and not a lot of sound that it's generating so very slow soft inhale and then on the exhale over your breath cycles allowing that to drag out longer and longer and what i like to do on that exhale is try to relax my body so maybe starting with the stomach somewhere that feels somewhat central to where the activity of the breath is and relaxing it maybe relaxing the belly maybe relaxing the neck or shoulders if there's an area that you know you have a tendency of holding tension maybe focusing on relaxing that area on the exhale and if you can get to a point where you're in for three and maybe out for 9 or 10 or 12 which might take a few sessions to to get to what i find happens is within a fairly short period of time the way your nervous system feels like it's being expressed it just transforms so you can go to a place that you know you're on edge you're stressed right now in this moment feeling sensations of anxiety right now and within just a few minutes um really coming out to a different place where that sensation has really diminished which is an exciting thing it's like another example of what role we could play in our sense of well-being now this could be done really in any position i think because of the nature of how this is just slowly incorporated you can do this while you you're walking uh you know you're on a walk you can do it seated um i would maybe be careful doing it when driving but you know it could be integrated in a lot of different positions like wherever your orientation is it could even be played with during light levels of exercise movement if you're having difficulty doing it especially if you have the tendency of really breathing up here where your sternum and your shoulders are lifting on your inhale and you struggle with getting your breath to go more south in direction the thing the position that i feel is most useful would be laying prone meaning laying on your belly and what that does is it allows gravity to the weight of your body to kind of hold your rib cage in place a little bit so that you're there's there's a lot of movement in your ribs when you breathe but ideally it's not so much north it's more east west so when you're laying on your belly the weight of your body can hold your sternum in place a little bit and it allows it easier to direct your breath more downward and expand more laterally so if you find yourself having trouble with this from a seated or standing or walking position then just just lay down especially in the moment if you're in a moment where you're really experiencing anxiety and you want to see what you're capable of doing don't worry about trying to do it in a more i don't want to say advanced but you know while you're doing something else just lay down on your belly you could just put one hand on top of the other put your forehead on your hands or maybe if it's more comfortable turn your head to the side and put a cheek on your hands and just focus on slowing your inhale and then letting your exhale get longer and longer every cycle and trying to relax your body on that exhale it's a very effective pattern i encourage you to give it a try practice it when you're not in a place of anxiety or stress so that you feel a little bit more comfortable and then see if you could remember in the moment where you are experiencing uh increased stress or anxiety you know you could say oh i know what to do now i've practiced this and then go for it and then please let the community know what you notice so maybe in the comments you know give it a try and let us know what what you experience when you practice this pattern and if you want to learn more about different styles that tap in to these concepts the school of book tako breathing is an excellent resource and it's not hard to find information or videos about that so i hope you enjoyed this uh this tip and if you know someone that experiences anxiety and stress on a regular basis especially if it's like sensations of panic and air hunger this is a very useful strategy so please send it their way i hope you enjoyed have a great day
0 - [Narrator] Hi, and welcome to this meditation for self-love. (gentle meditative music) I'd like to invite you to gently close your eyes and take a nice, slow, deep breath in, deeper than you've taken all day so far. And as you exhale, concentrate on the sound of my voice, allowing it to ground you into the present moment. And give yourself permission right now to focus on you, making yourself your first priority. There's nowhere else you need to be. There's nothing else you need to be doing, except giving yourself this time for your own care, for your own well-being. Continue breathing, allowing each inhale to be a bit deeper than the one before it, feeling your lungs expand out as you inhale, and feeling everything contract back in as you exhale. Returning your breath now to its normal pattern and its normal rhythm, but continue to follow the journey of your breath through your entire body. Feeling it weave in and out of your muscles and your cells. Allowing it to still you, and ease any tension or tightness you may be feeling. Now I'd like you to turn your attention to the bottom half of your body, everything from your hips all the way down to the tips of your toes. Breathing into them. Noticing any judgments that come up about any of these areas. We all have parts of our body that we wish were different, but instead of judging them, now turn your focus to sending love and appreciation into these areas. Shifting your focus now to your upper body, from your stomach to the crown of your head, feeling into these areas, noticing any tension or tightness you may be having, breathing into that area to help it release. Noticing any judgments that come up in these areas. And gently, replacing that judgment with love and appreciation. And now begin to call to mind other parts of yourself that you've held in judgment in the past, maybe a thought pattern or a behavior you exhibited. Maybe it was a choice you made, or something you said you wish you could take back. Maybe a time where you felt you could have handled something better. Look at it from a place of total curiosity. Watch the judgment come up, because it will, and watch the stories that you've told yourself about the situation come up, because they will, too. And then gently let those go, and offer yourself forgiveness, knowing that you were doing the best you could at that time. And now as we move into the silent part of the meditation, continue this journey on your own, calling to mind any parts of yourself that you hold in judgment, and giving them unconditional love, acceptance, and forgiveness. Continue breathing with your eyes closed. Let your attention start to focus back on my voice. When we judge parts of ourself, we actually hold them separate from us, and if we're holding parts of ourself separate, then we can't feel whole. Real self love is holding our light with the dark, of loving those parts of ourselves unconditionally we previously held in judgment. No one else can do this for us. Give yourself all the love that you need. It's inside you. Now let's take three more deep breaths together, a deep inhale in, holding it for a beat, and exhale it out. Again, an even deeper breath than the one before, feeling that breath weave in and out of all of your muscles and cells. And exhale out. Last time, your deepest breath yet, sending that oxygen all the way down to the tips of your toes, and as you exhale, feel it traveling back up your body, and when it hits the top of your head, and you're ready, you can open your eyes. Thank you for joining me for this meditation and giving yourself this gift.
0 Hello and welcome to this healing session for anxiety.  Get into a comfortable and relaxed position and just let go of all your daily stresses.  Allow yourself to just be here and now, letting your body just be.  You don't have to do anything because our bodies naturally want to be calm and relaxed.  Sometimes thinking too much or being tense and being anxious doesn’t allow for us to relax.  So naturally, we must let go of any need to control the present moment and future outcomes.  We feel anxious because we tend to over-analyze what we think will happen today, tomorrow or next week.  We do this out of habit because in the past, situations and outcomes that didn’t happen the way we expected, and we tend to feel that we need to be in control and be worried.  In order to change this habit, we must change our self-image and create new beliefs.  That's what this session will teach you, but first, we need to get in a relaxed state and go within, calming our mind with some breathing.  I will count down and with it number I say I want to fully inhale with your belly out and exhale tightening your belly.  And with each breath, you will feel more and more relaxed, taking you into a deep state of peace.  I will count down now.  5...Take a full in breath and as you exhale feel the tension loosen a little bit.  4...Take a nice deep breath in and as you exhale you feel even more relaxed and tensions let go.  3...Full breath in...and out.  Your mind is becoming calm and clear.  2...Inhale deeply and when you exhale observe how the need to control subsides as you become extremely relaxed.  1...As you take your last breath and exhale slowly you feel any tension is gone, and you are in complete peace and tranquility.
0 So, to reduce anxiety, start by taking a moment to relax your body.. soften any unnecessary tension in your belly and shoulder, and find a posture that feels both relaxed and alert.  Now close your eyes or look downwards and rest your hands in an easy effortless way.  Take a few moments to scan your awareness through the sensations of your body, and wherever possible, soften and release obvious areas of physical tension.  Relax your breath, and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. This may be a little unfamiliar, but when done is a natural, easy going way, it can be a very relaxing way to breathe.  In through your nose and out through your mouth.  In through your nose and out through your mouth.  Now let your belly be soft. If the belly is soft, more oxygen goes to the bottom of the lungs.  There’s better oxygen exchange.  Oxygen moves more easily into the blood, and it goes to all the cells in the body, including the cells in the brain, supplying your brain with the nourishment it needs.  If the belly is soft, it helps to activate the vagus nerve.  Vagus means wandering, and this nerve wanders up through the abdomen and chest, back to the central nervous system in the brain, and it promotes relaxation.  It is an antidote to the fight or flight stress response.

healing let's begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable feel free to sit or lie down so you can experience ease yet remain alert we will start this meditation with your eyes open with a soft gaze focus your line of vision on one point in front of you this can be a spot on the floor or the wall whatever draws your attention narrow your focus on this one single point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away see all there is to notice about this one point now slowly broaden your field of view like a camera lens widening with a relaxed awareness notice everything you can see in your current line of you without turning your head notice colors textures different materials and now slowly narrow your field of view once more to the same single point that you started with and as your focus continues to narrow draw it in until your eyes gradually closed and you allow your attention to turn inward [Music] as you begin to look inside and settle physically start with three deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth like a sigh take these three breaths at your own pace welcoming a slowing down of the momentum of your energy to gradually find stillness [Music] now begin to count your breath in then as you breathe out encourage your exhale to be one count longer than your inhale [Music] allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress and tension by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will slow and your body will calm down [Music] you can consciously relax do this for a few more breaths cycles on your own now enjoy the easy flow of your natural breath feel the cool air as it passes in through your nostrils and fills you up [Music] encourage each natural out-breath to release any remaining tension you may be feeling as you observe your breath you can allow it to naturally slow down become aware of your physical experience [Music] with your minds I notice first the palms of your hands notice the energy here perhaps you feel this as warmth or tingling or a buzzing sensation notice how simply moving your awareness to this part of your body moves your energy to this point by simply paying attention you have the ability to move energy and move a positive sensation within you similar to broadening your visual focal point begin to widen the experience of your sensations outward moving from your hands to awaken to the sensations in your body since the aliveness in your hands and in your feet feel the energy moving within you let your attention drift through the sensations in your body without directing it and without judging what you find and by you're moving attention on your body to direct your energy and your thoughts simply allow your focus to tune into the sensations of your body right here right now [Music] when you can do this live in this body since your own aliveness you are in the present and living in the space between your thoughts when your mind is attentive to the sensations of your body you can pause you can extend the gap between your thoughts in this space is where you can experience peace and calm [Music] notice if there is anywhere you can soften a little more look for anywhere you can let go even deeper into relaxation and ease let your physical body go so that you can let your thoughts go and now as I say each part of your body let your focus move to each part and encourage or release a complete relaxation to find ease in your body by simply moving your awareness throughout your body as I mentioned each part allow the surface below you to support you fully so there is no need to hold your position and you can be completely relaxed become aware of your feet notice this area and simply relax move your attention up from your feet and begin to release your lower legs and knees feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and goes deeper into relaxation as you allow it to let go and now find a sense of ease in your thighs and hips as you let go completely moving up noticing the area of your lower back and abdomen take a deep breath to move your energy and attention here to release any tightness in your lower back continue this process of increasing your comfort by moving your attention and therefore your energy as you do this welcome a feeling of softening into your abdomen let your chest and arms rest heavy on the surface below you moving your attention upward feel as your neck and throat release any physical and emotional tension you may be holding on to notice now the hinges of your jaw allow your jaw to unclench relaxing deeper and deeper still feel as the small muscles of your cheeks eyes and forehead soften and they go you may notice that as the small muscles in your face and jaw let go the rest of your body follows and softens even more still now your whole body is heavy relaxed and that ease you may sense that you are safe and supported and you are open to guiding yourself into a calm state of mind let yourself go let your mind and body go to a deep and relaxed State [Music] and now that you are fully relaxed you can begin the inward inquiry process by checking in with what is true for you notice what you are actually feeling giving yourself permission to experience in this present moment without trying to change anything let your thoughts come and go there is no need to attach to them or follow your thoughts imagine your thoughts are like a river flowing gently downstream let your thoughts go so you can be here now awake to the sensations in your body let your thoughts go so you can make room for the truth to surface in whatever form a comes simply allow it to surface make space for awareness and acceptance without judgment [Music] whatever you're feeling is okay these are simply patterns that have developed they are not you recognize any self talk going on in your mind and let your thoughts come and go allow yourself to move out of the thinking patterns and bring your attention to your felt experience no need to attach words or labels to your feelings simply explore what those feelings are pause and allow these feelings give yourself permission to be with this experience but your thoughts come and go [Music] if you find your mind drifting going back to old patterns of thinking or overthinking lovingly guide yourself back gesture your attention to come back to the present moment sensations once more being present is the way stay in the moment stay with the feelings and be okay with it continue to make space in your heart for whatever you are feeling and simply be stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment longer let your thoughts come and go continue to come back to the felt experience and move out of the thinking patterns and then take some time to nurture yourself place your hand on your heart if you like and offer love and kindness to yourself open your heart and let it in offer a positive energy to the area of your heart begin to deepen your breath once more allow your deepening breath to nurture yourself with care and compassion since an inner peace pause for just a moment longer to truly experience the positive sensations that are always within you when you are willing to slow down and look within when you slow down and stay with the sensations as long as you can you may find that you notice more you are able to live more fully without letting thoughts take over now as many times as you can look for what wants to be seen listen to what wants to be heard to do this slow down pause look inward look in between your thoughts quiet your thoughts to see hear and feel deeply inhabit your body fully and be open to life begin to reactivate each part of your body from its relaxed state feel the gentle refilling of energy back into your body awaken your body slowly and when you are ready open your eyes take this calm state with you as you go on with your day thank you so much for practicing with me I hope you have a peaceful day

of your energy to gradually find stillness begin to connect with your breath and if it feels right to you take a long slow deep breath in hold it for a moment and then slowly exhale fully empty out and allow any tension to melt away as you gradually relax more and more deeply with each breath as you continue to breathe intentionally allow your exhale to be slightly longer than your inhale to welcome ease and relaxation to flow throughout your entire body [Music] take another long slow deep breath in pausing again and then exhale empty your lungs completely with your out-breath [Music] and again take a deep breath in to signal to your body and mind that it is your time to fully relax take your time hold for a moment and then let it go perhaps you can already feel yourself drifting into a deep state of relaxation like the leaves being released from the trees in the season of fall you can let go to make room for new possibilities to develop and present themselves in your life [Music] consider each breath out as a time for releasing any unwanted energies and allowing the energy that you do desire to develop within you this is your time to heal and to let go with each exhale let go of any tension in your body scan for areas that are holding on to something and give yourself permission to let go of that tension with each exhale surrender to gravity let go of any resistance [Music] with each exhale let go and soften deeper and deeper into the surface below you allow your body to soften a little deeper now allow the out-breath to exhale tension from your body we'll let go of anything you might be holding on to from yesterday or earlier today [Music] let go of any to-do list that may be taking up space in your ID give yourself permission to be here right now doing just this sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission in order to let go of the past give yourself some space space for something new space to grow into what do you want to let go of right now [Music] what has become too heavy a weight to bear on your journey [Music] like the falling leaves it's time to clear out and free yourself of things you may have been afraid to let go of in the past without the falling of the leaves there can be no new growth let go of anger let go of guilt let go of grief [Music] let go of sadness let go of judgments let go of comparisons let go of shame [Music] let go of whatever is weighing you down these emotions may have served you in the past yet now it's okay to release them [Music] offer your awareness now to your physical body in this moment scan through the sensations of your body with a relaxed awareness free of judgement surrender any tension you may notice soften any areas you may be experiencing gripping or holding allow this surrendering to happen naturally throughout your body by simply offering your awareness to your body it is okay simply breathe and notice [Music] be aware of your inner physical experience just as it is you can allow yourself to simply be exactly as you are [Music] a peaceful mental state and an ease fulfill state are available when you are able to stop resisting your experience at any given moment when we want things to be different than they are that is when we develop resistance or tension today practice letting go of resistance be here now just as you are and you can get into the flow [Music] as you notice your body sensations accept them just as they are whether you may typically label these sensations as positive or negative settle into your body except being in your body right now just as you are be with the sensations you experience accepting all that you are there is no need to make a change during meditation be just as you are accepting allows you to fully experience what is happening in the present to fully engage in life [Music] listen to what your soul is sharing with you right now continue to be receptive to these sensations for a few moments longer with love and kindness for yourself feel the lightness that has washed over you as you have shed the weight that you have been carrying around for far too long we can learn from our faults and grow from our experiences if we allow them know that without experiencing suffering we also cannot experience joy without darkness we cannot know light allowing life just as it is can lessen any struggle and perhaps any additional and unnecessary suffering continue to soften soften from the surface all the way to deep within you release any guarding you may be holding on to surrender to anything you were holding on to for fear of losing let go of what could have been let go of worry of the possibility of a new way let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders let the sensations dissolve from your muscles every day we get a new chance to be in this moment it is okay simply breathe and notice surrender to the ability of your body to heal itself surrender to the love within you know your ability to give and to receive love surrender let go and be held by pure love trust you are loved in darkness and in light all of you is loved simply trust [Music] notice once more how you feel and allow yourself to feel just as you are for an even deeper connection with yourself surrender to your breath feel your body being breathed being moved by your breath trust it's okay simply breathe and notice [Music] notice the sounds in your environment just as they are here are the sounds as they come to you without searching them out allow the subtle noises to drift into your awareness with simple curiosity take interest in the sounds just as they are simply allow the sounds to be rather than seeing them as a distraction or an obstacle if you can practice accepting the sounds just as they are without the desire to change you can also begin to practice acceptance and surrender in other areas of your life frequently the word surrender has a negative energy to it you may think of having to give up something that is important to you or lose control over a situation Surrender does not mean giving up when the word surrender is used as a mindfulness practice it can also be the opportunity to give up anything that is no longer serving you or anything that is keeping you stuck [Music] consider this beautiful quote by Debbie Ford surrender is a gift that you can give yourself it's an act of faith it's saying that even though I can't see where the river is flowing I trust it will take me in the right direction [Music] any obstacle or challenge in your life might actually be taking you in the right direction allow the flow of the energy of life [Music] when you feel life brings you challenges you can't accept you have the opportunity to be transformed by acceptance you may add suffering when you resist the way things are because they aren't the way you expect or want them to be [Music] you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the way things are naturally there is a possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true peace is available when you stop resisting any given moment [Music] although you don't have control of what goes on beyond yourself you do have a choice as to how you respond to your experience and this choice gives you the opportunity to experience in our peace you can decide your attitude in any given circumstance noticing the sensations in your body with a relaxed awareness once more since that you now feel as if the weight of tension has been lifted and released from your body you sense that you are feeling lighter now almost as if you are floating and gravity has let go of its effects on you [Music] this lightness comes from letting go of anything and everything weighing on you both physically and emotionally it has been lifted completely out of your body [Music] this release allows you to feel lighter physically and you drift into a more productive sleep to prepare you for the day ahead [Music] let go of tension [Music] let go of pain let go of negativity and make room for the rejuvenation of a deep night's sleep let this come to you easily and effortlessly in your mind here these positive affirmations as your own beliefs hear them as truth in this present moment let these statements move you towards a spiritual surrender allow these ideas to help you drift into a deep healing state you don't have to do anything simply listen and allow sleep to come easily to you eventually my voice will fade away and you will drift off into a deep healing state of sleep for many hours I am ready to release the past and move forward now [Music] I am ready to surrender and move forward now [Music] I surrender I allow I accept I surrender by giving up attachments to results [Music] I am freely allowing and enjoying this moment I surrender all struggle I forgive myself I release all attachments coming from me I let go of expectations I create space for new beginnings I am supported loved and cared for things always work out for me when I relax and let go when I stay calm the answers come to me easily and effortlessly everything is as it should be obstacles are part of my path [Music] I let go of old habits and choose new positive ones I choose the responses to my experiences I allow the lessons I'm learning I am filled with positive actions [Music] I release anything that no longer serves me [Music] I welcome positivity into my life I am at peace with what is happening each new day offers a clean slate I welcome health and happiness [Music] I am worryfree I release anything that is holding me back from happiness I release fears of not being perfect [Music] I truly believe I am good enough I let go of all expectations I am free to live the life I dreamed of I let go of the need to control others I let go of anything that is holding me back I choose emotional freedom I release all thoughts that may be blocking my openness I let go of my regrets

little things in life [Music] I know I am okay I am exactly where I need to be myself compassion is building everyday my compassion for others is growing every day I am filled with love and kindness I radiate love and kindness outward I surrender to the intelligent higher powers of the universe I let go of resistance [Music] I am ready to release the past and move forward now I am ready to surrender and move forward now I surrender I allow I accept I surrender by giving up attachments to results I am freely allowing and enjoying this moment I surrender all struggle I forgive myself I release all attachments coming from me I let go of expectations I create space for new beginnings I am supported loved and cared for things always work out for me when I relax and let go when I stay

happening [Music] each new day offers a clean slate I welcome health and happiness I am worryfree I release anything that is holding me back from happiness I release fears of not being perfect I truly

0 Just as you take food into your body, consuming both healthy and not-so-healthy options, you also consume media throughout the day.  You listen to music, watch TV, read the news, and so on.  Although these may provide knowledge and entertainment, they can also create anxiety and stress in our minds and bodies or take us away from our connection to the mind.  This exercise offers a few different ways to bring mindfulness to these moments of consumption.  They don’t necessarily need to be done step-by-step.  First, consider what the impact may be of what you are choosing to consume.  Are you reading the news to inform yourself, or to fuel frustration?  Perhaps the television show you watch has quite a bit of violence and gets your nervous system going.  This isn’t to label a show, story, or song as good or bad.  It’s merely about recognizing the effects of your choice.  As you consume the piece of media, notice the response of the mind and body.  If you are watching TV, mute the volume during commercials to check in with yourself.
0 Please find a sitting position that allows you to be alert, your spine erect but not rigid, and also relaxed.  Now close your eyes and rest your hands in an easy effortless way.  Take a few moments to scan through your body, and wherever possible, soften and release obvious areas of physical tension.  We begin the practice of coming back by establishing our home base.  While there are many possible anchors such as sound or sensations throughout the body, the most common and the one we’ll be exploring here is the breath.  Please breathe naturally and simply notice where the breath is easiest to detect and where the breath also feels pleasant or at least neutral.  So you might be paying attention to how the breath feels as it flows in and out of your nose, you might feel the touch of your breath around your nostrils or on your upper lip, or perhaps you feel the movement of your chest or the rising and falling of your abdomen, or perhaps you feel your whole body like a balloon expanding with the in breath, deflating with the out breath.  So just take some moments to bring your attention to the sensations of breathing in one of these areas, a relaxed attentiveness.  There’s no need to control the breath.  Rather, sense you’re receiving the breath much like you’d listen to sound.  With a relaxed awareness, discover what the breath is really like as a changing experience of sensations.

0 [Narrator] Hey there, I'm John, and welcome to our meditation. If you're having a hard time right now, it's okay, you are not alone and there is help. You can reach out to a loved one, a friend, a colleague or medical resources. If you're suffering from severe depression or having harmful thoughts, please reach out to your local suicide prevention resources. Links are in the description of this video. Go ahead and settle into a position you can comfortably hold for a while. Be gentle with yourself and honor what your body wants. And if you can, try to avoid a position you'd fall asleep in. Noticing your connection to your feet on the floor or your legs on the chair. Allow these to ground you down to the floor where it's still and solid. Place one hand on your heart and one hand on your lower belly. Close your eyes or let them gaze downward towards the floor gently. And inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, into your lower belly. And feeling the hand on your belly move outward as it fills with air. Mother hand on your chest remains gentle and still. Now slowly exhale all of the air out of your body as if you were blowing out candles on a cake. Feeling your belly contract back in. And again breathing deeply into your lower belly, feeling that inhale weaving in and out of your muscles and yourselves, nourishing your body, beginning to allow you to feel lighter, clearer, more still. And as you exhale, allow the breath to gently begin to carry away any sadness and depression or heaviness that you may be feeling. (uplifting music) Continue breathing slowly and deeply into your lower belly. Allowing your focus to remain on the rhythm of your breathing and the sensation of the expansion and contraction of your belly. And if you get distracted that's okay. Just return your attention back to your breath. Using it as your anchor for the rest of our time together, your inhales nourish and lighten you, and they steal you enough to see through the cloudiness and your exhales gently carry the heaviness, pain and negativity away which opens up space for ease and gratitude to come in. (uplifting music) Take some time now to sit with a lot of compassion and love for yourself. Depression can feel overwhelming and takes so much of our energy, but here and now, from this more still grounded space, you can give yourself all of the compassion you deserve and all of the love too. See if you can allow yourself to just be exactly where you are. And when judgment comes up, breathe into it with love and compassion. And let it gently float away, dissipating as it does. And see if you can let yourself become aware of a new feeling of stillness and ease of self love and of hope. (uplifting music) Remember in those times when the heaviness and cloudiness set in, you always have the capacity to return to this space to take care of yourself and love yourself exactly as you are, to wrap yourself in a big hug. There is hope, this will pass and you are not alone. (uplifting music ) Now let's take three more deep breaths together. Take a deep inhale in, holding it for a bit and exhaling it out. Again, an even deeper breath than the one before feeling it weave in and out of your muscles and yourselves. And exhale it out. The last time, your deepest breath yet, this time sending that oxygen through your entire body and when it reaches the top of your head and you're ready, you can open your eyes. (uplifting music)

0 Hello my loves welcome to a guided meditation for self love by Lavendaire I’m happy you made the choice to meditate today and give back to yourself. Let’s get into a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes. Rest your hands on your lap and face your palms up for receiving. Take three deep breaths with an open mouth exhale. Breathe deep into your lungs and your diaphragm, expand…. And then open mouth exhale and let it all out. Repeat two more times… take a deep breath into your belly, and open mouth exhale, and let it all out. Deep breath in….And exhale, let it all out. Take this moment to feel your body and focus on gratitude. What are you grateful for, right now? Feel the energy in your body, a body that works to keep you alive and functioning, without a second thought. A body that supports you and everything you want to do in life. Give this body acknowledgement and love, for all the miraculous things it does for you to keep you here, breathing. Now, focus on your breath for a moment. Isn’t it a wonder that your body knows how to breathe, continuously, without much effort or awareness? But once you shift your awareness to your breath, you become in control of the flow of your breath? Your awareness is powerful. Wherever your attention goes, energy flows. Use the power of your awareness to focus on your body, feeling your presence with each breath. Relax your eyebrows… Relax your brain… relax your shoulders... relax your heart… Relax your entire body.... Feel your body soften and relax. Know that you are safe in this moment. Your body is your shell and your home for this lifetime. Take good care of it. Give it love. Consider: What does self love mean to you? Self love is… accepting yourself, quirks and flaws included. Forgiving yourself, knowing it’s okay to make mistakes. Knowing your worth, standing tall and not feeling small or inferior to others. Loving yourself and your journey, knowing that you are both a work of art and a work in progress at the same time. And all of it is OKAY. Cultivating self love is learning to practice unconditional love for yourself… What does unconditional love mean? How does it feel to love yourself, unconditionally? No conditions.. Meaning: You don’t have to be anything other than yourself. You don’t have to prove yourself to anyone. You are already lovable and loved. You don’t have to try… You are already worthy of love. Feel how it would feel to love yourself, unconditionally… Now we’ll be reciting some positive affirmations to cultivate more self love. Feel free to repeat after me, in your mind. I accept myself exactly as I am. I love and embrace all of me. I am grateful for my body, and all that it’s doing to support me. All of me is beautiful. I am enough. I am worthy. I am a light in this world. My light is unique and incomparable to others. I respect myself and give myself what I need. Setting boundaries is an act of self love. I release all that is holding me back. I release all that does not align with my truest self. I am authentic to who I am and aligned with what I want. I choose love over fear. Come back to your breath. Feel the energy in your body… notice how you feel now, nourishing yourself with love. Remember this feeling, you can always come back to this. Now, we will use the power of visualization. Imagine the energy of love, surrounding you, surrounding your entire body. Feel the warmth of this loving energy envelop and hug your entire body. Love is all around you. Light is all around you. Breathe in… inviting that energy of love & light into you, through the crown of your head. Visualize that energy flow through you, down your entire body, nourishing yourself with unconditional love and light. As you breathe out, release all the negativity and fear that has held you back from pure unconditional love for yourself. Breathe in love… energy in through the top of your head, and breathe out.. Let that beautiful energy flow through you, pushing out all that doesn’t serve you anymore. Where light enters, darkness cannot stay. Continue this visualization as you gently breathe in… and out… breathing in love, and breathing out fear… Resetting and replenishing your energetic body with love and light. Begin to come back to your breath. Check in with your body, and your energy, and notice how you are feeling. You have given yourself so much love today. Continue this practice by nourishing yourself with love and acceptance, every single day. You are fully deserving of love, no matter what. You are already worthy, simply by existing. I hope you take this energy of self love into the rest of your day. The more love you have for yourself, the more love you will put out into the world. And thus, a better, more beautiful world we will create together. Sending you love & light, Namaste.
0 Let's begin by taking a moment to settle your body into a comfortable position (2 seconds).  You may close your eyes or keep them slightly open with a soft focus looking downward a few feet in front of you (2 seconds).  Allow your spine to lift and your shoulders to soften (2 seconds).  Today we will practice a body scan (2 seconds).  Taking a full breath in (2 seconds) and a long slow breath out (2 seconds).  Bring gentle awareness to the breathing (2 seconds).  Notice the in breath (2 seconds)  and out breath (2 seconds)  and spaces in between (10 seconds).  Bring attention to the top of your head, notice sensations or lack of sensations (2 seconds).   Move your attention down to the back of your head, the sides (2 seconds),  to your forehead (2 seconds), and face (5 seconds).  Move your attention to your neck (2 seconds), and your throat (2 seconds), and now shoulders.  Noticing what sensations you are aware of. Shift attention to your arms, upper arms, lower arms (2 seconds),  your hands (2 seconds), and fingers (2 seconds).  Bring your attention to your back, upper back (2 seconds),   down to the middle (2 seconds), and down farther to your lower back (10 seconds).
0 The body is always breathing, and the breath is constantly moving.  Your breath is not only the best place to start; it’s a constant you can return to anytime you need a little centering.  In this practice, you will gently find the breath in the body.  There is nothing to figure out, there are no problems to solve, and there’s nothing special you need to do.  Constantly return to your direct experience of the body breathing.  You are training the mind to be with one experience without distraction.  Find a comfortable position for the body.  Sitting is often recommended, as it helps keep the body awake and energized.  You can also try lying flat on your back, or standing.  You may sit on a yoga mat, meditation cushion, or chair.  Find what feels comfortable and sustainable for a few minutes of stillness.  Gently allow the eyes to close.  If you’re more comfortable with the eyes open, try softly gazing at the floor or ceiling (depending on your position).  Allow the eyes to relax and rest on one spot.  The idea is to minimize distractions in your practice.  Bring your awareness to the abdomen.  Relaxing the muscles there, see if you can feel the natural rising and falling.  Imagine the body is breathing itself.  From the navel around to the obliques, notice the movement with each breath.

you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment [Music] in this gradual process of slowing down you may still have thoughts going through your mind simply notice them and let them move on as you come back to your breath [Music] as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and to slow down allow your body to soften and your breath to be calm if it feels right to you as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up [Music] and as you breathe out this white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of worry [Music] [Music] take a long slow deep breath in through your nose [Music] move this breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to surrender to the weight of gravity and relax as you exhale [Music] breathe out anything that no longer serves you on your journey to simplify [Music] each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even deeper inhale the bright white light exhale let go deeper and deeper allow my voice to be your guide into relaxation you can drift off to sleep when your body is ready [Music] and your subconscious mind will continue listening and relaxing even further like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down in relationship to each breath as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts [Music] invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to

edge and splashing down below notice the momentum of the moving water [Music] below the waterfall the water is flowing into a river the water here moving a little slower yet there is still much momentum carrying the water away this river moves the water into a lake where the water is much calmer and eventually comes to stillness [Music] on the far side of the lake you can see the still water

0 No matter how much you try to think positive thoughts and be optimistic about the future, unpleasant thoughts will still arise.  You cannot avoid them, and there is no use in pretending they aren’t present.  Your mindfulness practice can help you approach these thoughts with curiosity.  As you build an understanding of your unpleasant thinking patterns, they will no longer hook you in so strongly.  You can learn to allow them to be present without letting them consume you.  This exercise is a practice in letting thoughts go so that you are better able to do it when negative thoughts arise.  Close the eyes and tune in to the points of contact in the body.  Feel yourself grounded and stable as you sit.  Breathe deeply, feeling the body supported by the chair or cushion.  Pay attention to the experience in your mind.  Notice any thoughts as they arise, and try to identify any emotions that go with them.
0 So, to reduce anxiety, start by taking a moment to relax your body, soften any unnecessary tension in your belly and shoulder, and find a posture that feels both relaxed and alert,  Rest your hands in an easy effortless way.  With your eyes open, take a few moments to scan your awareness through the sensations of your body, and wherever possible, soften and release obvious areas of physical tension.  Let your eyes stay open and focus on the middle of the room wherever you are.  And then see how you can let your awareness travel across the room from where you’re sitting.  If you’re lying down, you can let your attention go upwards to the ceiling.  And then notice how you can let your attention come back to the center of the room.  And see if you can bring your attention closer, to about book-reading distance as if you’re reading a book in your hands.  So clearly, you can determine where your attention goes.  And now you can let your eyes close and just let your attention go inward.  And gently focus on the sensations of the breath moving in and out of the body...  And you can let your attention go to wherever the breath comes most naturally to you.  For some people, it’s the sensations of the air in the nostrils , with that gentle feeling coming in and out as the air passes in and out at the nostrils.

your problems below as you walk cast a glance down at the small room below see many boxes large and small all of them filled to overflowing with your problems your anxieties and all of your regrets feel a sense of relief as you climb higher moving away from all the chaos the clutter and anxieties below with each step you move towards peace and inner contentment you are now approaching the top step and an inky blackness greets you as you emerge onto a circular Ward platform you note that the sky forms the roof and there are millions of stars twinkling in the black expanse there is a sudden rush of freedom feel the sense of wonder and horror as you look towards the Hamill's [Music] in the middle of the pure-white curved platform there is a circular flat seat sloping back into a contoured chair made out of the same marble as its surroundings sit and feel the coolness of the marble beneath you it is a perfect seat for reflection and you lean back feeling the stone supporting your back in the most perfect places it's as if it was carved with you in mind imagine that you are now looking up at the night sky there are no clouds to mask the Stars and they provide you with a vastness that is appealing a way to escape the tensions of everyday life in real life you may feel tense frustrated and even trapped by life's confinements but as you look up now into the depths of this extraordinary sky dotted with stars millions of stars light-years away you feel a sense of desire to float up high and to become one with the universe to feel weightless to gain a new and inspiring sense of perspective feel yourself begin to float gently out of the marble seat you move up even higher twisting your position around so that you can look around as you float higher you float up above the marble walls and now you can see the view of the city around you lights the twinkle far beneath the expanse of sky the view is magnificent you can see for miles the landscape lit by twinkling lights heralding the existence of those who live and share this reality with you a cityscape that comes to life with the sprinkling of artificial lights that mirror the heavens above you move effortlessly relishing in this feeling of freedom here you are cast afloat from the problems of daily life it is like flying but with no effort required a single thought enables you to change direction at will and you travel on you look down moonlight is reflected in the rippling waters of the estuary gentle waves lap at the shore and as you float out further high above the darkened waters boats Bob along the harbour walls and the feeling here is of complete peace and tranquility you feel invisible there is no blame here no regrets just or at being able to see life from a whole new perspective traveling over the estuary you head along the coastline scaling large cliffs flying high above them thin wispy clouds almost transparent from below are blown in from the sea hugging the cliffs as you move higher the clouds wrap themselves around you like gossamer threads the clouds wispy fragile and translucent follow in your trail as you saw ever higher rising vertically now higher and higher looking up towards the moon silvery gray the moon is for you marvel at its beauty and power knowing how it controls the ebb and wane of the tides he is suddenly life seems less complicated there is a sense of pureness of mystery and yet clarity life is good life is wonderful and you share a sense of connection with the universe breathing deeply and then release the breath letting go of any tension within your body instead focus on the softness of every muscle feel yourself loose relaxed and free from burden far below you low flying birds hug the surface of the water disturbed they seem tiny and fast moving the water ripples gently sparkling stars and the light from the moon Herald your way you see the world from an enlightened viewpoint and it is one of wonder here high above the fragmented clouds you feel a part of the world's mystery connected on every level and free from your problems you can sense a change around you gradually the air becomes warmer and misted as cloud formations begin to forge together the sky changes color dark muted through to light and for a while the Sun and Moon share a place in the heavens he dropped down now through the fluffy clouds thicker now and float down towards the Earth's surface you feel exalted as the see now mirrors the changing skies sparkling sunlight glinting across the surface and shimmers of blue you drift down moving on away from the water's edges still high above the city's architecture tall concrete pillars and homes reaching up towards the sky and small private residences alone surrounded by small patches of green like a complex jigsaw of life stone and irregular shapes all fitting together in an almost seamless ease marvel at how the man-made structures can look beautiful too here you can see that life is about living and not holding on to problems there is no place in your life anymore for anxieties that make you feel ill tension headaches regrets that nor away that cue or the decisions that you just can't make here in this weightless existence you realize that you can be free from all of the negative aspects of life no longer shackled by an existence that holds you back this acknowledgement is meaningful it has the power to change your life as you breathing deeply conjure up the image of those problems and all of the boxes that you left behind initially they were overflowing threatening in their power to hamper your life to impact you at every turn now picture them reduced in size no more threatening just minor inconveniences now that you have scaled them in your mind shrink the problems smaller still breathe deeply again and then out breathing out the last of your connections to those problems and visualize them growing ever smaller minut a fraction of their former size and you realize that your perspective was clouded before your judgement of center your realization of the truth in life and the importance of nature and your place in the world makes those problems seem insignificant by comparison [Music] focus again on your breathing inhaling as you open up the chest exhaling as you breathe out it is time to see the problems of life as mere obstacles it is time to look to the important things in life and to step away from any doubts regrets or anxieties that affect you negatively it is time to feel contentment and to embrace pure inner peace drift gently now down to earth close your eyes and feel your descent you are at peace with life and with yourself finally you understand your part within the universe drifting down bathed in golden light as the Sun shimmers in the early morning sky the faint warmth is comforting a beautiful start to the day it is time to feel positive about your life you have the power to do so you are centered you retain the feeling of peace and wonder you are now back in your own reality imagine that you are back in your bed comfortable safe and secure open your eyes and stretch out your muscles breathing deeply to send oxygen around your body realize how good you feel right now keep experiencing the wonderful sense of calmness and deep peace as you remember your wonderful high time above the clouds a part of the midnight sky and then a part of the early morning transition as night became day understand now that your problems are such a small part of time and space and even within your own reality understand that your problems can be dealt with quickly and clearly with clarity of mind breathing deeply and keep your sense of peace and tranquility breathe out slowly noting that no tension remains remember that you can return to this meditation whenever you need a renewed perspective you are one with the universe [Music]
0 welcome to a guided meditation for anxiety and depression on the clutter of the mind so let's start the practice by finding our seat you can sit on a chair or cushion on the floor [Music] and sit with your back upright but comfortable so before getting into the practice let's just start by acknowledging how we feel in this moment and we don't need to add a story to the way we are feeling we don't need to judge it or try to change it right now just be with it part of suffering is that we suffer that we suffer so we add thoughts or stories that only worsen what we're feeling mindfulness is an open awareness and acceptance of what we're experiencing in the moment whether it's good or bad so let's start here with acknowledgement and now let's start by taking in a few big deep breaths breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth and now close your eyes let's place our attention now on the breath start by noticing each inhale and exhale the sensations around each breath and where you notice the most maybe you notice the rising sensations in the chest or stomach maybe you notice the falling sensations around the body on each exhale and just be with the sensations follow the rhythm of each in breath and out breath with your full attention and as we do this thoughts may arise feelings may surface and this is part of the practice if you are experiencing anxiety and a bout of depression right now there will likely be thoughts and feelings that attempt to pull your attention away and when this happens notice it instead of resisting or changing it see if you can actually play with these thoughts and feelings here see if you can become welcoming of them and allow them to come and go before returning to watching the breath and if you find yourself following a thought or feeling with more thoughts or adding a story to them gently pull your attention back to the breath watching the sensations of breathing and as you watch the breath and continue to notice thoughts see if you can use the out breath to release any discomfort to release any unwelcome thoughts sending them out with the exhale so for the just that moment even if it's very brief the mind is empty and allow any feelings that come up to be acknowledged and sent out with the breath as well so that even for a brief moment you are emotionally still and quiet see if you can find those moments where just for a brief micro second you are without any anxiety or feelings of depression and when you get a glimpse of it it's tempting to seek it but we're not fabricating anything here or seeking it just allow these moments to come to you through mindfulness through watching the breath and resting in awareness and now let's shift our attention from the breath into the physical notice the contact that your body is making your feet on the floor your body against the chair your hands in the lap and notice your weight on the chair or on the floor as well and just be with the physical sensations for the next few moments and now in the final few moments of the practice just let go allow the mind to do what it wants and go where it wants and now open your eyes thanks for having the courage and will today to do this mindfulness practice and i'll see you next time

0 when it feels like everything is out of your control seek to connect with what you do have control over your breath and your response to your experience in times of uncertainty anxiety worry and fear are often heightened these strong emotions are a signal a reminder for you to deepen your connection with yourself you can choose to see these uncertain times as an opportunity to slow down practice inner reflection and look for the positive growth that will come out of the challenges that we are all collectively facing while it feels as though we are each going through this in isolation you are not alone even this meditation others all over the world are practicing with you and supporting you on your journey as you are doing for them as well and I am here to support you as I am writing and recording this meditation I am thinking of each and every one of you and sending you positive healing energy if you are new here I'm Sarah Raymond and if you are returning welcome back here at the mindful movement we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing today let go of fear and worry know that you are safe and you can choose to cultivate more peace and joy I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes if you'd like or simply soften your gaze invite your attention to shift away from the sights smells and sounds around you and begin to bring your focus inward while it may feel like you want to escape reality when things get difficult now is your invitation to make a deeper connection with yourself and with the collective energy of the world become aware of where your body makes contact with the surface below you let this connection ground you feel this as support and allow yourself to be fully supported you are safe you can trust in the universe  use this sensation of where you and your support meet to draw your awareness gradually from your outer experience to your inner world  notice without judgment what your physical sensations are in this moment your body has the amazing ability to cope with challenges and grow stronger from them if you allow and let go of resistance it is okay to befriend the fear that shows up for you fear is not the enemy it is a helpful and necessary emotion when it is channeled correctly meet whatever you're experiencing with love  allow your relaxed awareness now to move to the sensations of your hands notice your hands as they are in this moment what sensations are they are now do you sense tingling or buzzing  are you aware of the temperature of your hands  now make tight fists with both hands clenching and gripping tightly take a deep breath in hold it for a moment and as you exhale as slowly as you can release your hands completely letting go letting go letting go do this again make a tight fist with both hands hold it tight take a deep breath in hold for a moment and again exhale as slowly as you can and release your hands release the gripping letting go throughout your entire body feel how this relaxation moves throughout your entire body as you let go of the gripping in your hands  take a moment to enjoy this ease connect with this relaxed state  while there are many things in life that you don't have control over your breath is one aspect that you can direct a bit to continue relaxing and letting go even deeper invite your exhales to lengthen now if it feels right to you start to count the length of your next inhale and encourage your exhale to be twice as long perhaps you begin with a two count inhale and a four count exhale and as you continue lengthening each exhale and counting your breath you may move to a three and six count follow the lead of your breath breathing in this way for a few more cycles allow your breath to be easy and relaxing continuing to let go of gripping and let go of the need to try too hard  consider the times in life when releasing and letting go gives way to growth trees must let go of leaves in the fall to have the opportunity for new growth in the spring waves in the ocean flow in to the shore and back out again creating a natural ebb and flow [Music] many animals must shed their skin or outer layer in order to grow  as humans we have a period of exhalation to make room for the next inhalation there must be an in period as well as an out period receiving and letting go consider the times when resistance creates more difficulty  for example the spinning wheels of a car in mud the more you try to get out the deeper the wheels dig into the mud  take a moment now to scan through your body can you find any areas where you are holding on breathe into those areas and then let go [Music] perhaps you may be holding on at the area of your stomach can you let go here can you open the flow of energy within you continue to connect with relaxation as deeply as you can practice surrendering practice letting go open to the healing energy within you continue this on your own for the next few moments in silence and I will check back with you soon  when your mind wanders come back to your body come back to your powerful healing energy are you able to relax even more connect even deeper with yourself [Music] listen to your heart surrender to your inner wisdom again become aware of the place where your body meets the support below you sense this connection since the support in times of challenge and uncertainty we can support one another the benefit of your meditation practice and your connection to your inner wisdom will benefit your loved ones neighbors community and the collective energy of the universe we are all in this together and will grow stronger from this time as it draws us closer to one another look through the dark night to see the light trust in the universe  feel the love surrounding you have faith that this will pass take a deep breath in once more and let it out slowly release peace and healing energy out into the world and know that others are doing the same to support you connect with the knowledge that you have the ability and strength to handle whatever comes your way let's take one more deep breath in together and as you let it go slowly open your eyes I am truly grateful and honored to have this opportunity to practice with you may you be well may you be safe and may you live with peace

relax do your best to let go of any expectations of what you think you might sense and simply feel what is there without judgement as you continue to notice the sensations around your head face throat and neck try to connect directly to what you are feeling rather than using your eyes to scan the body the eyes can create tension internally try to sense the feelings from within your body do you feel tingling heat tightness tension or relaxation you might feel a sensation of floating lightness or heaviness you may sense that there is no difference between where you end and where the energy around you begins it is all connected it is all one whatever you're feeling is okay simply observe the sensations as they are and invite in a sense of ease in your body you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part allows it to relax and let go continue moving the scan of your body downward all the way to your feet and stay with the sensations and the relaxation process as you slowly scan your body fully notice any areas that might still be holding on to any lingering tension and ask your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe and supported and knows what to do to relax your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you or needs your immediate attention all you need to do is follow the sound of my voice as a guide and allow yourself to relax experience and embrace the feelings of unconditional love for yourself being fully present to this moment to your physical body to the sounds around you and the surface below you set the intention for peace and relaxation for your physical body for you mentally and spiritually your mind may naturally drift off into thoughts and that is okay you do not need to completely shut off your mind and empty it of all thoughts when you do recognize that your mind is drifting acknowledge your thoughts without following those thoughts into a drawn-out story you can choose to visualize the thoughts drifting off into the distance like a cloud floating by and then come back to your breath to ground you and bring you into the present moment once more the breath is your place to be fully present the breath gives you the opportunity to pause if your attention shifts to focus on a sensation or emotion allow it to move away from your breath for a moment to notice what's coming up in your physical body again without judgment and without getting caught up in thinking stories intend to allow the sensations or emotions as they are if your attention begins to drift simply come back to your breath as your anchor to ground you in this present moment and now begin to bring your awareness back to this present moment back to the surface below you and when you are ready take a deep breath and then sigh it out breathe out any remaining stress frustration tension and distraction from within you don't be afraid to make a sound take another deep breath and allow your exhale to flow out of you cleansing and healing your body and mind like a warm wave of energy do this again and notice how you become increasingly more relaxed yet energized and focused at the same time feel yourself becoming present anchored and grounded in the simple practice of breathing deeply and when you are ready open your eyes knowing you are calm and focused to go on with your day
0 now I invite you to find comfort  choose a position either seated or lying down with your spine straight begin by closing your eyes to heighten your awareness of this present moment through the senses other than sight  explore and connect with the space around you using your senses  allow yourself to settle in to this space noticing how you relate to the room around you  notice the air in the room since the temperature of the air as it gently contacts your skin does the air around you feel humid or dry is there a distinct smell in the room and now listen for any sounds within this room  perhaps you hear the word of a fan or air conditioning unit  sounds are vibrations and can sometimes be felt within your body look inward and feel the sounds and growing your field of consciousness now to look for any distant sounds you may be able to hear without straining listen to the sound that is the farthest that you can hear  letting your awareness shift inward to your body now  and how it interacts with your surroundings  notice the feel of the fabric of your clothes on your body  since the constant pull of gravity anchoring you into the surface beneath you now allow your relaxed awareness to rest on your breath without manipulation without judgment be the observer of your natural automatic breath be here now as an observer and witness as your body is being breathed there is no right or wrong no good or bad you are exactly where you need to be this body  this moment this breath nothing has ever happened in the past and nothing will ever happen in the future life always takes place in this present moment our lives are a series of present moment experiences what is there for you in the experience of this moment lean into this moment say yes to this moment with your breath allow it to be the perfect moment that it is  slowly allow your breath to deepen inviting your spine to lengthen as you inhale without effort or force guide your breath to be deep in both location and volume  listen to the sound your inhale makes  inhale with an intention an intention to fully accept this moment as it arrives when we want the moment to be different than it is we create an internal conflict a fight with reality when we accept the moment for what it is we can add peace and ease to our moments knowing wholeheartedly they are as they should be  we are on our journey always at the right place always at the right time  now let your breath soften to a natural rhythm continuing to inhale with this intention of presence and as you exhale allow yourself to let go let go of areas of tension in your body perhaps around your eyes and jaw  softening your neck and shoulders let go of negativity from the past let go of the worry of what's to come to be here in this present moment give yourself permission to let go of the to-do lists the shoulds and the students allow yourself to rest your awareness on the right now this inhale this exhale  this gift of breath you have right now for the next few moments of silence I invite you to continue to practice being with your breath as the observer  watch the path of each inhale and exhale listen and feel your breath fully as it shows up for you right now  observe yourself experiencing this present moment  allow your breath to slowly deepen again invite your awareness back to the surface noticing the sounds in the room again perhaps since any difference of how you feel now from when you began this meditation and when you are ready makes some very small movements with your body maybe rubbing your thumb and finger together or perhaps wiggling your toes and begin to let a little light into your eyes and now take one more deep breath opening your eyes and smiling in gratitude for taking this time for yourself thank you for practicing with me today
0 first let me offer my sincere congratulations to you for taking this important first step in your meditation practice the fact that you are hearing this recording means you have decided to make time for yourself to turn the lens of your vision inward when we are more often looking outward frequently not knowing the right way to meditate or the possibility of not doing it perfectly may be discouraging when beginning a practice in reality meditation is not a destination it is a journey it is not about the outcome it is about the process about the curiosity you bring to what is there for you right now there is no wrong way to do it this is why we refer to it as a meditation practice not a meditation perfect for today's practice we will follow three stages and if you decide to continue to practice on your own you can follow these stages or come back to this recording as a guide as frequently as you like you can follow these three stages for five minutes or an hour or any time you decide simply show up with a positive and open mind and now let's begin I invite you to find a posture that allows you to be alert and awake yet still unrelaxed perhaps close your eyes or soften your gaze on a fixed point and let the background blur [Music] without expectations of what you think you will find observe your breath in its natural state without changing or judging the first stage of today's meditation is to focus on one thing and that will be your breath [Music] the next stage is to focus on nothing in particular with the intention to go back to the first stage of focus if you find your mind wandering and the third stage is to let go into blissful peace and simply be these stages do not need to be linear and you can move from one to the other and back again sometimes practicing will be comfortable and come easily and other times it may be difficult and uncomfortable emotions can arise your meditation practice parallels life in this way the practice is about the journey not the destination begin to notice any sensations you experience on each inhale [Music] maybe you feel the air passed through your nostrils can you sense the path your breath travels once inside your body [Music] [Music] what subtle changes do you experience with each breath in notice your chest and back rise and expand with each inhale do you feel invigorated with each inhale and now what do you notice about your natural exhale do you sense a softening as your breath is expelled what does your breath sound like perhaps you feel that the air is slightly warmer with your exhale than it is on your inhale notice your chest and back sink and soften with each exhale notice your own natural pattern as it comes and goes do you feel a subtle relaxation as you exhale each time [Music] and now for the next few breaths since the natural pause between each part of your breath there is a moment after you inhale and before you begin your next exhale where you can bring your attention to rest [Music] continuing to focus on your breath a little longer begin to create an equal part breath starting to count the length of your inhale and match the length with your exhale you may find that as you practice this equal part breath the lengths and depth of your breath extends whatever you notice is okay perhaps explore what it would be like to start your inhale from low in your belly then fill up your ribs and chest then all the way up to your throat and then exhale fully for the same length as your inhale practice this equal count breath for several more cycles until your focus naturally releases the counting to focus on nothing in particular then you will practice being in quiet stillness if your mind wanders off into thought or story or you notice a noise or distraction simply bring your attention back to your counting and the equal part breath until you are ready once more to focus on nothing specific and let go into bliss enjoy this practice for a few moments longer and I will bring your attention back when it's time this is a practice it is natural to lose focus so be kind to yourself and keep coming back continue to start over when you need without judging it is time now to begin the journey to looking outward once more take your time deepen your breath again bring some gentle movements to your fingers and toes and welcome in refreshing energy throughout your body as your field of consciousness grows out from your Center bring some light and color into your eyes from your surroundings at first notice this space where part of you is still looking inward as another part of you is beginning to look outward again how long can this experience last throughout your day are you able to metaphorically continue to have one eye looking inward as the other is looking outward thank you for practicing with me today remember meditation like learning any other skill takes practice perseverance and patience keep showing up keep practicing

0 thank you for joining me for this guided meditation to help you relax into the resistance the saying goes what you resist persists if you stop and think about how this applies to your life you may find that this is true for both your physical experience as well as your emotional state the lesson is to trust the experience accept what is with respect of the journey and simply allow letting go of worry expectations and the need to be in complete control at all times is the way past resistance being mindful is the practice of noticing and allowing the experience without judgment as we begin to settle into our meditation practice they invite you to make yourself comfortable sit or lie down in a way that allows you to find ease in a position where you feel safe to be supported by the surface below you so you can completely let go of the need to hold yourself up or to control your posture this intentional choice is sending your brain a message that you are ready to relax into the flow of this practice and the flow of the energy of life begin to make any small subtle adjustments to your body to welcome the relaxed peaceful state to wash over your entire physical body and your consciousness as you are beginning to surrender into the calm bring your attention to the natural rhythm of your breath your body and your brain are always working together to breathe so you don't have to constantly be thinking about it however the simple act of mindfully attending to your breath deepening your breath and being intentional about it sends a message that it is okay to relax now is the time for inviting ease into your body take an intentionally slow and deep breath and take another one take your time filling up as much as you can and slow down your exhale as well be patient with your breath feel as your next breath happens to you easily and effortlessly perhaps deepening and slowing down your natural rhythm and now simply allow your breath to continue on its own relax into your breath let it be as your breath finds an easy natural flow move your attention to your physical body the intention as you scan your body is loving compassionate allowing of what is it is all part of who you are send an invitation to release what does not serve you slowly bring your awareness to your toes since this area without judgments or expectations what do you notice [Music] what would it be like to relax this area your intention to bring your awareness to a specific part of your body gives it permission to relax by simply noticing you can find ease moving your attention slowly up your body as you sense the soles of your feet you are ankles your calves and your knees if there is any area of your body that is speaking to you keep your attention there a little longer breathe into that area invite a release allow whatever you're feeling to be what it is and to pass through you rather than pushing it down no need to label what you are sensing simply experience it and allow it to release and relax take as long as you need attending to each part of your body perhaps you are ready to move your attention up to your thighs your hips your abdomen and low back our physical body holds on to emotions and can be resistant to letting go by attending to the sensations as they arise breathing into what you experience and patiently allowing they will pass through you then you will bring ease and comfort into your body what would it feel like to release the pain and discomfort from your body relax into the resistance now move your attention to your ribs your chest and your heart open your heart open the energy of your heart with loving-kindness and compassion for yourself and others this is a safe place to let down the protective wall that has perhaps been surrounding your heart what would it be like to open your heart to give your love and energy freely and to be open to receive it back if this brings up sensations or a shift in emotions come back to the intention of loving compassionate allowing of what is let it be  release what does not serve you moving your attention to your shoulders your arms your hands  and fingers continue to relax each body part as your attention washes over it  since now the area of your neck and throat can you let go of any tightness holding or guarding can you find more space for the energy to flow freely here what would it be like for this area to be open giving and receiving of energy like the area of your heart sensing the release of your jaw cheeks eyes forehead and scalp  take one more patient scan of your body to welcome a little more love compassion and relaxation to any areas that may still need it it is all part of what makes you unique let it be allow it now that your body is relaxed and you have let go of any tightness or tension in your physical body I will guide you to explore your emotions mindfully know that you are in a safe space and you can open your eyes and stop at any time if you feel the need to do so consider something in your life where you may be experiencing resistance simply recognize the emotions arising that surround this experience whatever you're feeling is okay it is safe to be vulnerable right now during your practice during meditation there is no guilt or judgments there is no right or wrong perhaps there is something you have been denying for some time know that whatever it is that you are resisting is simply an obstacle on your path it is part of your journey these moments are opportunities for learning and growth because this may be a negative or challenging emotion do your best to let down your guard let down your armor to what you are feeling as it is make space for awareness and acceptance without judgment this experience these emotions are part of you and they are okay simply allow know that Worry has not solved any problems or prevented any disasters worried brings unnecessary suffering and takes away from experiencing the present moment to the fullest resistance brings your energy to what you do not want rather than what you do want what would it be like to trust the situation and allow as you continue to explore see deeply into the situation are there any recurring thoughts images beliefs or stories associated with this resistance know that you are enough trust and allow the experience with love and compassion for yourself and others for the next few moments continue relaxing into the resistance with patience breathe into it  let it be slowly bring your attention back to your physical body back to the surface below you bring some gentle movements to your body to re-energize you as you are slowly coming out of the state of relaxation know that you can patiently continue to relax into the resistance whether physical or emotional come back to this meditation practice as often as you need trust you are enough allow mindfully and know that the experience itself is not you let go and rest in awareness itself things are just as they are when you are ready open your eyes with love and compassion for yourself

0 I am grateful you have chosen me to be your guide today please subscribe to this channel for more guided meditations each week and consider sharing with anyone you think can find value from these videos and now I invite you to make yourself comfortable make any large shifts in your position to find a resting place of ease take your time make any small and subtle adjustments to your body to fully relax perhaps releasing your facial expressions from around your eyes and your mouth allow all the tiny muscles in your face and jaw to soften and let go settle into ease allow the settling to flow into your mind as well you it takes time and patience to quiet the busy mind just like stretching a muscle requires relaxation to let the muscle lengthen the mind requires relaxation to slow down to make space you today we will intentionally attend to our breath to bring about the relaxation response to help let go of stress to let go of any negativity that you may be holding on to to let go of the need for perfection and control and to let go of anything else that may be limiting you now I invite you to breathe in deeply through your nose and breathe out through your mouth with a relaxed jaw making a sigh noise continue breathing deeply for a few cycles while observing your breath as soon as all of your air is released allow your next breath in begin to notice the moment when your exhale flows right into your inhale and then when your inhale becomes your next exhale and on and on the flow goes like an ocean wave coming into Shore and rolling back out again you may notice that your breath has returned to its natural rhythm we're not controlled the breath has an automated tempo and depth feel the sensation of being breathed receiving the breath into your body there is a force greater than us working to send breath into our bodies and it is our job to allow it to invite in the breath we can only control our breath for so long before it returns to automation the same is true in life you now moving your attention to each exhale to breathe out is to let go of air to let go of energy to surrender to the natural rhythm of breath for the next few breaths focus on each exhale has a time to let go perhaps on your next breath in make fists with your hands and squeeze them tightly and as you exhale literally let go of the tension release your grip let go of anything you're holding on to as you breathe out and feel the sensation ripple through the rest of your body and with each subsequent exhale let go of what you no longer need it may be pain it may be anger it may be heartbreak or it maybe control whatever it is for you simply let it go let go of tension let go of any heaviness weighing on you [Music] [Music] continue to attend to your natural breath rhythm mindfully [Music] observing all you can about your breath our breath is always with us and by using it as a focal point we become present we cannot get back to a past breath and we cannot breathe a future breath the only breath we have is this one in the present moment by using breath as a focal point as part of our meditation practice we develop the conditioning to know that at anytime we need we can simply shift our focus to our breath perhaps during a stressful interaction with a loved one while stuck in traffic or as anxiety builds there is no need to bring out the meditation cushion in order to practice being mindful we can simply and mindfully breathe and as we have practiced today our breath has the ability to bring about the familiar state of relaxation and calm [Music] you [Music] with practice you will find that perhaps this conditioned relaxation becomes your reflexive response showing up naturally and quickly [Music] breathing naturally brings oxygen to your blood into your brain to bring about the feeling of safety and with this feeling of safety comes the relaxation response just like an intentional smile bring the sensations of happiness mindful breathing bring the sensations of calm to the mind and body stress and relaxation cannot exist together much like the way light cancels out darkness inviting relaxation into the body can cancel out any remaining stress or tension your breath will bring a sensation of release to each part of your body and now imagine breathing into your shoulders and neck since the natural movement in this area that is connected to your breath rhythm like an ocean wave can invite the sensation to move down from your shoulders through your arms and hands visualize the movement of your breath pulsing through each arm and hand to relax fully and by your breath to fill your chest ribs and abdomen making space for energy to flow freely open your heart with a sense of lightning and then soften your belly peel from the inside the flowing quality of your breath as it travels the length of your body see the breath now moving down into your hips and legs relax your ankles and feet with each wave of breath and since the breath now in the soles of the feet sense the breath going to every cell in your body healing with life's energy stay with your breath and the sensations that come along with it for the next few moments of silence begin now to activate the muscles in your face and around your eyes with an intentional joyful smile feel the smile wash over your face and notice what a simple smile can do for how you are feeling continue to smile for a few more moments feeling the sense of joy building inside you and when you are ready begin to bring some gentle movements to your fingers and your toes moving the energy through your limbs and when you are ready open your eyes knowing that you can always come back to your breath mindfully thank you so much for listening I hope you have a beautiful day

energy to those parts stay with the sensations a short while longer and reflect on the amazing ability and automatic functions of your body send gratitude and vitality to each and every part of your body your heart and your soul invite your attention to rest on your breath as it flows in its natural rhythm now notice its path its tempo and its fullness perhaps your breath is beginning to slow down and deepen as you relax or maybe you feel your breath has become shallow or even pauses momentarily whatever you're experiencing is perfect simply be with the sensations as they arise feel the sensations of being breathed receiving the breath into your body filling you up restoring your energetic balance and sense of calm to breathe in is to fill up with air to fill up with healing life-giving energy focus on your inhale for the next few breaths like a pitcher being filled up with water from the bottom to the top this is our ability to nourish and heal ourselves there is a force greater than us working to send breath into our bodies and it is our job to allow it to invite in the breath we need to both breathe in to fill up as well as to breathe out to let go in order to be balanced to breathe out is to let go of air to let go of energy to surrender to the natural rhythm of breath you can let go to make room for nourishing energy to fill you up consider each breath out as a time for releasing any unwanted energies and developing the energy you do desire this is your time to heal and let go life nature and every energetic being experiences a natural ebb and flow an inhalation period as well as an exhalation period and life is the balance of expending energy and restoring energy a balance of growth and rest for the next few breaths focus on each exhale as a time to let go [Music] the more connected to your body and aware you become the more you see that your body speaks your mind and it speaks important messages if you are willing and open to listen today practice loving and listening to your body invite in a deep nourishing breath filling up with rejuvenating energy and breathe out fully letting go since the positive sensations in your body the alive

0 lao-tzu once said nature does not hurry yet everything is accomplished just as the way water patiently erodes the surface of Iraq we too can soften over time when we follow the path of least resistance and let go of our struggles we add unnecessary suffering to our experience when we want our reality to be something other than what it really is with patience for the process we can release our resistance accept what is and we can experience peace letting go of resistance and experiencing acceptance is an ongoing practice it is one that can be especially difficult yet extremely useful during challenging and uncertain times slowing down and discovering patience during meditation is like training for our day-to-day life experiences enjoy the process be patient allow yourself to learn and grow and trust the journey hello and welcome I'm Sarah Raymond thank you for joining me today let's begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes gently and take a patient deep breath in and as you breathe out allow your body to soften in a moment I will guide you in a four seven eight breath pattern then you can continue the same pattern on your own you will breathe in through your nose for the count of four then hold for a count of seven if you can or shorter if you need then breathe out through your mouth for the count of eight and now to begin breathe out completely now breathe in two three four hold two three four five six seven breathe out two three four five six seven eight and one more cycle together breathe in two three four hold two three four five six seven breathe out two three four five six seven eight and now continue this pattern on your own for a few more cycles [Music] [Music] allow your breath to return to its natural pattern and let go of the Counting [Music] take a moment to simply notice how you are feeling after practicing a few deliberate relaxing breaths [Music] invite your attention to effortlessly drift around your physical sensations to notice your current state observe the quality of the state you're in without making any changes or judging where you are simply check-in are you calm what is your heart rate like at this moment what are the sensations you are experiencing in your body are you warm or cool what else is your attention drawn to as the observer of your natural state [Music] what can you patiently discover about yourself as you look inward on your experience [Music] [Music] now that you have observed your unchanged experience scan through your body once more look for anywhere you can let go the tendency to hold on is there anywhere in your physical body that you can let go let go of tension let go of tightness or pain there may be areas that are holding on that you weren't even aware of until you patiently looked inward today right now I invite you to welcome more ease into your body [Music] what would it feel like in your body to slow down and discover peace [Music] [Music] what would it feel like to experience calm to be still [Music] breathe this in experience this right now this stillness this calm state is a time to go within [Music] life nature and every person experiences a natural ebb and flow of energy an inhalation period as well as an exhalation period [Music] life is the balance of giving and receiving of expending energy and conserving energy it is up to you to discover patience and Trust this journey [Music] as humans energetically we can learn from the rhythms of nature each of the seasons has its own energy and symbolism that indicates where nature is in its yearly cycle you can learn from the seasons and their energetic changes to help you move through your own seasonal cycle and energetic shift each season has meaning and can invite contemplation of the connections of nature to your own experiences fall is a time of letting go of what no longer serves you letting go so you can welcome in change and new beginnings winter can be a time of stillness to go within perhaps planning for the future and nurturing what is important to you and after the cold dark time of winter spring brings a sense that your soul is rested and at the same time spring carries the promise of renewal like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon [Music] summer is bursting with light and growth and freedom [Music] these symbols of nature's seasons may relate to different seasons of your life the reminder is that everything changes and goes through stages no matter the season that you are experiencing now consider the energy of the seasons as you contemplate this cycle in nature as well as your own life what is your experience can you discover the patience of nature and use it to cultivate the same patience within yourself what would it be like to allow yourself to slow down let go of resistance and Trust the journey [Music] [Music] fall can be a reminder for you to acknowledge and accept the impermanence and brief nature of things winter encourages you to go within and conserve your energy while spring and summer offer the beauty of new growth the warmer months are a reminder to appreciate all of the beauty that surrounds us in this world tomorrow is not guaranteed and we have the opportunity to enjoy this moment and live every day to the fullest [Music] the lessons and energy from each season can change your mood it can change your perspectives and therefore your choices nature is a reminder to recognize that all things change all things are beautiful and perfect in their own unique way at just the right time nature doesn't rush its process all changes happen seasons change and everything gets accomplished without worry [Music] bring your awareness to the sensations and energy of your body once more take a patient deep breath in and let it out as slowly as you can since a building of energy within you know that like nature the Sun shines the light on what we may not have seen before you have taken the

0 welcome to the short morning meditation for allowing abundance we also have a longer version of this meditation that can also be used before bed for more powerful effect the mindset of abundance is the opposite of scarcity abundance is the overflowing and over sufficient quantity of that which you desire and you have the power to invite it into your life you have the choice to change the way you look at things take the next few minutes with this meditation to prepare your mindset for the day ahead and watch as abundance flows easily into your life as we begin allow your eyes to close gently and focus your attention on your breath by simply being mindful and intentional with your breath your body sends a signal to your brain that you are safe and can relax and focus on what's important taken five deep intentional and relaxing breaths invite in a sense of comfort and relaxation with each breath in breathe into the heart and expand the capacity of this space with each breath out let go of tension let go of distractions let go of the need to control your thoughts [Music] allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and flow and as you continue to relax I will guide you on a journey this journey will take you on a path to release any negative beliefs or ideas that could be holding you back from the abundance you desire then you will bring in the energy of abundance into the space you create for it when you let go of fears I invite you now to open your imagination and step into a field of beautiful wildflowers look around you as you stand on a path that leads you right down the center of the field here you are surrounded on both sides by flowers and the most vivid colors use your senses to take in this beautiful and peaceful environment around you see the clear bright sky above you feel that the temperature of the air is perfect for you and the Sun shines on you gently warming your skin the faint smell of the flowers is just right for your liking perhaps you hear birds chirping in a distance or see butterflies flitting around as you look around you can see many beautiful colors in all directions around you you sense that you are safe and peaceful in this place in your imagination you begin to walk along this path down the center of the field moving towards some rolling hills of even more wildflowers [Music] as you walk you have a feeling that you are carrying around something extra something weighing you down making you feel heavy and tired you reach into your pockets and feel that surprisingly there are some smooth stones these stones that you are carrying around weighing you down represent your fears and your feelings of not enough they represent anything known or unknown to you that is holding you back each stone is something that is blocking the flow of abundance to you slowly take one stone out of your pocket and leave it on the path behind you as you continue walking slowly feel a space open up inside of you as you let go of something negative in your life there's no need to label what you're letting go of simply let go knowing it is something that is no longer supporting your goals and desires for abundance continue to do the same with each of the remaining stones in your pocket one at a time take your time and feel the energetic shift feel the space you have opened up for flow [Music] now that you have let go of that which no longer serves you and you have made room for the flow of abundance invite it in letting go of resistance gives way to an attitude of allowing allow in positive energy thoughts and beliefs allow ingratitude love and abundance feel this flow of positive energy within you and it is magnetically attracted back to you take a moment and sense this energy and positive feeling as you look around at the field of flowers now you can see possibilities and abundance everywhere you look each of the flowers around you grew from a seed each seed had everything it needed within to become the flower that it is and each flower has the seeds to become many more flowers and on and on the cycle goes much like these flowers have grown from seeds you to have everything you need within you to have the life of your dreams and to attract the abundance in your life that you desire the abundance of flowers around you represent abundance in your life [Music] now call to mind what part of your life you would like to see a flow of abundance visualize this component of your life exactly as you want it to be and feel how it would feel as if this is already true soak in the feelings in this present moment [Music] [Music] the things you think about at the beginning of your day color your thoughts for the day ahead in a moment I will guide you with some positive affirmation statements inviting the flow of abundance into your life you can simply listen and feel the statements or you can repeat them if you choose I acknowledge the positive things in my life I express the feeling of gratitude often for the blessings in my life I love myself and believe I am worthy of abundance to flow to me I allow the flow of abundance in all aspects of my life I attract success and abundance I radiate positive loving energy and that is what comes back to me I take action towards my goals of abundance every day I let go of negative influences and energy that do not serve me I know that abundance is unlimited and that my abundance will benefit others I am generous and give my unique gifts to the world and now you have prepared your mind for the day ahead to see the world with gratitude and to allow the flow of abundance to you [Music] as you go about your day you will continue to radiate out love and positive energy as you attract it back to you now begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment back to the surface below you deepen your breath again and invite in a building sense of energy to start your day and when you're ready open your eyes

0 I have a guided meditation to help you relax this practice is great for putting a pause on a stressful experience or negative emotions and simply connecting inward and now let's begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable choosing any position that allows you to feel fully supported where you can relax and let go [Music] choose a position that you know you are safe and gives you the opportunity to [Music] focus inward [Music] perhaps close your eyes if you like [Music] and begin to settle in [Music] make any small subtle adjustments to your posture patiently think deeper into comfort take your time there's no rush here you set aside this time where no one needs anything from you or no responsibilities for the next little while [Music] let this be a pleasure for you to enjoy [Music] and as you settle into comfort allow your attention to rest at the sensations of your hands [Music] notice the palms of your hands [Music] and since the tops of your hands [Music] and notice all the way to the very tips of your fingers [Music] and since both hands as a whole [Music] notice if there's a temperature around the area of your hands do you sense energy perhaps buzzing or a vibration or tingling [Music] whatever you are feeling it's just right [Music] this practice is simply about looking for what's there recognizing your true experience in this present moment [Music] can you sense a feeling of weight at the area of your hands maybe your hands feel very heavy and solid into the surface below you or perhaps I feel light as if they could float off the surface below you and drift into the air [Music] notice if there's a color around the area of your hands that can be sensed [Music] and now with a relaxed awareness welcome your attention to rest on your feet notice the tops of your feet and ankles [Music] notice your toes [Music] and the soles of your feet [Music] is there a temperature you are aware of at the area of your feet [Music] is it warm or cool [Music] or simply neutral are you able to sense heavy or light at the area of your feet [Music] perhaps you notice a color when your attention rests at the area of your feet [Music] is there an energetic quality at the area of your feet [Music] allowing your attention to continue to stay here at the area of your feet [Music] imagine bringing in energy from the earth from all around you [Music] imagine bringing in this energy from the soles of your feet as if they were permeable [Music] the energy moves in from the soles of your feet and it intuitively moves to wherever your body needs it [Music] your body and this energy coming in from the outside flow as if dancing together [Music] creating a beautiful flow of energy filling you up [Music] where you maybe depleted [Music] moving excess energy where there may be a buildup since this energy swirling around you flowing throughout your entire body [Music] letting go of excess energy through the crown of your head and drawing in energy to refill you from the soles of your feet [Music] perhaps you can sense this energy [Music] like a warm embrace from a loved one or perhaps it feels like the weight of a heavy warm blanket [Music] stay with this flow of energy [Music] for just a little longer allowing your body to connect with the energy [Music] so that the energy knows where to go [Music] now sensing the areas of your hands and your feet once more bringing some gentle movements to those areas feeling the energy building up at your hands and your feet once more and take a moment as we close the practice to connect with that perfect level of energy feel it in your body like muscle memory know that you have the ability to come back to this moment this sensation any time you need it is already within you your body knows how to find balance it may just need a little loving attention and encouragement when it feels right to you open your eyes I hope you have a wonderful day thank you so much for practicing with me I'd love to hear how your practice went share in the comments below and I look forward to practicing with you again

sound of my voice as it layers with the other sounds around you practice observation without judgment simply notice listen to the layers of the sounds around you how the energy of sounds coexist and mingle together [Music] perhaps even feel the sounds in your body as vibrations this practice is not about what you find but that you are observing in the present moment without judgment without the

pause this cherished and blissful connection to yourself [Music] find peace in the stillness the stillness between breaths and between thoughts the stillness of simply being no need to change or force anything simply be [Music] [Music] allow your outward attention to soften as you turn your listening inward to contemplate what your physical body is experiencing right now [Music] narrow your field of awareness a bit more as you notice the air as it gently touches your skin feel the fabric of your clothes as it meets your body since the weight of your body as it makes contact with the surface below you [Music] now softly scan your body from within allow yourself to feel your body as it is without judgment allow it to be just as it is in this moment allow the good the softness allow the

allowing your awareness to flow throughout your body from the inside noticing what's there for you now [Music] perhaps you may experience a softening of tension as your focus flows over each part of your body you may notice your jaw and allow it to soften [Music] or perhaps your mind's eye travels to your neck and shoulders and as it does you experience a sense of letting go and this deep relaxation from the inside washes over your entire body like a wave with the simple act of paying attention [Music] deepen your inhale and watch your body soften as you exhale feel your body begin to

it is your first sip of coffee or tea in the morning or a smile from a loved one it is possible to learn to delve deeper into peace at any moment you can do this by shifting your perspective by fully experiencing the moment and looking for the positive rather than the negative in the situation [Music] imagine shifting your perspective in any given moment a moment such as walking in the rain when you forgot your umbrella [Music] imagine shifting your perspective in any given moment a moment such as a time where you may have missed an appointment or a moment when you have unintentionally

choose to acknowledge the sensations you can see a difficult time as an opportunity to analyze your current physical well-being and begin to make a positive change perhaps a difficult time gives you the opportunity to pause and look within to see if maybe there is something you've neglected right now can you find the gratitude for the health that you do have this is not to say times won't be

eyes thank you for practicing with me today may you experience peace joy and a strong loving connection with yourself
0 welcome and thank you for listening to this guided meditation to practice using a positive internal dialogue as you go through your day there is a continuous dialogue that occurs inside your head often planning for the future or remembering events of the past frequently this includes expectations all of the shoulds and the judgments we have of ourselves that may come from others or from internally sometimes we may knowingly or unknowingly repeat negative statements in our head have negative beliefs or engage in negative self-talk our subconscious mind listens to all of the internal dialogue that goes on whether positive or negative these thoughts act as affirmations and the more we listen to them the more we believe them the chatter in our minds that goes on each and every day is energy and has the potential to play a strong role in our beliefs as well as the energy we send out into this world each time we say these negative things or they are told to us we begin to believe them we send out negative energy and that negative energy comes back to us and these negative thoughts take root in our subconscious they can affect what happens in our lives the choices we make and the way we interact with others each thought has a ripple effect outward on our life much like a stone thrown into a lake making small waves outward knowing this gives us the ability to choose instead to effect ourselves in a positive way we can retrain our minds by using positive thoughts and sending out positive energy by repeating positive affirmations in our mind and out loud these two will become beliefs today we will first begin to relax our body in our mind with attention to our breath and a connection to our senses I invite you to make yourself comfortable you take a moment to settle in you have chosen to take this time to honor yourself in a positive way by bringing mindfulness to the way you live you are strengthening the connection between your body and your mind if you like allow your eyes to close gently down and take a moment to bring your awareness to your breath without changing or forcing your breath notice its natural pace its natural depth and the path it takes inside of your body listen to the sound your breath makes on the inside hear the sound building as you inhale and softening as you let it go hear the rhythm of your breath as it relates to your heartbeat are they aligned whatever you hear is as it should be simply listen and now attend to your sense of smell as you breathe smell the air as it comes into your nostrils what do you sense without attaching a label to the sense simply experience what is around you feel your breath now feel the movement of your breath feel the expansion in your lungs feel the rise and fall of your body perhaps since the way your clothes contact your skin or how the surface below you feels as it connects with your body since the change as your ribs expand and since the pressure building and releasing between the front and back of your body maybe you can see your breath from within visualize its path notice where each breath travels within are there any areas your breath avoids or spends extra time in and since the relaxation and cleansing effect your breath has on your body and mind your breath has the power to bring you into peace begin now to feel the temperature of your breath as it flows into your body is it warm is it cool does it have the same temperature on the out-breath this awareness practice is about bringing focus to your senses there is no right or wrong way to do it no correct answers there is simply awareness and curiosity and what arises for you spend the next few moments being mindful of your senses and your breath as you continue to attend to your breath and your senses begin to explore your emotions as they arise with a curious and kind approach today I invite you to explore your habitual negative self-talk or beliefs without judgment perhaps consider how these things that you may say to yourself or believe about yourself might be limiting you from reaching your full potential and fulfilling your passions know that we are all human and we are perfectly imperfect without mistakes or failures or imperfections we would not grow we would not improve we would not learn new ways of doing things without darkness we would not know the beauty of light without sadness we would not know joy without pain we would not know pleasure know that these feelings coming up are simply energy moving through your body and out into the world and while you cannot stop these emotions you can stop them from taking over and dictating how you respond to your life's events you have the ability to respond in a positive and loving way the positive and loving energy you have in you when you interact with others can affect each event in life place your hand on your heart if you like and tell yourself that you love yourself sit with this feeling without judgment or expectations give love to yourself as you do for others know that you can pause for a moment out of your busy day at any time to say these words and reconnect to your heart practice repeating the following loving phrases in your mind or use your own positive phrases if you choose believe in these phrases in this present moment feel the truth of these statements in your body in your heart and in your mind I am enough I love you I am listening to what you need I am lovable just the way I am I am free beautiful and wise I am perfectly imperfect sit with these positive statements for a few more moments of silence and feel the love building inside of you and now welcome a deep breath into your body know that you can come back to your mindful attention often throughout your daily life you can meet your feelings where they are with kindness and compassion and you can continue to practice building a positive internal dialogue now bring your awareness back to your physical body to the sensations inside you in this present moment continue to invite in a building sense of love an honoring of your beautiful heart take in one more deep breath sending it into the area of your heart to make space for unconditional love and when you already open your eyes thank you so much for listening today

let's begin find a posture of comfort sit or lie down so you can experience ease in your body which will allow for ease in your mind we will start this meditation with your eyes open gently focus your line of vision on one point in front of you you can find a spot on the floor or the wall and now narrow your focus to this one single point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away see all that you can see about this one single point now slowly broaden your field of view like a camera lens widening with a relaxed awareness notice everything you can see in your current much broader line of you without having to turn your head what colors textures and materials do you see do you see brightness or dim light around you [Music] take it all in once more slowly narrow your field of view to the same single point as your focus narrows continue to draw it in until your eyes gradually closed and you invite your attention to turn inward and now start to notice the natural rhythm and depth of your breath without making any changes just notice listen to the sound of your breath look for any movement of your body that is connected to your breath [Music] and now intentionally begin to deepen each breath in and slow down on your exhale as you slow down and deepen your breath take time to notice all there is to experience about your breath [Music] and explore how your breath might change slightly as you continue to look inward [Music] simply notice the experience of your breath without expectations and without judgments what would it be like to offer your breath some love and compassion like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down in relationship to each breath as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen be in the gap no need to do anything simply be in this space without expectations what do you notice in stillness [Music] this is a judgment-free practice of allowing what is there to come to the surface with curiosity [Music] [Music] if you find your mind wandering or your sense of calm begin to dissipate come back to your breath and the gap between thoughts [Music] when we slow down we notice more when we are in the gap we notice what we might otherwise be missing when we rush or overthink experience your body being breathed and let your attention rest on the space between breath and thought [Music] now broaden your awareness to the physical experience of your body look inside and since the energy and feelings of one single point at the area of your stomach what do you notice at this one small focal point [Music] similar to broadening your visual focal point begin to widen the experience of your sensations moving outward from your stomach notice where your body makes a connection with the surface below you perhaps you sense there is a blurring of the lines that separate you from the support and from the energy around you or maybe you feel pressure or warmth at this connection continue gradually moving this relaxed scan of your body helped from your Center notice if there are any parts that are making contact with another part of your body [Music] awaken to the sensations in your body moving out from your Center now since the aliveness in your hands and in your feet [Music] feel the energy moving within you [Music] inhabit your body fully when we can do this live in this body sense our own aliveness we are in the present and living in the space between our thoughts when your mind is attentive to the sensations of your body you can pause you can extend the gap between your thoughts this gap is where you can experience peace and calm notice now if there is anywhere you can soften a little bit more look for any where you can let go even deeper into relaxation and ease let your physical body go so that you can let your thoughts go [Music] imagine your thoughts are like a river flowing gently downstream let your thoughts go so you can be here now awake to the sensations in your body [Music] what would it be like to relax a tense muscle right now what would it feel like to let go of tension and tightness look inside for any areas of your body that are telling you something sometimes the simple act of attending to a sensation allows it to soften or fade away our body wants to be heard to be recognized [Music] invite your attention to move to the areas of your body that are telling you something and feel the sensations there quiet your thoughts to hear the sensations [Music] if you find your mind drifting going back to old patterns of thinking or overthinking lovingly come back gesture your attention to come back to the sensations once more stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment longer knowing that you can always come back to this state of quiet because it has always been a part of you [Music] [Music] take another full breath in and let it out as slowly as you can and do this again letting go of your breath letting go of tension letting go of your busy mind as you brought in your field of awareness once more look for habits or recurring tendencies that you may have to leave your body and come back as many times as you need start over with you're aware presence in life outside of meditation look for patterns when you might be rushing and come back to experience life fully when we slow down and stay with the sensations as long as we can we notice more we live more fully when we are trying to control our life to make it just the way we want it to be perfect we are not experiencing all that life has to offer listen to what wants to be heard see what wants to be seen to do this slow down cause in the gap between thoughts quiet our thoughts to see hear and feel deeply and have it your body fully and be open to life when you were already open your eyes I hope you have a peaceful and calm day thank you for practicing with me

your surroundings you realize that the light you see is shining out from behind a partially closed door at the bottom of a staircase it is seeping out from the edges of the door expanding its light outward you have a sense that behind this door is all that you are capable of and all of your inner potential this light is shining out only a little bit allowing only some of your potential to be seen you know that before this door can be opened all the way there are things that you must let go of and now take a moment and first let go of any negativity you may be holding on to this negativity

of attachments let it all go let go of competition with yourself and with others let go of the idea of being perfect and the need to always be right let go of the shoulds in your life and replace these thoughts with the idea that you are enough being enough means being comfortable with your body as it is today being comfortable with what you have achieved as well as what you have not being enough means self-acceptance and it is something we could all say to ourselves more often let it all go let go of excuses let go of judgmental thoughts let go of jealousy and thoughts of not enough

and motivation on the other side of the door you find a bench to sit down on and you take this new energy confidence and motivation and allow your mind to wander and be imaginative to be open to possibilities and now I'd like you to imagine yourself as a small puzzle piece fitting nicely into the full puzzle that is your life each person in your life is a puzzle piece surrounding you and each fitting perfectly together each facet of your job your family your friends is also part of this puzzle when you change the pieces surrounding you the closest on the puzzle must change as well to stay connected all these changes take time and require patience and some pieces may not fit as well next to your puzzle piece and may need to be switched with another piece that does fit you have the ability in awareness to help this process filter out the pieces that no longer fit as well as have the patience for those pieces that take time to change you are open to change and the opportunities

time for changes to happen and take root yet you are grateful for where you are on this journey you know you are exactly where you are supposed to be right now in life we often need to let go of what does not serve us in order to make room for change in order to be open to the process of change this isn't always easy but you are committed to doing what is right for your best interest and what is in alignment with your values rather than what's easy with change comes various emotions and you welcome them and seek to feel them understand them embrace them and then let them go when necessary you don't give up at times of unexpected pain or challenge you persevere all of your thoughts are positive in your mind you repeat after me I am open to change I am worthy of love and success I am confident I am diligent in moving towards my desired success I believe in myself and my abilities I am courageous and brave I am authentically me I am full of joy I am creating my own future I follow my dreams with passion and certainty I let go of the past and focus on the now I am enough I am grateful for today feeling confident and relaxed you get up from the bench and walk back through the

are experiencing anxiety you are not the anxiety anxiety is only an experience that you are having there is a big difference in saying to yourself I have anxiety or I am anxious versus saying I am experiencing anxiety in this moment the first statement is claiming that sensation as your own which your mind recognizes as something it wants to hold on to because you are the owner of it today is your time to release stress and anxiety you no longer need to take ownership of it take comfort in the fact that like all moments this moment too shall pass the more you can tenderly offer yourself

0 This is a 5-minute “breathing space” practice that you can use anytime, anywhere to regain calm, clarity and confidence.  To begin, become physically still, wherever you are, either lying, sitting, or standing.  Choose a posture where you’ll be as comfortable as possible, and lightly close your eyes.  Bring your awareness to whatever is going on for you right now.  Give the weight of your body up to gravity.  Allow your weight to sink into the points of contact between your body and the floor, the chair, or bed.  What sensations are there right now?  If you notice any tension or resistance towards painful or unpleasant sensations, gently turn towards them.  Accept them as best you can.  If you begin to tense around the breath, then let go a little bit more with each outbreath.  Soften into gravity.  Notice any thoughts as they arise and pass through the mind.
0 Begin by finding a comfortable, relaxed position.  Allow your body to begin to relax.  Breathe in.... and out.....  Take a cleansing breath in.... and breathe out the tension in your body....  Feel relaxation beginning at the bottom of your feet. It might feel like stepping into a warm bathtub... or it may feel like a tingling sensation.... or simply calm and loose. Allow the relaxation to spread over your feet, and up to your ankles.  Feel the relaxation rising above your ankles, flowing up your lower legs.... to your knees.... continuing up to your upper legs...  Allow the relaxation to continue to spread throughout your body, rising now to your hips and pelvic area....  to your stomach and lower back.....  to your chest and upper back....  Let your upper arms relax.... your elbows.... lower arms.... and wrists... feel the relaxation spread to your hands... relaxing the palms of your hands.... the back of your hands.... each finger and thumb.... your hands feel pleasantly warm, heavy, and relaxed.  Feel your body relaxing further as the area by your collar bones widens and relaxes.... allow your shoulders to ease back slightly....  Allow your upper back to relax even further.... let your shoulders relax.... and your neck....  Feel the relaxation continue to spread to your chin... the back of your head.... your mouth.... your cheeks..... nose.... eyes....  Feel your eyelids, heavy and relaxed....  Notice your eyebrows relaxing.... your ears relaxing.... and your forehead.....  Your forehead feels cool and relaxed.....  Let the relaxation spread further to the top of your head....  Your entire body now is relaxed and calm. Feel the relaxation flowing throughout your body, from your head to your feet.  You can relax even further as you let your spine relax completely. Starting where the top of your spine meets your head, feel the relaxation.... feel the muscles giving up their hold and relaxing....  Feel the relaxation spread down your spine... down your neck.... upper back.... middle back .... and lower back.... all the way down to your tailbone at the bottom of your spine...  Notice all of the muscles of your back relaxing completely....  Feel the relaxation flowing throughout your body.  Breathe in.... now hold that breath. And relax your muscles totally, allowing the breath to flow gently out your nose or mouth.  Take another deep breath, breathing in relaxation....  And release the breath. Breathe out any remaining tension.  Continue to breathe smoothly and slowly as you mentally scan your body, looking for any remaining tension.  If you notice any tension, focus on that area. Direct the relaxation to flow into that area, and then carry the tension away.  Imagine that the air you are breathing can cleanse your body and remove tension. Imagine that each breath in carries relaxation. Picture the tension in your body leaving with each breath out.  Now simply relax, calmly, enjoying the feeling of relaxation for a few moments.  (pause)  Focus your attention now on your body, and think about the healing that needs to take place.  Create an image in your mind of your current state of being. Imagine the physical ailment that troubles you. It might be pain, or illness, or injury. It might be something diagnosed, or it may be a problem that is not yet identified. Whatever it is that you would like to heal, imagine this problem in your mind right now.  Focus on the specific location in your body where this problem is present.  You might want to imagine the problem as a dark area, and picture the healing relaxation as light. See the light of relaxation flowing through your body. Direct the light of healing relaxation toward the dark area.  Your body has many ways of healing itself. See the healing relaxation promoting your immune system.... promoting strength... promoting growth of healthy tissue.... removing unhealthy matter from your body.... removing toxins, bacteria, or waste.... cleaning up your body....  Imagine the light of healing relaxation flowing, swirling, touching the edges of the dark problem area in your body.  You might notice small pieces of the dark area being carried away by the healing relaxation.... allow these dark pieces to leave your body as you breathe out.  Breathe in health, healing, and calm....  Breathe out tension, illness, and any problems in your body....  Allow the light healing relaxation to continue swirling around the dark problem area... see the dark area getting smaller...  Imagine the dark area completely enveloped by relaxation....  See the healing relaxation making the dark area lighter.... and lighter... carrying away anything that is not good for your body....  Imagine your immune system working to heal you.... picture the cells you need going to the places they need to go.... working as needed to heal your body.....  Imagine the healing relaxation flowing, coursing through your body.....  Picture your body entirely filled with relaxation....  See the problem area your body is healing.... see it becoming even lighter.... filled with relaxation.... carrying away any discomfort..... healing.....  Allow your body to heal itself....  Take a cleansing breath in.... and breathe out what your body does not need....  Breathe in relaxation.... breathe out all the old air....  Relax for a few moments and imagine the healing process going on inside your body.... feeling confident in your body's ability to heal.... feeling calm and at peace....  (pause)  Now you can choose to return to your usual level of wakefulness and alertness, or drift into sleep.  If you choose to awaken, feel your body and mind becoming more aware of your surroundings.
0 Hello, and welcome to this meditation to relieve depression and anxious thoughts.  Make sure you are in a comfortable position and you will not be disturbed for the duration of this session.  Bring your focus to your breath, and really pay attention to how your lungs expand and contract when you inhale and exhale.  Let your breath flow how ever it wants to right now.  Notice your jaw, and if you feel any tension here, just notice it, don’t try to change anything.  Now breathe into the sensations in your jaw, and as you exhale, allow it to release a little.  Inhale again, imagine that you are breathing in new life, and when you exhale, let all fear completely fade.  Take another breath in, and when you exhale, feel yourself let go of any worries.  Notice how relaxed you are becoming right now.  Let another breath come in naturally imagining a bright future, and as you let it go, notice how depression eases and fades.  A gentle wave of relaxation sweeps over you as you breathe in and out.  Allow your breath to flow naturally now, let yourself feel calm and peaceful.  You deserve this wonderful feeling of serenity.  You are open now to receive new thoughts, and you open up even more with each breath you take to new and fresh energy.  Notice how new ideas begin to present themselves to you.  Bring up feelings of abundance, as if you have so much that your cup pours over for others to enjoy the abundance you have created.  Imagine that you are energized and have a zeal for life. 
0 you're listening to power thoughts meditation club thank you for being here i wonder now if you can imagine a tree outside an autumn imagine the leaves changing color from green yellow red brown and as time goes by more and more leaves just release from the tree letting go naturally and when winter comes the tree stands there without the leaves some people look at that tree and think that there's no life there i wonder if they've thought of all the life inside that tree all the processes going on inside that tree because when the spring comes the new fresh green leaves grow out again if it hadn't been for the autumn being there there would have been no room for the new green fresh sleeves i'm sorry and it's good to know that your subconscious mind works the same way naturally and safely it releases the old and i wonder now if you can allow yourself to access that deeper inner part of you that is calm serene and focused in your imagination everything is possible i'm sorry and the way you imagine your mental pictures the way you hear sounds and feel emotions and body sensations through this process now that is the right way for you to do this so imagine now that directly in front of you is a piece of pure quartz crystal just let your mind focus on that image see its shape texture and beauty and as you do so there is a warm gentle light that begins to glow within the crystal which grows brighter and more luminous as you focus on its energy you become aware of the crystal beginning to grow imagine now growing larger and larger brighter and brighter i'm sorry until the crystal is the size of a small house i am sorry its light pours out from each facet of the crystal and bathes you with warmth and gentleness making you feel so relaxed so peaceful and so calm you begin to explore the crystals in more detail and find now that there is a door which leads into the crystal the door is slightly open allowing a brighter gold light to flow out from the opening gently open the door so that you can walk into the crystal you have stepped into a crystal room which is there just for you this is your own special place the room can be in any shape or size you wish it to be just allow your imagination to create the rule as you want it to be in the colors that you love and feel peaceful with make it as comfortable as you want it to be it is your room i'm sorry please imagine that you look around the room and realize that you have not been in this place for a very long time a film of dust and debris has dulled the brightness of the crystal room so that the light cannot shine as brightly as it should in one corner of the room is a brew imagine now taking hold of the broom i'm sorry start sweeping up all dust and debris sweep it all out of the door and as the dust is swept outside imagine it being transformed bright glittering stardust and the debris is being absorbed into the golden light where it is transformed into positive vibrant energy imagine the dust and debris being negative thoughts that you now choose to let go of you can be at peace now as more and more of the dust and the breeze is swept away out of that door the light within the crystal room glows brighter and brighter so that you are surrounded now by a warm golden glow making you feel safe calmly and relaxed continue sweeping your room till every wall every facet every part of the floor is sparkling and clean clear and pure spring waters and while you are sweeping all your old negative thoughts they are being absorbed into the golden light where it is transformed into positive vibrant energy it is safe now to release these old thoughts and worries into the light and now repeat silently after me i choose to safely release these old unresourceful thoughts and worries with compassion and forgiveness knowing that whatever solution is necessary will manifest when the time is right repeat this to yourself so that you feel it with your whole being please feel the release let them go you can suddenly repeat after me now i am safe i choose think positive thoughts i choose to be free i allow myself to feel good i choose to focus on the positive side of life no matter how thick or thin you slice a bread you always have two sides i allow myself to heal from the inside out i choose to think thoughts that supports my life i allow myself to smile no matter where i am who i'm with what i do i choose to feel optimistic and focused i choose to let go of the old to make room for the new i am a part of nature i'm deep inside i am aware my thoughts create my reality therefore i choose my thoughts wisely i'm sorry from now on i allow myself to feel light and free i am worthy imagine now that you have completed to remove the debris and dust out of the room transformed into that light i'm sorry glittering stardust the imagine inside your room now there is a sofa bed i am walk towards the sofa bed lie down to rest in comfort now as you do so the golden light within the crystal room surrounds you bringing you peace calm and healing just rest for a while now with this nurturing golden light absorbing whatever your body needs for its healing at this time and your subconscious mind will integrate all these positive words i've told you i'm so unsafe and natural way perhaps there is someone you know to whom you wish to send loving and healing thoughts to or some situation that you feel may benefit from healing light take a few moments now to send out healing thoughts to anyone or anything that comes into your awareness now just allow this to happen if it's okay send your unconditional love and healing from your heart now so now that you have rested healed imagine getting up from the sofa bed and move slowly towards the door of the room taking your time to look around at this lovely bright place knowing that you can return here at any time reflect on how beautiful and luminous the light is in this room and store that knowledge in your heart knowing that this beautiful luminous light reflects your own inner light that beautiful unique part of you walk back through the door and imagine that the crystal begins to shrink in size shrinking more and more until it's just a tiny pin of light in your mind's eye you can access this place whenever you want to you can think about that quartz crystal light the brightness and whenever you need to heal whenever you need to feel good whenever you need to feel free come into your room inhale and every time you listen to my voice every time you listen to these words your unconscious mind will integrate this deeper and deeper within you at night when you sleep in your dreams these positive words will be compounded to be stronger and stronger and you'll feel better and better and you're doing good thank you for being here you're doing good i'm gonna do a count now from one to five if you choose to open your eyes you can do that safely if you choose to just relax further just

0 Hey there, and welcome to this meditation to help you reduce anxiety. First, I'd like to invite you to gently close your eyes and take a nice, slow, deep breath in, deeper than you've taken all day so far. And as you exhale, concentrate on the sound of my voice, allowing it to ground you into the present moment, and giving yourself permission right now to focus on you, making yourself your first priority. There is nowhere else you need to be. There is nothing else you need to be doing. For the next several minutes, your wellbeing is your focus. Continue to take slow, deep breaths, allowing each inhale to be a bit deeper than the one before it. Feeling your lungs expand out as you inhale, holding it for a beat and contracting back in as you exhale. And as you continue to breathe this way, feel the journey of the breath through your body and notice any places where you may be holding stress or anxiety in your body. Unfurl your brow, unclench your jaw. Let your shoulders drop down from your ears. Open your palms. And now allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm and pattern, but keep your focus on it and allow it to be your anchor during this meditation. If you get distracted by a thought or a sound, simply acknowledge that it occurred and then gently let it go and return your attention to your breath. When we're stressed or anxious about something, it's often because we don't feel we have control over it, and the sense of being out of control can make us feel less safe, and our emotions heighten. An understandable reaction to this is that we try to control the situation even further. We also tend to judge the situation and even our feelings about it. Those judgments and the stories we tell ourselves about it often become bigger than the situation itself, which adds on even more stress, and the cycle repeats. So right now, I invite you to call to mind a situation that you feel is causing you anxiety. What judgments are you holding about it? As you name the judgment, acknowledge its presence. Now give the judgment permission to drop away. You don't need it anymore. Let it go. And what's the story you've been telling yourself about the situation? As you recognize it, acknowledge its presence and give that story permission to drop away as well. You may notice your mind pushing you even harder to hold onto those judgments or those stories. Recognize and acknowledge those thoughts too, and now allow them to drop away as well. Continue to use your breath to anchor yourself back in the present moment if you get distracted. Now let's look at that situation again without the judgment or the story you were telling yourself. How does it feel different? Has the level of anxiety or stress changed? Instead, I invite you to look at the situation with total curiosity. Now, as we move into the silent part of the meditation, give yourself permission to open up to the clarity and direction on what the very next step for you to take is. Not the next five or 10 steps, not all the steps to the end, just the very next step. And continue breathing with your eyes closed. Just let your attention start to focus back on my voice. Our judgments of and stories we tell ourselves about a situation tend to exaggerate our feelings of unease, anxiety and stress. They can skew what's actually going on out of proportion and they can block us from seeing the truth of the situation and allowing in the ease and comfort we so desire. So the next time you're feeling anxious, remember to breathe and then notice and acknowledge the judgements about it and the story behind it. And then let them drop away and notice how the anxiousness eases. Focus on the truth of the situation in this moment. You have everything you need right now. Now let's take three more deep breaths together. Take a deep inhale in, holding that breath for a beat and exhale it out. Again, an even deeper breath than the one before, feeling it weave in and out of your muscles and cells and exhale it out. Last time, your deepest breath yet sending that oxygen all the way through your entire body. And when it reaches the top of your head and you're ready, you can open your eyes. Thanks for joining me for this meditation and for giving yourself this gift. Have a great rest of your day.
0 this is a meditation on depression it is not meant to fight against depression or hide from it but to sit with it and learn to develop a relationship with these feelings there are many dark and painful feelings you may be experiencing right now it may be that elusive feeling of hopelessness that seems to permeate your thoughts and maybe a feeling of meaninglessness without motivation or purpose it may just be an unexplainable sadness the Sun rises and sets and the days go on but you feel stuck lost trapped in a dark pit depression can feel like a black ink that soaks through your consciousness but there is hope there is always a tiny sliver of light that is waiting in the distance to take you back even if it may not feel that way in the moment or even if it hasn't felt that way for quite some time although you may feel yourself return only in small slow increments this meditation is intended to take you on a journey back to your life back to inner stillness and peace finding a light within the darkness so let's begin allow yourself to sit or lay comfortably with your hands resting gently at your sides or on your legs you may choose to gently shut your eyes or keep them softly focused until they become so heavy that you can no longer hold them open as you get yourself comfortable in these first few moments allow your attention to draw itself to your breathing begin taking slow deep breaths in through your nostrils and start to think to yourself simply in out but every breath in and out and if it feels good to you every once in a while take an extra deep breath and just hold it for a second then slowly exhale in a long comforting release and just fill yourself otherwise breathe naturally as you begin to settle in we'll start by counting down from five and with each number just take a slow healing breath and think to yourself the short phrase focused and relaxed so begin now with breath in five and exhale focused and relax four focused and relaxed your breathing changes during this it's perfectly fine three focused and relaxed two focused and relaxed and one focused and relaxed just let a feeling of peacefulness wash over you your head may be becoming heavy your eyes may push too close if they have not already every muscle relaxing your body sinking deep deep into the surface just continue to keep a gentle and steady breath notice notice now your entire body let me feel a slight tingling in your arms or hands or legs you may even get a sensation of the blood flowing throughout your body or notice your heartbeat you may also notice yourself within your surrounding space or even begin to feel yourself slowly connecting with it almost becoming one instead of a separate entity with everything around you now we will count down once again and this time begin to just imagine a a bright healing light in front of you even golfing you and surrounding you and with each breath just think that phrase healing light and see it now five healing light and end for healing light and specializing see it clearly feel it around you 3 healing light so vivid to healing light healing every nerve in your body and one healing light now as you further draw attention to your body and your relationship with all that's around you just bring awareness to the very top of your head and as you take another calming breath allow a sensation of relaxing energy to flow down your head down your head and through your neck and your shoulders maybe just a slight tingling sensation we also enjoy a pleasant sensation behind your eyes I'm just allowing a soothing weight to push down on them as your head gains that feeling of heaviness feel that tingling wave move slowly down your arms through your elbows and wrists and out the very tips of your fingers continuing to breathe slowly and calmly feel it creep back up and then down to your chest slowly down your door so gently breathing and finally ever so slowly down your legs down your legs and out the tips of your toes peeling that warm calming energy just flowing throughout your body and on these next breaths just pretend that you're standing elsewhere in the room watching your own body within the space and see yourself and visualize it and imagine that you see a warm glowing lights around you now on the next several breaths you will feel that heavy pressure of weight come down on you more and more enjoy this feeling this heavy feeling as you take a breath in can count with me five and out heavy weight heavy weight and for heavyweight throughout your whole body three heavyweight each breath in makes you feel heavier weighed down to each sound of my voice makes you feel heavier sinking sinking deep into the surface and one heavy weight this continue to bring focus to your breath and to my words feeling that heaviness pulling your downward into the floor your muscles just relax and give into it all down down down and as you reach the fullness of this weight take just one minute to soak in this heavy feeling concentrate on that warm glow and give yourself into the words that follow just relax for one minute what your mind creates is not you this depression is feelings it it's not you it has you in its grasp your suffering is real but hopelessness is not real the pain that you're running from and running from is real but the prison bars that you feel trapped behind are not real can you overcome this nightmare can you wake up find your way out of this dark pit from this lonely isolated place that you find yourself in you can and you will and you will wait and practice and hang on to hope because it is there for the taking it is not lost you can escape and you will keep imagining yourself in this warm glow but imagine imagine it change in hue it's a vibrant red around you and then slowly slowly that becomes a bright blue a bright glowing blue and the energy it begins flowing through you as you notice every nerve every limb every part of your body is one within this space energy warm blue glow of light flowing through you and now lastly as I count you will feel this weight slowly and gently begin to lift five you may suddenly see and visualize the vastness and openness of the sky in space for even beginning to levitate becoming lighter and lighter your arms become feathers and you throw off the heavy anvils a surface below you disappears three you see yourself no longer bound by gravity or this room breathing in and out as that glow brightens and it turns into an almost blinding white to lighter and lighter fearless alive free lighter and lighter floating floating up into the vastness of the universe and with one more revitalizing breath I count you to one weightless floating here in the vastness of space and time allow yourself two more minutes just two more minutes to float in this open world within your mind and allow yourself to search for these answers that you so desperately know are within you give yourself just two minutes healing is not instant wounds take time to heal but believe in your healing believe in your meaning and purpose you are still you you are still alive you are here you are okay you are okay this concludes our meditation so please return whenever you are lost and whenever you are ready
0 - Hi, I'm Anisa Benitez, and we'll be doing a guided meditation to reduce anxiety, so find yourself a comfortable seated position, and we'll get started. Bringing your hands to your kneecaps or your lap and taking the first deep breath, in through our nose, (inhales) and out through our mouth, closing our eyes. Again, follow your breath, taking a deep inhale through your nose, and out through your mouth. (gentle ambient music) Follow your breath, taking another deep inhale through your nose, and exhaling through your mouth. And observe the breath. Sometimes we notice that our breathing is not as deep as we thought it was. We might be breathing shallow breaths throughout the day. So how can you take more notice of what it feels like right now, to be breathing as deeply as you are? Now we're gonna hold our breath for a beat at the top. Taking a deep inhale through our nose, inhaling one, two, three, four, holding our breath, one, two, three, four, and exhaling one, two, three, four. Again, inhale through your nose, one, two, three, four, hold that breath, one, two, three, four, and release one, two, three, four. Allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and see how it feels now that you're breathing deeply at the top of your head. Bring your awareness and your attention to the top of your head. If there's tension in your forehead, how can you take a deep breath in and out and feel tension release there? Sometimes you might be holding tension because of concern or worry. Scrunching our forehead to send some breath and awareness there. Take another deep inhale and continue to bring your awareness down your body as we do this progressive relaxation technique known as body scanning. Bringing our awareness now to our cheeks. Maybe it was a day of smiling, a day of talking a lot. How can you bring your attention there and release any tension that might be there in your jawline? Continuing to follow your breath, taking a deep inhale in and exhaling. Bring your awareness down from your jaw to your throat. How can you send a deep breath there? And upon exhaling, feel the tension release from your throat. Maybe there is words unsaid that you might be holding in from the day. How can you feel that tension relax there in your throat? Continuing to make your awareness graze down your body, and while it does so, releasing any tension, stress that we might be carrying in our body. Now in our shoulders, it's so common that we hike up our shoulders. Maybe 'cause of cold, maybe 'cause of tenseness. How can you send a deep breath there and feel your shoulders release and come down? Feel your neck elongate. Continuing to bring your attention down your body, down your spine to your sitz bones, and send a deep breath there. Oftentimes, focusing at the base of our body helps us feel grounded. So take a deep inhale through your nose, and exhale, sending a big breath there. Feeling the tension release, feeling ourselves sink into the earth, feeling ourselves grounded in this moment. Continuing to bring our awareness down our thighs, down our calves, into our ankles, to her toes, to our feet in contact with the floor maybe, and send a deep breath there. Really feeling yourself grounded in this moment. In this moment. Again, take a deep inhale through your nose, the deepest that you've taken all day, and releasing the deepest exhale of all day. And when you're ready, bring your attention back to your surroundings, away from your breath, but know that you can always come back here. Open your eyes. And thank you for taking the time to tune into yourself, to tune into your breath, to feel grounded in this moment. I'm Anisa Benitez, and I appreciate you.

0 I will be guiding you to be an observer of where you are in this present moment to slow down and go within to be curious about your physical sensations as well as your emotional well-being oftentimes all it takes is stepping back from a situation where the habit is reaction so you can simply be aware of a moment and respond more in alignment with your true self and what is important to you you can see the present moment for what it is and Trust the journey I invite you to make yourself comfortable and find a posture of effortless ease where you can be relaxed yet alert you may choose to lie down or sit up when you are comfortable close your eyes or soften your gaze to bring your attention inward as you settle into comfort bring your attention to your breath in a moment I will guide you to take several deep breaths counting your inhale and making your exhale one count longer than your inhale before you do this first observe the quality of the state you are in without making any changes or judging where you are just check in are you calm what is your heart rate like in this moment what is the depth of your natural breath what are the sensations you are experiencing in your body are you warm or cool what else is your attention drawn to as an observer of your state after noticing your current state begin to mindfully inhale and count the length of this breath then extend your exhale one count longer than your inhale and practice this for the next few moments let go of this counting breath and allow your breathing to return to its natural pace and then scan your body once more what is there for you now are there any differences in the quality of your state your heart rate or the sensations in your body now look for anywhere that you can let go of the tendency to hold on is there anywhere in your physical body that you can let go or any emotions that you are holding on to let them go to let go of tension let go of tightness or pain let go of the need to control or hold your posture often we are in fight-or-flight mode or under physical or emotional stress and we aren't even aware of it today right now I invite you to find more ease can you let go of stress and welcome yourself into the rest and digest mode what would it feel like in your body to experience peace to find calm to be still breathe this in experience this right now the stillness this calm state is a time to go within much like winter is a time of unseen growth a time of presumed dormant life or inactivity trust your journey Trust the journey of the seasons winter is a time to turn inward to connect with yourself to be curious about what is there for you you may sense the need to slow down to lower the intensity to rest and prepare for what is to come listen to your body to your instincts what is there for you right now the symbolism of winter invites us to quiet the mind it invites us to wrap up in warmth and find stillness of our soul to seek out serenity this is a time of introversion contemplation and going within see the still state of the life in this season and trust that there will be growth once more see the blessing in the quiet and calm of the winter see the hope for the future of the seasons to come as you look inward what is there for you right now life nature and every person experiences a natural ebb and flow an inhalation period as well as an exhalation period life is the balance of giving and receiving of expending energy and conserving energy during the winter season it is a time to withdraw conserve and rest the expenditure of energy is minimal this is the season that we experienced the longest day of the year and then the return of the light and the lengthening of daylight it is the season during which our energies are naturally drawn inward when we are inclined to be more contemplative give yourself permission to slow down to dream to go within your dreams may be blurry and not fully formed right now plant the seeds of intention for your dreams then open your field of awareness and look for signs look for your dreams to solidify in time be open to the possibilities as they arise as you take your winter season to rest and go inward invite yourself to dream dream of the person you would like to be dream of the qualities you would like to embody dream of your intentions dream of your ideal life letting your imagination run wild with all your senses as if your dream came true in this present moment feel it in your body as if it were true you may see this dream this ideal life in your mind or simply experience the energy of this dream what is coming up for you now breathe this in now plant the seeds for this life now out of these intentions and dreams will come beauty in the seasons ahead out of the stillness and peace will come a balance of energy an exhalation period be patient and listen to what your body is telling you now listen to what your soul needs now [Music] sit with these dreams and intentions for a few minutes longer feel that they are there within you preparing for the future even in this time of stillness take in another deep breath as you bring your awareness to the sensations of your body and the energy of your surroundings since the energy building within you once more knowing that out of this time of stillness comes growth you have taken this time to go inward to dream to solidify your intentions when you are ready open your eyes open to the possibilities of what these intentions will bring open your field of awareness now trust the journey listen observe and be patient look for the seasons to change the energy to shift trust the journey [Music] the love and light and me honors the love and light in you
0 - Howdy pal, and welcome to Yoga with Adriene. I'm Adriene and today we have a meditation for you to help you with anxiety. Happens to the best of us. It can get out of control fast. So, thank you for joining me in this meditation to help quell and soften and maybe even cure you from regular anxiety attacks. Hope into something comfy and let's get started. (gentle music) Alright, my sweet friends, so we're going to begin by finding a comfortable seat and what was a comfortable seat yesterday or where you may end up years from now in your meditation practice or just in your body is just always right in a constant state of flux for so many reasons. So, I'd like to invite you today to really consider what's gonna feel best. If it's leaning up against a wall, snuggle up against a wall. If it's sitting on the edge of your couch or participating in a chair, fabulous. Or you can lie down, you can practice this meditation lying down. So, we definitely wanna come to a place where we feel comfortable and safe to do this brief meditation and to practice the breath, the pranayama, and so today, just an extra gentle nudge to find a comfortable seat and really be honest about that. So, if it's not Sukhasana today, find something that feels supportive and good. For those coming into Sukhasana, you can even play with the legs here, one foot in front of the other, maybe give yourself a nice wide base. So, we'll all come into a position that we feel is the most supportive of us today. Again, it can be lying down. And when you arrive there, really choose to arrive by acknowledging, oh I chose to turn on this video, I made the choice to tend to what's going on, and the first position that I'm even taking here was also a choice to feel supported and comfortable. So, basically we're shifting gears a little bit from a mindset that might feel a little bit anxious or off, and we're starting to get organized in the brain and body and say, okay, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, I have some power here, a lotta power to help guide myself out of that which doesn't feel good and to help guide myself to a place that feels more supported. So, hopefully by now, you found your seat for today, whatever it may be, your place where you are going to reside, and when you arrive there, you can use the sound of my voice now as a guide, so close your eyes and just bring some awareness to your chest, your heart space, and depending on where you're at today, my sweet friend, you might already start to lean in and just feel what's comin' up, let the emotional body have a seat at the table and just notice. And wherever you are today, see if you can begin to do just that, notice. Come into the role of the observer. So, I find it very helpful to close the eyes, relax the shoulders, and bring your awareness to your heart center or your chest area and just allow whatever feelings come up, whatever thoughts, just notice them. And then notice where you might be holding or gripping in the body, the fingers or the toes, the ankles or the wrists, and see if you can use this idea of the observer to just notice all of those points and then in time to allow just the noticing to bring a softness, an awareness. So, your only real job here in this practice today is to pay attention. We use Pranayama technique to help guide the energy of the body and to hopefully help relieve you from feelings that are not serving, if you feel stuck or off or anxious, stressed out. Hopefully, the Pranayama will allow us to just shift our perspective or break the pattern that we might be stuck in. So, after you've taken a couple moments to just arrive here and settle in, acknowledge that you chose this, start to notice your breath. You don't have to do anything, just acknowledge it, notice the natural ebb and flow. Notice what it feels like as you breathe in and notice what it feels like as you empty the breath out. And then again, bring your awareness to your chest again, your heart space, this place that tends to get really tight and collapsed when we feel anxiety, and see if you can start to lift up through that area, even if it's not a big muscular movement but just a little energy. Then allow that to affect your breath, maybe taking a more fuller inhale, feeling the heart lift a little, then perhaps feeling the shoulders relax and soften as you breathe out. So, the neck and shoulders also get a lot of tension, a little tightness when we feel anxious, so use your inhale to feel expansion, and as you start to deepen the breath, use your exhale to find a softness, a surrender. Alright, you're doing great. Stay with it, stick with it, eyes closed, shoulders relaxed, lots of awareness around your heart center, your chest, your sternum. On your next inhale, see if you can bring the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth now, just right behind the teeth, and breathe in, and then breathe out, jaw nice and soft. Again, the tip of the tongue comes to the roof of the mouth and we breathe in. The jaw stays soft, not clinched, as you breathe out. And on your next inhale, we're gonna count to four. Breathe in for four. Here we go. Tongue comes to the roof of the mouth. And we inhale, one, two, three, four, and then just let it go soft and easy. Inhale for four, one, two, three, four, and then let it go. Notice how you feel, stay present, keep observing. Adding onto this ratio, now we're going to hold the breath, retain the breath in between the inhalation and the exhalations for a seven count. So, we'll do one breath cycle, just in and out, and then we'll start with the four. So, breathe in deep here, nice, soft, easy breath. And exhale just to relax the shoulders, empty everything out. I'm breathing in for four. Inhale, one, two, three, four, holding, retaining the breath for seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, and let everything go. Notice what thoughts come up, stay present, let it unfold. Try to keep the body still. And the last bit of the ratio is an exhale for eight. So, we'll inhale for four, I'll guide you with my voice. We'll hold at the top, retaining the breath mindfully for seven and then a nice smooth exhalation on the eight. Four, seven, eight. Soften through your fingertips and toes. One breath cycle, in and out to start, and then we'll begin. Here we go, inhale. Empty it all out. And inhaling for four, inhale, one, two, three, four. Holding for seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And exhale for eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Just notice how you did, no judgment, just observing. Inhaling for four, inhale, one, two, three, four. Retaining on seven, six, five, four, three, you got this, two, one. And big exhale, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Inhale for four, three, two, one. Retain for seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And exhale for eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one. Inhale for four, three, two, one. Retain, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Exhale for eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one. Let everything go. Stay with it. Notice what comes up. Reside in that wonderful role of the observer. And wherever you are, whether you're seated in a chair or Sukhasana or lying down, you're gonna find soft, easy movement with the neck. So, if you're lying down, you might rock the head gently side to side. You might shake the head yes and then no. And then you'll start to bat the eyelashes open. Soft, easy movement with the neck and shoulders. And then we'll take a big inhale in and exhale, sigh it out, so this is important, little big of sound here. Inhale in. Sigh it out. (sighs) And one more time, inhale. (deeply sighs) Hands come together, notice how you feel. Thank you for sharing your time and your energy and your practice with me and all the people around the globe participating, working towards a happy, healthy balanced life. Namaste. (gentle music)
0 This is a guided mindfulness  meditation on feeling overwhelmed. Take a mental step back from whatever you are feeling right now. Allow yourself to be comfortable and to take some slow and natural breaths. In and out... In and out... Feel your breath and body in your space. Recognize that for just a bit, you get to find a comforting space, here, in your time. Just you in your space... ...hearing my voice. Enjoying each moment. Enjoying your presence. Feeling okay with everything just as it is. Just for now. Again feeling so relaxed and comfortable with your body here in this space. And taking natural gentle  breaths as your focal point. We wouldn't be human if there  weren't times in our lives when our hearts and minds became overwhelmed with a weight that we are carrying. These feelings can come from many places. But it is important to know that it  is okay and natural to feel this way. What we can practice is improving a relationship  between these thoughts and emotions. And recognize a response to them. A still and calm mind can bring  us back into the present moment and to tame that heavy weight that can feel as if it reaches  all the way into our soul. That still mind can tame that voice in our head that says the pressure or pain or expectations put upon us are too much for us to handle. Practicing this mindful meditation  allows us to take a gentle step back and see the bigger picture. Just as a violent storm will eventually clear to become stillness. There is a stillness underneath. We can be reminded of the important phrase: "This, too, shall pass." And so, I invite you to focus on lifting  that weight from your mind by sharing these short phrases with me. Feel free to repeat them after me, either out loud or in your mind. Taking your time with each one and allowing the words and meaning to  sink deeply into your consciousness. And so, continuing that breath and body focus, we begin now: "I recognize stress and anxiety." "Like a heavy weight upon me." "I watch and understand it." "I allow myself to let go." "Feeling the weight lifting." "Floating away." "Floating away." "Calm and serene." "Still and present." "Right here and right now." Fantastic. That is the end of the phrases. And did you feel the weight lifting? The burden just a bit lighter on your shoulders. This may take time and may not be an instant cure, but it will help you to step outside of yourself and understand where this weight of these  overwhelmed feelings are coming from. It allows us to purposefully sort our thoughts and more clearly see a path forward. And so, enjoying this time, continuing that gentle breath  and body relaxation focus, I will just read these phrases one after another. You are invited to just listen to them and for any tension that remains, I will help you to escape it. Then I will finish up the  session, just a few minutes after. "Recognize any remaining stress and anxiety." "Like a heavy weight upon you." "Watch and understand it." "Allow yourself to let it go." "Feeling the weight lifting." "Floating away." "Floating away." "Calm and serene." "Still and present." "Right here and right now." This will soon conclude this session. And if you like, take a few last deep breaths, do some shoulder or neck circles, maybe stretch out your arms. Just prepare yourself to finish up this session and to continue on into the  next part of your day or night. Be well, be at peace, be present and mindful of your stress and anxiety. If overwhelming feelings start to overcome you, just remind yourself of how  you can let go of the weight like a helium balloon. Floating away, leaving you calm and serene. Becoming still and present, right here and right now. So long for now.
0 Hello, my loves. Welcome to a Guided Meditation by Lavendaire. I'm happy you made the choice to meditate today  and nurture your body, mind, and soul. Let's get into a comfortable seated position. Bring your hands together and take a moment for gratitude. Close your eyes. What are you grateful for in the now? No matter what you are going through, you can always find gratitude in simplicity. I am grateful for life. I'm grateful to breathe. I am grateful for this moment of peace. Release your hands back to your knees. Take a deep breath with an open mouth exhale. On your next deep inhale, bring your shoulders up, and open mouth exhale, gently bring your shoulders down. Repeat this two more times. Feel the tension and burden release with each exhale. Deep inhale, bring your shoulders up, exhale, gently bring them down. Inhale, bring your shoulders up, and exhale, gently bring them down. Take a deep breath to reset and notice how your body feels.   Now, let's release tension from the neck. Take a deep breath in and on your exhale, bring your chin down to stretch the back of your neck. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your hands behind your head. Hold here for two full breaths. On your next exhale, bring your chin to neutral and face forward.   Then breathe in and tilt your head up to stretch the front of your neck.   Hold here for two full breaths, relaxing your mouth for your exhales. Then reset and face forward on your next exhale.  Onto side neck stretches. Gently tilt your head to the right and hold there for three deep breaths. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your right hand on your head.   Reset on your third breath.   Now do the opposite side. Tilt your head slowly to the left and hold there for three deep breaths. Reset on your next exhale. Take this time to do a couple neck circles on each side. While inhaling, slowly roll your head to the right, then back. And then exhale to the left and then down. Gently, at your own pace, do one more round, inhaling for the first half and exhaling for the second half. Now switch directions. Slowly circle your neck the other way, inhaling to the left, to the back, and exhaling to the right and then back down. Repeat for one more round. When you're done, take a deep breath and open mouth exhale to reset. Notice how your body feels now. Feel the relaxation flow through your body. Now close your mouth and breathe through your nose for the rest of this meditation. We will do a full body relaxation, bringing awareness to one area at a time. First, relax your forehead. Relax your eyebrows. Relax your lips. Relax all your facial muscles. Relax your scalp. Relax your brain. Relax your shoulders. Relax your arms. Relax your hands. And relax your fingertips. Relax your heart. Relax your stomach. Relax your hips. Relax your thighs. Relax your calves. Relax your feet. Relax your toes. Feel your body totally relax. Allow yourself to feel the stillness of this moment. There is absolutely nothing you need to do other than what you're already doing right now. Just relax, breathe, and listen to this audio. Remember this feeling of calm and centeredness. You can come back to this feeling any time simply by relaxing your mind and your body, and by choosing to live in the present moment. Right here, right now. You are safe. You're safe here. Too often, we allow our minds to dwell on the past or worry about the future, causing stress and anxiety. We can't change the past and we can't predict the future. All we have control over is now. So live in the now and do the best you can in the present moment. If you think about it, the past and the future are only a figment of your imagination.   They're illusions, perceptions held by your mind. The only thing that's real is the present moment right in front of you. The present moment is always your place of power. So take a deep breath with awareness of the present moment, right now. Feel the energy you have flowing through your body right now. You are alive, you are here, and you are safe. I'd like to share some positive affirmations with you.   Feel free to recite along with me in your mind. I am enough as I am. I am exactly where I'm meant to be. Energy goes where attention flows, and my attention is here and now. I use my power in the present moment. I am guided, protected, and loved. I trust in the guidance of the universe. I allow myself to let go, trust, and enjoy life. I feel lighter and freer.   I am safe. As you continue your meditation practice, visualize your ideal image of peace. What does peace look like to you? Focus on that image and visualize it in as much detail as possible, inviting sights and sounds, and even smells. Place yourself in the scene of peace. Visualize yourself as your brightest self, feeling light and carefree in this world of serenity. Begin to bring your awareness back to your breath. Take three deep breaths with an open mouth exhale. Bring your hands together and return to your thoughts of gratitude.   Thank yourself for nourishing yourself with this meditation session. Blink your eyes open and see the beautiful world around you. Observe your surroundings with a fresh perspective and continue your day with positivity and peace. Sending you love and light. Namaste.

0 [Music] welcome to our meditation practice today's intention for our time together is to help the mind find peace and balance especially to help ourselves cope with the uncertainty of our world at this time let us begin today by finding a comfortable seated position you can sit on your bed against the wall or on a comfortable cushion if you have one let's begin by closing our eyes and taking both our hands and placing them upon our heart take a deep breath in and listen to your own heart beating in your chest what each beat may it remind you of this beautiful energy life prana that is within you with each beat may take you deeper within at this time into the internal experience of your own being take a deep breath in through your nose no long exhalation out allowing yourself to find this presence comfort and grounding within you slowly release your hands onto your lap let's take the chin hand mudra where we place the thumb and index finger together allowing the palm of the hand to face upward creating a seal of energy within your body close your eyes and allow yourself to go even deeper focusing your awareness to the space between your eyebrows your third eye simply focus and notice if you begin to see any shapes or colors or perhaps just complete emptiness and blackness no judgment here just simply observe [Music] breathing and let it go allow your body to let go of any tension in your face relaxing your forehead allowing your eyes to feel heavy and clenching your jaw complete relaxation of the face then move this relaxation downward towards your shoulders your arms and then down towards your hips and your legs just let it go simply stay present noticing the movement of your breath as you breathe in and out begin to notice any sensations in your body feeling the coolness of the air coming into your nostrils as you breathe in and then the warmth of the air leaving your nostrils as you breathe out [Music] notice if you begin to feel any tingling sensations in your fingers or your toes whatever you are experiencing right now just simply notice it be the watcher of the experience itself allow yourself to find peace enjoy in this simple moment of silence and disconnection you deserve it [Music] this is a time where it's very normal for our minds to begin to want to cling to something a specific thought a memory a daydream or perhaps even fear or the future it will go in many directions and that's okay simply remember to use your breath whenever you feel yourself drifting away from this present moment use your breath to come back to yourself to this moment right here right now wherever you are take a deep breath in and a long and soft exhale of breathing exhale out in this moment it's okay to realize that you may be feeling uncertainty stress or anxiety in your life but remember it is simply a reaction to the circumstances around you which is creating a future that has not happened yet and won't necessarily happen either even though we may not be able to control what life brings our way at this time what we do have control over is how we react to the challenges or any situations that are brought forward to us so breathe in and in this moment choose to let all that negative energy go release it out of you into the ground into the earth choose to find peace enjoy in the simplicity of this very moment simply being here with yourself giving yourself permission to feel to be to let go breathe in and exhale out [Music] as you begin to take your deep breaths I want you to see and visualize a beautiful radiant white light around you it can be crystal white or with a tint of any color that comes to you see this beautiful light of love entering your body with each breath welcome this light through the crown of your head and downward into every fiber and cell of your body visualize this radiant light healing your body in all the ways that you need healing at this moment making you stronger grounded and

beautiful intention to let go of all that no longer serves you and emotions unnecessary thoughts exhale them out of your body your mind and your inner being inhale radiant light exhale all the weight off your shoulders inhale next sale [Music] now as we continue to go deeper and dive further into our inner exploration let's come back to that third eye chakra or the center between your two eyebrows notice how you feel right now don't let your mind win the ego may get in the way making you doubt yourself make you want to stop but simply pay no attention to that energy notice it be aware of it and then take a breath and confirm to yourself that you are in control of your peace your happiness and your well-being take another deep breath in exhale as you let it go as you're allowing yourself to go deeper let's introduce a beautiful and powerful mantra that you can repeat or come back to any time the mind or ego begins to get in the way repeating this mantra as many times as you need and truly seeing it with conviction and love to yourself as I surrender to the uncertainty I am in control I am safe and I am guided as I surrender to the uncertainty I am in control I am safe and I am guided I am in control I am safe and I am guided I am in control I am safe and I am guided stay in this moment of stillness and peace as you repeat this mantra as many times as you need [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] it's time to release your mantra slowly begin to bring awareness to your breath inhaling and exhaling feeling any energy within your body perhaps any tingling or temperature sensations and your fingers arms feet or toes feel your heart beating connect to that rhythm within you in this moment let's take this opportunity to send our gratitude for all that we have right now for your body for your strength and for the opportunity to be able to reconnect with yourself take another deep breath in and let it go as you move forward with your day

0 welcome to the session where we'll be doing a self soothing practice to start settle into a physician of eve's with a straight back and wakeful posture you can imagine there is an invisible string attached to the top of your head holding you nice and tall allow your shoulders to fully rely you rest your arms where they're most comfortable close your eyes so move your breath and feel your body by that and then bring your attention to the state of your heart listening inward in a gentle compassionate way holding a space for what's here now tuned into the flow of your breath allow your mind to rest on the breath as it goes in and out of your body follow each breath attentively silently recognizing each in-breath and each other who now will relax our attention from the breath and open to a sense of self love and compassion and silently repeat the following word may I be happy may I be safe may my heart feel peace and again in your own mind repeat these phrases receiving each of them with a kind and open heart may I be happy may I be safe may my heart feel peace and one more time slowly savor each one may I be happy may I be safe may my heart feel peace you know gently returning to your bra rest in this loving comforting space you've created for yourself but your breath continuing to welcome and soothe you allow your inhales and exhales to soothe any anxiety worry weariness sadness what pain very simply very lovingly let the breath arrive on the inhale you gently flow away on the exhale now gently relax your attention while growing up many of us never had the proper tools or guidance to deal with difficult emotions we never learned to understand our sadness or anger we weren't taught how to calm our anxiety or soothe our frustration instead we learned to distract and avoid the tune out unpleasant feelings with numbing sometimes destructive behavior but no matter what happens we developed when younger in our adult lives mindfulness can help us cultivate the skills of self soothing their meditation we learn how to calm our emotions and settle our nervous system we develop self acceptance and compassion we learn to tenderly be with whatever arises rather than run from it these tools allow us to care for our own hurt so rather than seeking discomfort and distraction or destruction remember to reach for the tools of self soothing be loving and gentle with yourself and you'll be able to hold your own heart give yourself space to feel and time to breathe and become your own source of soothing comfort as Brian andreas said there are days I drop words of comfort on myself like falling leaves and remember that it is enough to be taken care of by myself and as we come to the end of the session in these last few breaths fill up your heart once again with loving kindness now let your awareness return to the room hearing sound whenever you're ready open your eyes [Music] you
0 - Hi everyone. Welcome to Yoga With Adriene. I'm Adriene and this is Benji and today we have a beautiful meditation for mental balance and grounding. So grab something to sit on if you like. Hop into something extra comfy and let's get started. (bright music) Alright, welcome my darling friends. We're going to begin, surprise, our practice today in a comfortable seat. So take your time. Just notice if you're kind of rushing right now here and let's start to slow it down as you come into a nice cross-legged seat. And I will encourage you, particularly if you're new to sitting (chuckles) in a meditation to lift your hips up either on a couch pillow or if you have a bolster, great. You can fold up some blankets or some towels are just fine too. And get to where your hips are a little bit higher than your knees so you can create these two slides of the thighs down. And as you start to get settled in here, just start to tap into that inner smile as much as you're willing. This is my power tool, my secret weapon that I often talk about so it's not so secret, but just as you settle in you can start to kind of feel the benefits of this time that you're taking for yourself by softening and, yeah, tapping into that inner smile. It can be like, "I'm doing this." Or, "Oh my god, I need this." Whatever it is just tap into a little joy that you're taking this short but valuable time for yourself. Benji's relaxed. If you're not relaxed, we'll get you there or we'll try. Hopefully by now you're in your seat. Getting settled in. And if you are working with your back right now, we'll say that, feel free to sit up against a wall or you can even do this in a chair. You just want to make sure that your spine is nice and long. And on that note, let's take a moment here to gently tuck the chin. And bring more awareness to the spine. So that could be sitting up tall. It could just be noticing your pattern. Again, just gently tucking the chin. Feeling that length as you do so through the back of the neck. And best you can bringing more awareness to your spine. And if you haven't already, allow your hands to soften, fingertips to soften just wherever feels good and then as I often invite you to do in practice same thing here. Just notice what feels good today. Whether you need a more grounding palm. Right? Energetically, I'm here. (exhales) "I'm doing this. I need to breathe. "I need this time for myself." Or maybe you're feeling pretty good and this is more preventative care today. So open those palms up baby. Allow yourself to be a little more vulnerable, open. So, both are vulnerable, but you get to decide. And really we're connecting the brain to the body here. So there's so much that goes into these little gestures and making decisions for yourself. If you know a mudra you want to take it now, please do. And then if you haven't already, close your eyes. Allow your eyelids to get heavy here. And if for whatever reason you're not comfortable with the eyelids closed, just soften your gaze gently down past your nose. (light music) Alrighty and we've begun. Chin slightly tucked. Neck long. Hands, arms, carefully placed. Fingers soft. Let's start by noticing any sounds around us. Wherever you may be today. Or maybe you're relishing, silence. As we start to settle in and ground down, allow any extra movement, patterns, just fidgeting, see if you can allow them to soften as you build a little structure for your mediation here. In time finding stillness with more ease and being kind if you're noticing a lot of fidgeting or patterns. No worries. That's why we're here. To observe. With kindness. To welcome balance and clarity to both the mental and emotional self. Now most of you have already likely begun to notice your breath but if not allow me to roll out the red carpet, to bring fresh picked flowers to your doorstep and welcome you to just notice with a loving kindness your natural breath. And as you begin to notice the rhythm of your natural breath today, see if you can take it one step further. Inviting the mind to also notice what the breath does to the body. As you breathe in and out. Notice, if you can, what parts of the body move as you breathe in. And see if you can notice how gravity tends to take over as you breathe out. So we have this sense of a rise and a fall, nice and easy, nothing forced. Just noticing what moves as you breathe in. And embracing the gravity as you breathe out. Now you can keep going just as is or I'll bring another fresh bouquet to your door and invite you to deepen the breath just a bit. Bringing more consciousness, more loving awareness to that inhale and watching the ripple effect as you breathe in. And using that exhale to ground down. Relax the shoulders. Relax your jaw. Allowing your inhale perhaps to be a little deeper, more full. And perhaps, when you're ready, allowing your exhale to be longer. Think of it as a beautiful extension. Breathing out as you ground down, down, down. Now go ahead and let your nice conscious deep breaths rest. Return to just a nice, easy, natural rhythm and flow. With so much love and a gentle, just gentleness, see if you can reestablish this awareness in your spine by maybe lifting your heart, gently sitting up a little bit taller. And you might feel, if you're doing this with your eyes closed, as though you grow a little bit longer and taller in the spine. And as you rest easy here in your seat, soften the skin of the forehead, relax the jaw and again use a gentle exhale to relax the shoulders down. You're more than halfway through your mediation. So as thoughts come to your mind, to your soul, just acknowledge them and come back to a loving awareness of your breath. So beginning to deepen the breath a little bit. Again here, see if you can find something new as you breathe in. Embracing gravity as you breathe out. And now one final invitation. As you continue to breathe and lean into the dance of feeling the inhale lift you, a rise. And feeling the exhale ground you, the fall of the breath. As you lean into that balance of the two, I lovingly invite you to just bring your mind's eye to the tip top crown of your head. Place your attention there. And then imagine, head over heart, heart over pelvis. Then from the crown tip top of your head in your own way, whatever this means to you, draw a line from the top of your head down through the center core channel of your being, all the way to the base of the spine. So we've placed a light rope or pipeline, a cylinder, whatever it is for you, this awareness from the crown of the head to the base of the spine. And see if you can allow that action, that awareness, to affect your breath or to at least notice if it changed the way your holding yourself up here with each inhale. And the way you're using your exhale to continuously ground down. And for the last minute here, we'll take that line from the crown to the base of the spine and just hang with me, my friends, continue that line down. Past your physical body, down into the earth. Continue that line down to the core of the earth. And then notice how that makes you feel. Notice if, and it may not, if that effects the way you carry yourself here, the way you breathe in and the way you breathe out. Now take three final conscious breaths. Finding balance and a sense of calm or peace between the dance of the rise and the fall. The lift and the ground. The earth and the sky. Then release your conscious breaths. Rest easy here as you slowly drop your chin to your chest. Try to keep the shoulders relaxed here as you gently open your eyes. Can flutter the eyelashes open. And when you're ready, gently lift your head. Cue the birds outside my window. We'll bring the palms together. Just take one quiet little beat here to notice how you feel. And we'll close it off by bowing together and whispering, Namaste.
0 Our own self-talk can contribute to the pain and low self-esteem that is sometimes associated with rejection or failure. This relaxation script will help you to identify the feelings and thoughts related to rejection and failure, and to change this negative thinking.  Get comfortable in a quiet place where you can relax.  Begin to relax your body by first tensing a muscle group, and then releasing to create a feeling of relaxation. Start with your arms. Close your hands into tight fists, and tense your hands and arms...all the way up to your shoulders. Hold this tension for a count of five: one...two...three...four...five. Now release, allowing your hands and arms to become limp.  Rest for a count of ten. One...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Now repeat, tensing the muscles of your hands and arms...holding very tight...very tense...one..two...three...four...five.  Relax, letting the muscles become relaxed and loose. Relax your arms even more deeply...allowing a feeling of heaviness to grow with each number...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Focus on your legs now, tensing these muscles from your hips...to your knees...to your feet. Hold the muscles of your legs very tightly...filled with tension...hold for a count of five. One...two...three...four...five.  Release this tension, allowing your legs to relax completely. Rest for a count of ten. One...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Repeat, tensing your legs again, holding very tightly...feeling the tension in each muscle...one...two...three...four...five.  Now relax, releasing the tension you have been holding in your legs. Relax completely, feeling your legs become heavier and more relaxed...relaxing even more with each number...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Tense the muscles of your back now...one...two...three...four...five...and release...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Tighten the muscles of your chest and stomach. Hold..one...two...three...four...five...and release...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten.  Now practice holding and releasing tension with your breath. Breathe in deeply and hold that breath. Hold...feeling the tension...and then relax...breathe out...releasing all the tension with your breath. Take another breath, breathing in deeply...and hold. Now release, relaxing as you breathe out.  Allow your next breath to occur naturally...smoothly breathing in as much air as you need, and then releasing the air naturally, exhaling fully. Breathe slowly in and out...letting your breaths occur at whatever pace is comfortable for you. Feel your breathing slow naturally...becoming very calm.  (Pause)  Now that you are feeling more relaxed, think about the feelings of rejection or failure you would like to deal with.  Think about a time when you felt rejected or a time when you believe you failed in some way. When did this rejection or failure event occur? What happened? Imagine this rejection or failure event in detail, remembering as much as you can.  (Pause)  Now think about how you felt when the rejection or failure event was happening. What emotions did you experience at the time?  (Pause)  What about afterward? What emotions did you have after the rejection or failure occurred?  (Pause)  How are you feeling right now, as you think about the rejection or failure? Notice how you feel emotionally and physically in this moment.  (Pause)  Now examine the thoughts that go along with your emotions. Picture the event when you experienced rejection or failure. What kinds of things were you saying to yourself during and after?  For example, perhaps you were rejected by a friend who told you that he did not want to see you. You may have had thoughts such as:  He does not like me.  I am no good.  I am not fun to be around.  No one likes me.  I’m a loser.  These types of negative thoughts lead to the unpleasant feelings you experienced. If you want to feel better, you can change the negative thoughts to more realistic ones and your feelings will become more positive.  One way to change negative thinking is through affirmations to build confidence and increase self-esteem. Let’s work on increasing confidence now.  First, focus again on relaxing your body and calming your mind. Let all your previous thoughts go, and be only in the here and now.  (Pause)  Breathe away the thoughts, just allowing them to pass...letting each thought slip away...  You do not need to do anything in particular...just relax...and let your thoughts pass, without dwelling on any of them...  (Pause)  As you begin to relax, allow yourself to open up to the idea of feeling confident and secure...strong and positive...imagining what it would be like to experience positive feelings and believe positive things about yourself.   Imagine what it would be like to look at a situation with new eyes...with self-respect...  Imagine how you would handle rejection or failure as a self-respecting, confident person...treating yourself with respect and love...  Think about the idea of accepting imperfection...of allowing mistakes and learning from them...think about all the true, realistic things you could tell yourself if you experience rejection or failure.  Instead of saying, “he does not like me" or “no one likes me," you can tell yourself the following types of statements:  I cannot read people’s minds. The thing that happened does not necessarily mean that he does not like me. There are people who care about me. I care about me.  Instead of saying, “I am no good," you may say:  I made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. I do not like making mistakes, but I can learn from my errors. I choose to learn from this experience. I have many good qualities and I also have flaws.  Think about the more positive, more realistic, encouraging statements you could say to yourself about the situation where rejection or failure occurred.  (Pause)  It is normal to experience rejection sometimes. You are a human being and all human beings go through rejection.  Remind yourself that you are a good person.  It is okay to feel upset. Know that these feelings will pass. You will soon feel better.  Be kind to yourself. The most painful rejection is the act of treating yourself unkindly. Be a support to yourself.  (Pause)  You are a human being with both strengths and weaknesses. It is okay to have flaws. You, like all people, will make many mistakes in your life. Errors are part of being human.  We all fail from time to time. Failing at one thing does not make you a failure and it does not generalize to you as a person. A failure at one thing can be better described as a mistake, rather than a failure.  Failing at many things, that is, making many mistakes, is a healthy, normal process. Successful people fail many times. You are a successful person.  Mistakes can be turned into positives by growing from them.  (Pause)  Now you can simply relax...no need to focus on anything at all.  Just drift...relaxing...  (Pause)  Allow a feeling of confidence to begin inside...deep within your core...it may feel like warmth...such a solid, strong feeling...  Let this confidence grow...getting bigger...radiating from inside you...filling your entire body from head to feet...shining from you and lighting up the room you are in...  It feels so good to be filled with confidence.  Allow the confidence to grow...all on its own...it grows without you doing anything at all...getting bigger...even stronger...feel the confidence that fills you...  Any negativity in your life can be a trigger for this confidence to grow. Rejection or failure... upsetting events...anything negative in your life can remind you of this feeling of confidence you have right now.  When something negative happens, find that a feeling of confidence begins inside and grows...filling you with strength and poise to deal with the situation. You can feel good and feel confident even in circumstances that are less than ideal. Negative situations can be a cue for this confidence to grow.  Feel the confidence fully, right now...filling you with complete confidence and calm.  (Pause)  Keep a feeling of confidence with you as you complete this relaxation exercise. Take a few moments to re-awaken your mind and body.  Open your eyes and look around the room, becoming re-oriented to your surroundings. Stretch if you want to, and feel your body waking up.  When you are fully awake and alert, you can return to your usual activities, feeling confident and calm.
0 Take a moment to settle into a comfortable position.  Notice now, how you are feeling.... how you are doing right now in this moment.  How does your body feel? Scan your body for a moment now, starting at your feet, simply noticing how your body is feeling.  Notice your feet... ankles... legs.... hips. Continue scanning your body, moving upward to your stomach, back, chest, sides. Mentally scan your hands, arms, and shoulders... your neck, head, and face.  Where is your body the most tense? Where is your body the most relaxed?   Just notice the state of tension and relaxation in your body.  Notice how your body relaxes... bit by bit.... without any effort on your part. See how your muscles become a little bit looser... less tense.... naturally, just because you are taking a moment to sit quietly and relax. Without any effort or input from you... without you even trying... your body becoming slightly more relaxed with each passing moment.  Think about your body image... what is body image? Maybe you think about the picture in your mind you have of what your body looks like. Maybe it's the ideas you have about your body... your feelings about your physical self. Perhaps body image is is a vision of how you think your body should be. What does body image mean to you?  Take a moment now to consider your thoughts and ideas about your own body. How are you feeling right now, thinking about your body image? You might feel neutral, content, comfortable, uncomfortable, satisfied, dissatisfied, happy or unhappy, angry, afraid, accepting..... maybe a combination of things.... contradictory feelings are common.... and it is okay to feel however you are feeling.  What might it be like to accept your body, just as it is? What if you felt okay about your physical self? Imagine for a few moments what that would be like.  Think about a time in your life when you felt accepting of your physical self - your whole self, or even part of yourself.  Which parts of your body are the easiest for you to accept?  Imagine if you could accept your body as a whole, rather than as a collection of individual parts.  You have been doing some difficult thinking these last few moments. Let's take a step back now, mentally, to relax.  Breathe in, deeply. And breathe out.  In.... and out.....  In... and out.....  Keep breathing deeply, slowly. It feels good to take deep, calm breaths.  Just relax for a moment while you notice your breathing. Just notice your breaths for a moment.  (pause)  If there are any areas where you are feeling tense, direct your attention to these areas as you breathe.... imagining that each breath in brings relaxation... and each breath out expels tension. Breathing in relaxation... and breathing out tension..... each breath relaxes you further.   (pause)  Now I will say some body image affirmations. You can repeat these if you wish, or simply relax as I talk.  Each affirmation is true.... even if it may not seem true right now.  Let's begin the affirmations.  I am okay the way I am.  I can accept myself the way I am.  My body is acceptable just the way it is.  I am an okay person.  I accept this body I am in.  There is no need to be perfect.  My imperfections make me unique.  I am perfectly alright just the way I am.  My body is a functioning whole.  I am human, and all humans have flaws.  I can accept my imperfections.   I free myself from judging my body.  I am okay just the way I am.  I accept myself.  Now that you have repeated some affirmations, take note of how you are feeling. What was it like to repeat or listen to the affirmations?  It is okay to feel however you are feeling right now, good or bad. Accept the variety of feelings you may have.  Take a moment now to just relax. Let all the worries and tension go as you breathe slowly in... and out.... in.... out..... continue to breathe slowly, deeply.... naturally.  When you are ready to return to your waking level of consciousness, slowly leave this relaxed state you are in. Keep with you a feeling of calm, while becoming more awake and alert.  Wake up your body and your mind. Move your arms and legs a little and feel your muscles reawakening.  I'll count up now from 5 to 1, and when I reach 1 you will be fully awake and ready to return to your usual activities.  5  4  3  2  1
