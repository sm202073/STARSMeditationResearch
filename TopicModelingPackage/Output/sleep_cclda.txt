1 my name is Jason Stephenson and welcomed this guided morning meditation as you slowly awaken this morning this meditation will gently guide you into a natural embrace of the day ahead before we begin I invite you to come into a comfortable position whether that sitting or lying down ensure that the spine is straight your shoulders are relaxed and the neck should be aligned with the spine gently relaxed so just take a moment to adjust yourself in any way necessary just to ensure you are comfortable and supported when you were ready allowing your eyes to gently close to begin this meditation simply come to notice your breath you without trying to change it without judgment or assessment notice the nature of it witness the way it effortlessly moves into the body and then back out you just become attuned to the natural flow of the breath as though observing the breath the full length of each breath in and out you you you as you begin to settle take a moment to witness the entirety of your body End mind our thoughts often when we wake of our dreams and we hold on the thoughts about the days behind and the days ahead of us so simply begin to observe from a place of non-attachment whatever you may be carrying in the physical body just gently witnessing any areas of tension or discomfort and in breath to nurture these areas take a few deep breaths into each area of the body calling for your attention and then gently release them allow your body to sink for a moment into complete stillness and silence you you in the same way now draw your attention to anything arising in the mind now there is no need to search for anything simply observe yourself open up to the thoughts that may be pre-existing they make themselves known just witness the nature of them the same way release them simply intangible ideas about what has come or what may be to come as you do this naturally notice yourself sinking further into this present moment sinking deeply into this waking day you whatever ideas you have about the day ahead I invite you to set them aside a short while you explore the moment you are presently in just notice through the physical body the surface that supports you you are seated on or the mattress you were lying on might be the floor quietly observe any sounds or physical sensations around you strong or subtle you and through your closed eyes notice if there's any sense of sunlight trickling in shadows dancing behind your closed eyes you as you come to mindfully explore the world around you there is silence and stillness begin to make note of the presence of day you just continue to allow the breath to guide you through this gentle awakening of the senses noticing how you are inextricably linked through the breath to the world outside of you allow each in-breath to nourish you and each breath out to free you of any constriction fatigue or even thoughts that may be lingering allow yourself to be nourished through the breath as you open your heart to this new day you you I invite you now to draw your awareness to your belly and as you do watch the way the breath flows in through your chest filling the entirety of your lungs causes the stomach to expand to rise and you might witness an expansion of the chest area as well an opening up of the heart space you if the mind wanders continue to simply invited back down and into the physical body wait for now simply embrace and enjoy these quiet moments of stillness presence and awareness allowing yourself to tune into the energy of a gentle a natural expansion that comes with sunrise you now from this place of complete awareness and presence tune into the heart space drawing your awareness to the center of the chest and allow your heart to expand as it expands envision it touching all possibilities for the day ahead you might envision a white or a golden light radiating out from the heart making contact with the future that is continually unfolding you if you find any anxious or fearful thoughts arise just witness them without becoming attached to them and gently focus back into your heart space or into the golden light radiating from this space within you you focusing now on your highest potential and visions for the day it might be goals that you want to achieve things that you want to set out to do or you need to do and allow any cluttering or limiting thoughts to naturally fall away and there is no need to force anything out of existence or to judge or condemn anything that might be arising less than your highest potential arises simply notice it acknowledge it and allow it to dissipate you whatever we envision on a regular we start to manifest in the outer world consciously reflect for a moment on whatever it is your highest self wishes to manifest in your life or more specifically in the day ahead what is the deepest yearning of your heart what is the energy you wish to carry with you throughout your day continuing to feel into the hearts glow and compassionately allowing conflicting mental chatter to subside as a higher truth reveals itself you begin to narrow in on what is it you wish to manifest considering for a moment that you already hold whatever it is you may take a few moments to breathe into this feeling as if it is already present within you allow your thoughts to be clear and conscious stemming from the core of who you are you might like to consider in the words of Rumi what you seek is seeking you just allow the openness of your heart to hold the truth that whatever you hope to embody is already here it is already present within you you just coming back to the body now and taking in a few more grounding breaths before setting a powerful intention for the day ahead allow yourself to be completely here truth to go and nothing you need to achieve as we increase our ability to be fully present and limiting thoughts begin to fall away and you begin to embody more deeply the truth of who you are silent and steady breaths here rooting yourself in the expanding energy of this morning you so from this place of pure presence but you now to set one more clear and powerful intention for your day consider whatever it is you wish to embody and state it to yourself as if it were already here for instance if you are longing is for self-confidence and esteem consider a phrase such as I am confident and complete or if the stability and safety are of your highest concern perhaps an affirmation like all of my deepest needs are being met just allow yourself to become very clear and focused on your intention as you begin to repeat it to yourself with each full breath so take a few moments of silence here as you align your intention with your breath letting the words fill you up entirely again and again but just a few moments you so wherever you are now resting come to notice once again with eyes closed environment around you feel into the physical support of the ground beneath you of the material world it has been manifested around you see if you can notice the air of the room that you are currently in sounds near far you take three more full breaths here knowing that you are unconditionally supported in this journey gently begin to soften the area around the eyes and when you are ready slowly open them up to the world around you noticing the delicate transition from dark to light as you move forward in outward action continually come back to the intention you are carrying within you knowing that the universe is here to support guide and nourish you with every step that you take
1 hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this guided meditation designed to help you ease into a deep and peaceful sleep while lowering your blood pressure naturally and effectively through mindfulness conscious breathing and deep body visualizations this meditation will create an inner experience of relaxation as well as guide the heart towards a healthy smooth and steady rhythm over the next short while allow my voice to guide you into this deep state of relaxation knowing that the hearts flow will follow suit as you sing further into stillness before we begin ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of any required alarms should be set and nothing else should remain on today's to-do list [Music] take some time now to settle into a comfortable lying down position using any blankets and cushions to support your body where needed if possible on the spine and neck should be in line to help open the flow of energy through the entire body tune in to your entire body now as you make any final adjustments that will support your progression into a deeply relaxed and peaceful state I invite you now to simply bring your attention to your breath without trying to shift it in any way just gently open your awareness to it observing its natural flow rhythm and depth [Music] notice the way the breath comes and goes on its own accord guided by innate wisdom that does not require any effort on your part it simply comes and goes just as the ocean eps and flows [Music] as you draw awareness to the breath notice if it naturally shifts in any way again there is no need to intervene or manipulate its rhythm but you may find that as you tune into the breath it might naturally deepen slow down or adjust itself in some other way just [Music] notice if this is true for you and also notice if it is not there is no right or wrong way to notice the breath simply observe it however it comes and follow it wherever it flows [Music] [Music] [Music] throughout this meditation the mind may entangle itself in thoughts of the past or in visions of what might come to be if for when it does simply acknowledge this tendency as a movement away from this present moment before drawing your attention back to the breath if thoughts arise simply witness them for a moment with compassion and non judgment before returning to your unchangeable Center no matter how frequently they crop up no that is entirely normal for thoughts to rise and entirely possible to gently let them go use the breath as your anchor at any point during this meditation to reground yourself in the physical place that you rest [Music] draw your awareness now to the stomach noticing its natural rise and for as breath moves through you in our busy day to day activities we often breathe primarily from the chest restricting our breaths range of movement this shallow breathing engages our stress response and releases a surge of hormones that temporarily increase our blood pressure [Music] as we naturally expand the breaths movement moving it effortlessly into the stomach we activate the relaxation response this deeper breathing pauses out of an inner state of stress and helps us to sink effortlessly into stillness and soon into a state of deep sleep continue to focus your attention on the stomach noticing just how far the breath can go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] take a moment now to acknowledge this physical place you are in without engaging the Mayans and our living capacity is it possible to simply witness the space you occupy to witness the physical world you are intimately connected to [Music] notice the service that supports you and notice any soft textures around you draw your awareness to this very simple moment knowing that there is nowhere else you need to be you are nowhere else but right here right now and all that is asked of you is that you open your heart and awareness to this beautiful moment before you fall into a deep and restorative sleep [Music] [Music] [Music] as you notice your physical surrounds you may also become more deeply aware of your physical body maintain awareness of the breath flowing through you as you begin to scan the body gently starting up the toes and traveling up to the crown of your head [Music] [Music] there is nothing you need to look for in this process he was simply called to witness whatever exists within you [Music] [Music] [Music] if any tension or discomfort appears in your awareness simply embrace it with your loving awareness and open your breath up to this area that is calling for your tender love and care if there are no strong sensations to notice simply grant your entire body with your compassionate attention and let it melt further into stillness [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] feel entirely free to also make any physical adjustments to your positioning that will help to provide you with more comfort if you adjust yourself at any point during this meditation simply do so mindfully and slowly to help foster this growing sense of peace and serenity inhale as you make any movements and exhale deeply as you settle in to any new positioning [Music] [Music] hold your physical body in your awareness now as you begin to envision it's sinking deeper and deeper into the surface beneath you or tension is invited to melt away and all muscles are invited to relax completely with each inhalation you are infused with the greatest sense of relaxation and with each exhalation you release any lingering knots of tension or stress just take a few deep breaths here [Music] envisioning this process that is moving through you inhale relaxation and exhale any remaining tension in the body or mind [Music] [Music] I invite you now to draw your awareness to the heart space and to invite your breath into it breathe slowly and steadily here filling the heart completely on each inhalation and softening it on each exhalation [Music] come to notice the steadiness of the heart space it's slow flow and its openness as you breathe you bring the heart into greater harmony and equilibrium [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to slow down even more and to further this process of relaxation begin to add counts of four to your breath on your next inhalation breathe in to a slow counter for pause for a brief moment at the top and then exhale for a full count of four take three full breath cycles here following this guidance if it feels comfortable to you [Music] [Music] [Music] envision the heart slowing its pace and vision it relaxing completely into this moment it is beating naturally and effortlessly without you needing to intervene in any way simply by slowing the breath the heart follows suit simply by engaging in mindful breathing mind body and heart all come closer to complete relaxation as you settle into a sense of the heart beating slowly and steadily start to expand your field of awareness by imagining the pathways that flow into and away from the heart [Music] envision the life force that travels through your heart pumping smoothly and effortlessly this life force your blood nourishes your cells as it flows steadily through your body know that without any effort without any force or manipulation the body is nourishing itself in this very moment open your heart a little bit further with each full breath knowing that you are being supported by the body's innate wisdom right now [Music] [Music] [Music] continue to expand the breath envisioning and traveling throughout the entire body where attention goes energy flows [Music] as you expand your awareness to encompass the entire physical body life force in all its forms follow in that direction [Music] watching the breath flow steadily know that your blood is traveling in the same manner effortlessly extensively and wholeheartedly as you sink further into stillness trusting the body's wisdom [Music] the heart continues to beat slowly and steadily without any effort required on your part there is nothing you need to do and nothing you need to fix in this very moment your body is in harmonious flow [Music] begin to gently release everything held in the mind any visions thoughts or any mental chatter that may have crept up release it all on your next exhalation [Music] as you let go gently imagine the mind dropping down to the heart space slowly unfastening itself from the headspace passing through the space between your brows down the nose through mouth and throat and landing softly in the heart [Music] without creating any visions thoughts or feelings of what this looks like simply hold your awareness in the heart and explore what it feels like to be in this space continue to breathe deeply through the heart [Music] [Music] in a moment we will enter into a few moments of silence you may choose to retain your breath as your anchor and focus for these moments or if it suits you you may introduce the following information on each inhalation as we sink into silence you may quietly repeat to yourself I am flowing and on each exhalation you may repeat I am releasing I am flowing I am releasing I am flowing I am releasing invite this affirmation into your heart now or simply continue to breathe from the heart with your awareness focused on your breath [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now gently release the affirmation if it is currently passing through you with each breath and come back to the steady rhythm of your heart exactly as it is let go of all effort or focus and any visions that may still be moving through you as you come quietly into pure beingness as you slowly drift into sleep there is nothing you need to carry with you so begin to shed any remaining thoughts now simply practice for a few more moments this art of pure being [Music] let each part of the body soften as you allow this physical space to support your journey into sleep [Music] allow the gentle flow of music to rock you into a deep slumber until you finally come to sleep for the night continue to breathe deeply and slowly allowing your breath to guide your hearts flow and guide you into a state of tranquillity know that the body's wisdom will continue to support and nourish you throughout the night and that you were deeply supported by the energy flow that makes this life possible [Music]

balmy night you are safe laying in a peaceful field on a rug you feel comforted and supported by the beauty of the Bible black night sky [Music] you've never seen the stars shining so brightly each one of the trillions of stars above you presents their own magic to you comforting you keeping you safe offering their presence and reminding you that you too are part of this enormous expanse you have never been separate always connected and at one [Music] the stars have been waiting for this moment to connect with you and for you to connect to them as you pee up into the night sky it's almost as if the stars are reaching down to you Olly Olly wanting to be closer to you leaving trails of white sparkly streaks as they do so whispering to you the beauty you see above you is the beauty you have within they continue to slowly fall towards you almost like some scene from an imaginary fairy tale it's almost as if you could reach out right now and you could touch them these stars are puncturing the night sky with their brilliant light and there are trillions of them galaxy after galaxy some of the stars are so close to you and yet others are beyond the beyond the depth of these shining beings of light is incomprehensible as you witness this in awe and wonder just allow your eyes to wander across the entirety of this expanse you can see some shooting stars across the patches of darkness like a memory they are there one moment and gone the next reminding you again of the fleeting moments of life all of life is transient nothing stays the same and this too is okay you see that some of the stars are dim whilst others are shining brightly [Music] breathing in and out deeply releasing and surrendering all to the night sky allow your eyes to come to rest where they may no

sleep so take a few deep breaths now as you open your heart to this nourishing and rejuvenating nighttime visualization before sinking deeply into this meditation ensure that all end of day activities

that the neck is in line with the spine promoting a subtle openness of the chest and heart [Music] relax all muscles of the face softening the eyes and eyebrows the forward and the jaw take a few more breaths here to really ground yourself into this still and quiet state of being [Music] [Music] the light begins to dim having cleansed your body and mind entirely this dimming invites you into a deeper and peaceful sleep allowing you to rest completely throughout another night you feel yourself sinking further and further into the surface beneath you everything within you that does not support your sense of relaxation has been released there is nothing else for you to do nothing else to be envisioned or thought of you are entirely at peace as the steady rhythm of your breath rocks you closer and closer towards a deep and nourishing sleep [Music] draw your awareness now to your physical body but to no point in particular simply make note of whatever you notice as you are called to draw your attention to your human form without judging or assessing whatever you come across simply observe if there is any sense of heaviness constriction or judgment and invite your breath to these areas allow your breath to nourish and release any sensations of tension that may be currently present within you [Music] remember that all feelings and sensations are passing they come and go like gusts of wind or like waves simply providing an opportunity to take a deeper look inside [Music] [Music] continue witnessing and breathing into any discomfort that might be present until all that is left is a sense of lightness if there are stubborn areas that feel constricted somehow that is okay do not worry yourself with being anything other than what you are simply open your heart to the possibility of infusing this experience with a sense of weightlessness if you need to you can mindfully adjust the body in any way to provide yourself with more comfort move gently and slowly promoting the relaxation and effortlessness that we are cultivating if your mind wanders at any point during this visualization know that this is entirely okay if you come to notice at any point that your attention has been consumed by thoughts or worries of the past or future simply acknowledge the thought wave compassionately before releasing it back to the open space that it came from in this moment there is nothing view to figure out in the mind nothing for you to anticipate or fear simply draw your attention back to the breath as the mind wanders knowing that you are entirely supported by my voice the music and the universe it is safe for you to slowly and gently let go come back now to your breath and again draw your awareness to your stomach as your attention shifts to this deeper area of the chest cavity your breath will naturally follow along take three full breaths here and with each one notice your entire body becoming more expansive notice your mind and body getting lighter and lighter allow the mind to sink further and further into the heart until nothing remains but a vast openness as clear as pale blue sky [Music] now begin to imagine that you were looking up at this expansive blue sky from a beautiful open field you are resting in the center of it comfortably with cushions and blankets observing the freedom inherent in this natural landscape wildflowers grow abundantly throughout the sea of green that surrounds you [Music] above you is a nearly cloudless sky and a warm Sun that invites you to breathe a little bit deeper and you do breathing in the pure air of the world around you you are feeling completely at ease within this landscape your breath flows smoothly and deeply as you allow the physical world to support you here [Music] overhead something begins to appear out of the distance as it makes its way closer to the air space directly above you you come to see that it is an eagle soaring freely across the clear blue sky take a few moments to observe the smooth curves it makes as it wings and carves its way through the air it is both strong and light moving with both confidence and grace the Eagle continues to dance through the sky as it makes its way closer and closer to the earth it appears to be approaching the very field you rest in but nothing about its approach frightens you in some strange way you feel that this bird is no different from you and you know deep in your gut that in no way can it harm you in fact the eagle brings you a sense of inner peace courage and lightness you've heard much about Eagles knowing that their presence is an invitation to move deeper into freedom soaring high above the sky Eagles suggests to us that now might be the time to look at things from a new perspective these birds grant confidence and courage to look ahead they symbolize new beginnings self growth and personal awareness as you observed the Eagles flight you are blessed with its wisdom feeling refreshed and renewed [Music] you witness the eagle landing on the soft earth beside you as you rise to your feet to welcome its arrival the two of you meet eyes and then bow your heads in respect of one another with the great eagle just before you you stretch your arm out to touch its soft code noticing how calm and relaxed it is within this environment and in your presence the eagle is free unbounded by fear and anxiety as it welcomes your tender touch it reminds you that you too have nothing to fear breathing deeply soaking in this sense of freedom and on your next exhale you release all residual tension that lingers in body and mind you are complete at peace with this great bird knowing that in fact you are one and the same [Music] [Music] the Eagle takes one last look at you and turns preparing to take off once again preparing to set sail in the clear vast blue sky as the great bird turns its head you realize that by some divine magic you have become this eagle gazing up towards the open sky you realize that it is you who is preparing to take off to release everything that tethers you to the physical world to soar high above the earth free and unbounded the Eagle came for just a moment to show you that her way is your way that nothing stands in your way of experiencing what it feels like to be entirely free and suddenly in the midst of this realization you lift off from the security of the earth to experience a complete lightness in your being you saw ever lessly above the planet extending your arms with the same strength and grace shown to you by the Eagle that had once been with you now it is you now you are the eagle entirely free and unbounded by any and all earthly concerns within this incredible open stretch of clear sky you set yourself free you are entirely at peace with this present moment [Music] [Music] as you witness yourself floating effortlessly through this open air you feel nothing and everything no worries no fears and no attachments and yet you feel harmonious with everything around you you are in a state [Music] eat of deep peace as you allow yourself to surrender completely to the lightness of the universe around you [Music] take a few more full breaths here deeply into the belly as you allow yourself to revel in this moment there is nowhere else you need to be but right here grant yourself this time to be full be at peace and fully supported by the universe around you you are fully supported here unconditionally [Music] [Music] slowly you begin to feel yourself coming back down to earth with the energy of the Eagle ingrained deep into your cells you know that you carry this energy of freedom wherever you go whether high above the earth or nestled into the comfort of your own bed with each exhale you sink a little bit further back down to earth back down to the surface that supports you in this very moment you settle now back into the earth gently releasing all visualizations of the Eagle the sky and the abundant field you once rested in even though you have returned to this physical space you still carry the wisdom of the eagle deep inside yourselves the feeling of being entirely free lingers within you come back once again to the breath bringing your attention now to the heart inside this space in your chest you may envision a warm white light beginning to appear with each breath it grows expanding softly and swiftly to touch each cell of your body soon your entire body is bathed in this warm white glow as you feel yourself letting go of this day completely as you feel yourself inching closer and closer towards sleep [Music] the light begins to dim having cleansed your body and mind entirely this dimming invites you into a deeper and peaceful sleep allowing you to rest completely throughout another night you feel yourself sinking further and further into the surface beneath you everything within you that does not support your sense of relaxation has been released there is nothing else for you to do nothing else to be envisioned or thought of you are entirely at peace as the steady rhythm of your breath rocks you closer and closer towards a deep and nourishing sleep [Music] welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to find peace and inner tranquility before you naturally fall into a deep and restorative sleep over the next short while you'll be guided to relax the body and ease the mind before being led through a visual journey into a mystical cave of peace it's your time to allow yourself to be carried away gently through this journey knowing that you are entirely supported in this present moment so take a moment now to ensure that all end of day activities have been wrapped up alarms should be set and liens drawn you I invite you now to come into a comfortable lying down position ensuring that your body is resting with ease wherever you are you might want to use blankets or cushions to support you as you find comfort in the physical space you occupy take a few releasing breaths here allowing a deep sigh to leave your body on your next outward breath [Music] to begin our journey into tranquility take a moment to observe that the stillness of your physical body [Music] as day transforms into night and the Sun fades away we are invited to enter a much needed period of rest and rejuvenation as we sink into the stillness of night rest assured there is nothing we need to consciously engage in or take care of we can trust that the body will work by its way of its innate wisdom so take a moment now to quietly observe the miracle of this body feel into its heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you you might want to notice now where there might still be movement despite the sense of stillness notice where breath brings subtle movement to the body how it causes the chest and stomach to expand on each inhalation and to fall away on each exhalation [Music] observe how beautifully this gentle movement intertwines with a deeper sense of complete stillness as you take a few deep breaths here in silence [Music] [Music] if thoughts arise in the mind no that is entirely natural for them to do so as you become aware that your attention has shifted into stories about the past or future simply acknowledge these thoughts from a more distant place than is habitual [Music] while the mind can be useful at times it can lure us into an unproductive thought cycles when left to run on its own terms as we begin to witness our mental movements from a higher or broader vantage point we practice our power of discernment easing challenging thoughts and emotions as we experience greater clarity and a sense of peace as you journey through this meditation keep this sense of distance in mind as thought arises and return to your breath as an anchor when needed [Music] [Music] move now further into breath awareness as you practice holding your attention on this anchor that is always available to you [Music] notice the breaths rhythm its pace and its depth as you move alongside it in both directions hold for a brief pause just a second or two and at the end of each inhalation and each exhalation finding brief moments of complete stillness within each breath cycle [Music] you [Music] allow the mind to gently subside as you become more attuned to the present moment attachment to worried anxious or distracting thoughts can be released as you practice being the observer of whatever is moving through you just allow yourself to sink further and further into this very moment entering naturally into a state of full-bodied ease and tranquility [Music] with your eyes remaining closed tuned into the space between the eyebrows just in front of your mind's eye envision in this space of vast emptiness something like a clear night sky sink into this infinite abyss of space and silence for a few moments as you prepare to enter into a cave of complete peace and tranquility as you gaze with eyes closed into the empty sky in front of you envision your view dotted with infinite sparkling stars you are in an open outdoor space surrounded by the open air lakes rivers and mountains the moon is high and full [Music] tune into your breath for a few moments noticing the freshness of the air that fills you [Music] just follow my voice for a few breaths here as you inhale deeply breathing in a sense of being completely at ease and exhale slowly releasing any tension or stress in body or mind inhaling again visualizing yourself filling up with peace and ease and exhale fully releasing anything that no longer serves your movement towards complete relaxation breathing deeply once more filling yourself with the freedom and freshness of outdoor air and exhale completely releasing all tension to be transformed by the starlit sky returned gently to your natural breath allowing your mind to refocus on the empty space in front of your mind's eye though night has fallen upon this outdoor landscape the land is lit by stars and moonlight granting you with enough light to see the curves of the earth take a moment now to simply observe the way the rocky mountain faced peaks and Falls and the way rivers and lakes gently caress the hard surface of the earth notice how peaceful it is here beneath the night sky as you feel yourself coming into complete harmony with the natural world [Music] from where you stand you see an empty cavern not too far away illuminated by the full moon above its spaciousness its emptiness cause you towards it so you begin to walk slowly and mindfully towards the sheltered space within the mountain notice the way your feet effortlessly move across the earth you feel completely at home in this natural landscape as you move towards the cave that beckons you quietly as you reach the opening to this wondrous cave your original sense that it rests unoccupied is confirmed there is no one here but you know plant life inside and no animals the only thing that you have yet to sense within this cave is a deep stillness it is completely silent and yet something about it is calling to you in the faintest whisper recognizable only by your heart by the entrance of the cave there is a candle placed here by some universal force for whoever might come to rest here you light the candle with a match that has also been provided and quietly make your way inside the dark cavern fear anxiety and worry are completely absent all that is present within you is a growing calmness he reached the center of this mystical cave that has called you into it setting your candle in the center and bringing yourself to rest comfortably on the floor lying on your back you stare up at the ceiling noticing the incredible edges carved by nature breathing deeply and feel entirely at peace in this open and empty space [Music] silence surrounds you as the mind rests in a deep state of peace and tranquility your breath continues to flow through you effortlessly and gracefully [Music] yet within this vast silence something in this cave is speaking to you the mind cannot decipher it but the heart knows that there is a great wisdom radiating out from these walls you listen more intently to this language still foreign to the mind and find that your heart begins to open up the serenity of this space softens your heart as a deep trust infiltrates your entire being in this serene state you find a calm and the quiet sense of courage to ask this cave any questions that might arise from your purest heart as you allow your heart to ask these wise walls any questions that arise you find that the questions themselves are infused with trust rather than with fear and anxiety your heart speaks calmly and quietly the mind resting peacefully in the background and as you listen closely with your heart remaining open you find that the walls speak back in silent whispers gently wisely and compassionately this is the language of the heart and you open yourself to it completely [Music] you do not have to search for any answers you trust that they will come in their own time patience and peace arise within you [Music] you [Music] the cave sends its wisdom enough form of whispers visions and inner sensations though not all at once this mystical cave knows that some answers require extra time to be revealed and that when the time is right the answers will be provided you open your heart even wider sinking further into the peaceful and serene energy of this cave spend a few more silent moments listening to the wisdom of the wars that surround you the mind remains quiet as the heart remains receptive [Music] coming now to a deeply settled state you turn your head to blow out the candle that is beside you your mind is calm your heart is warm and your spirit is nourished notice a deep trust arising within you a completely calm presence radiates throughout your entire being all at once there is no separation between you and this mystical cave an overwhelming sense of oneness comes over you [Music] [Music] as you sing further and further into this deep tranquility of darkness your body returns to the physical reality of the room that you rest in witness the surface now your body rests on observing quietly all the tangible items supporting you here and now feel into this supremely calm state allowing your breath to rock you closer and closer towards sleep all images melt away from the heart and mind as you come back to a place of deep physical presence notice the air around your body the warmth of blankets and cushions the heaviness of your limbs your torso your head and the rest of your body [Music] each breath travels deeply into your lungs transporting vital life energy to every cell of your body you can rest with ease knowing that as you sleep this process is being taken care of by the body's innate wisdom there is nothing else for you to do nothing else for you to ask think believe or create all that the heart yearns for now is this deep sense of peace and contentment to carry you into a peaceful night's sleep as you breathe your conscious awareness begins to melt away asleep comes to restore your entire being continue to follow the breath quietly and effortlessly until everything slips away soon you will enter into a peaceful slumber where the caves mystical energies will replenish you entirely mind body and heart [Music] welcome to this bedtime meditation designed to promote more peaceful and soothing dreams whether you have experienced difficult dreams lately or an absence of dreams this meditation will help to set the stage for beautiful imagery to visit you as you sleep while listening to this meditation simply allow your body to rest and your mind to expand as you drift into beautiful places using the power of your attention so now I ask you to take a few deep breaths opening yourself to this powerful practice of visualization before we set the stage for better dreams to come to you let's take a journey into the body and mind exactly as it is now to prepare I invite you to make yourself entirely comfortable lie down in any position that is comfortable to you however you rest remain mindful of keeping the neck in line with the spine to help promote a sense of openness and relaxation within the body proper posture even when sleeping helps to promote positive feelings that will carry over into sleep making any final adjustments necessary just allow yourself to come into a state of complete stillness the only observable movement now should be the breath as it makes its way through the body opening the chest and expanding the belly [Music] as you witness your body coming into stillness notice how the breath naturally slows itself [Music] you might even allow a deep sigh of relief to leave the body on an exhalation releasing any unnecessary tension or concern that lingers in your body [Music] [Music] begin to open your senses up to the world around you beginning with your ears start to become mindful of the quiet space that is around you and of any sounds that pass through this sense of stillness when opening the ears there is no need to search for noises or to label any sounds that arise simply observe whatever is going on around you through your sense of hearing [Music] [Music] [Music] become aware now of the physical space you reside in noticing the sensations of the surface beneath you of any cushions or blankets above or against you notice if there is any particular sensation of the air around you does it appear to be still or in flow is it cool warm or possibly neutral just allow your physical body and its capacity to feel the ground you deeper into this present moment [Music] [Music] I invite you now to move a little further into the body following the movement of air into your lungs tune in to the sensations of it as it enters and leaves you as the belly rises and as it falls without attempting to change the breath in any way allow it to carry you further into the experience of inner stillness even amidst its constant flow [Music] allow the physical body to settle reaching a point of complete ease and comfort if you feel it is necessary to adjust your position in any way just move slowly and mindfully as you come into a place of deeper comfort [Music] [Music] take a moment now to observe the mind you might find that thoughts and associated feelings linger beneath the surface of an otherwise very still state if thoughts are present simply observe them from a place of compassion and non judgment just see if it's possible to observe them as an outsider without becoming consumed by the stories they tell and then return your attention to the breath [Music] at any point you can use the breath as a tool to draw you back into a present state of awareness when we draw our attention to the mind during meditation we might find that enchanting visuals accompany the stories we tell the point of this meditation is not to banish or look down upon this imagery that we create unconsciously meditation is simply a call to become more conscious and mindful of what is happening inside of our heads the mind is a powerful tool that can either entrap us in imagery informed by fear or that can be used to enhance our lives and create more positive beliefs ideas and dreams take a few moments now to practice being an outside observer of thoughts and imagery that appear in the mind simply become more attuned to the way that your thoughts give life to your visions knowing that you hold the power to turn your attention away from any storyline that is guided by fear worry or anxiety [Music] rather than force your thoughts to become something you might deem to be more positive take this time to let all thoughts dissolve continue to focus on the breath moving through you as you sink further and further away from mentor distractions [Music] [Music] [Music] with each inhalation you might envision yourself being infiltrated with lightness peace and contentment and with each outward breath you can imagine that all negative and unconstructive thoughts and beliefs are being released allow yourself to become completely at ease within this present moment [Music] take another moment to feel into your physical body knowing that you are entirely supported in this moment physically emotionally and spiritually and that even through this simple act of slowing down you are beginning to invite more positive dreams into your evening sleep from this deep sense of underlying stillness I invite you now to use the power of your mind to enter a visual place of peace beauty and serenity there are no rules as to what this place should look like so long as it brings you a sense of inner peace the place you choose might be a beach a mountain range a lake or somewhere further afield perhaps somewhere far into outer space this is your vision take a few moments now to settle on your preferred location allowing it to enliven itself in your mind's eye commit your awareness to building this peaceful space in your mind allow it to expand naturally alongside your growing sense of inner tranquility build it using the blessing of all of your five senses [Music] unioned your sense of sight first allowing your visual sense to build this place of your truest dreams [Music] what colors and textures are present to the eyes other animals plants or other humans around you here what does the sky look like from where you look out what elements are present [Music] simply tuned into the visual presence of fire earth water and air if any or all of these are present [Music] allow your creation of this space to include your sense of sound is it completely silent where you are or are there subtle noises present possibly there's a recognizable beat or rhythm in any sounds that might be growing in this space or are the sounds disorderly like the unpredictable pitter-patter of rain simply allow that whatever brings you peace to arise in this place of beauty [Music] tuning in now to your sense of smell are there any recognizable aromas that are present here from the smell of salty water to fresh earth and autumn leaves allow nature's aromas to trickle into this imagery you are resting within and if nothing arises that is fine too there are no rules to what your mind creates so long as it brings you comfort consider your sense of taste now allowing your experience here to delight your taste buds as you explore this peaceful landscape is there anything that you feel compelled to taste you might want to indulge in wild berries in pure spring water or in some of a worldly treat born in outer space just allow your experience to be rich divine and fulfilling nourishing your entire being and as you explore this place either walking slowly through it or from a resting position allow yourself to feel into it through your physical body what nourishing surfaces does your body come into contact with how does the air feel against your skin thus the Sun or moon beamed down on you filling you with a sense of ease and enchantment just allow whatever brings you deep peace to express itself here [Music] now I invite you now to tune into this place you have created with a sixth sense that is with your hearts feeling as you breathe and vision your heart expanding with each inhalation and softening with each exhalation [Music] with each breath allow your heart to open up to the piece you have just built within you let this space nourish your innermost being wholeheartedly take a few more moments to allow yourself to play rest or recharge in this beautiful and tranquil environment you have conjured use each of your senses including your heart to explore this moment as fully as possible [Music] [Music] in this very moment you feel a deep sense of care love and support granted to you by the universe by the beautiful space you have created and by your highest self and clearest mind [Music] everything in this space and time is exactly as it is meant to be and you feel highly attuned with all that is around you slowly I invite you now to gently release the imagery you have created letting go of the taste and texture and the sights and sounds gently release your vision of this beautiful place knowing that in some way on some other field of reality it is still very present within you even as the images fade away you maintain the heartfelt sensations this visualization opened you up to inside of you there is a deep sense of peace beauty and contentment [Music] come back now to the breath watching it flow gently and steadily through you [Music] you as you return to this physical reality that you are in you begin to feel more grounded and present within your environment there is a deeper sense of that inner stillness you know is always within you so take a moment to draw your awareness through the body blessing the entirety of your physical being with deep rest and relaxation release any constriction in the belly the chest area soften and loosen the jaw release [Music] and your forward allow the entire body to relax completely as you prepare to enter the dream world [Music] as you settle into a state very close to sleep little pieces of your peaceful paradise linger in the back of your mind unconsciously through the power of this visualization you have set the stage for beautiful dreams to carry you through the night ahead all tension worry and fear have melted away and in its place nothing but lightness and peace remains allow your breath to continue rocking you to sleep alongside each breath cycle you might silently repeat this following affirmation until slowly this awakens state drifts away my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with beautiful visions keep your heart and mind wide open your body rooted in a sense of inner peace and harmony and allow the infinite possibilities for beauty to infiltrate your dreams continue whispering silently my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with beautiful visions until this wish becomes a slumbering reality [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome to this guided meditation to help you release all muscular tension and to help you fall into a deep and peaceful sleep over the course of this meditation you will be guided to bring your awareness to each area of the body to feel into it to tighten it and then to release it completely allowing the entire body to come to a state of total relaxation so before we begin this journey just ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of if you require an alarm to be set just quietly set it now if there are blinds that need to be drawn or bright lights that can be turned off just take care of these small matters before settling into a comfortable lying down position you [Music] wherever you are ensure that the spine and neck are straight but relaxed and that you are supported in any way that you need take your time to adjust any cushions or blankets so that you are as comfortable as possible in this very moment [Music] set an intention now to fully let go through both body and mind as we enter a process of complete release [Music] you now let's begin by becoming more mindful of this exact moment in time and space begin by drawing your awareness to your ears and to all the sounds that you may currently be infiltrating through them as you open your hearing simply observe all the sounds that come from subtle hums to more prominent noises outside [Music] without judging or labeling these sounds practice remaining in a state of deep awareness as vibrations filter into your eardrums and as they disappear [Music] [Music] allow the Mayans tendencies to categorize to label and the judge to step aside as you simply witness these noises as dynamic expressions of life as simple and subtle vibrations of energy now expand your awareness of this present moment by beginning to observe the physical space you rest in notice the air that touches your skin and the material world that supports and surrounds you take a few moments to observe each inch of your body that is in contact with the physical world you might come to notice the temperature of your body and surfaces around you you might observe the textures of blankets and pillows that brush against your skin and you might even observe a barely describable feeling of support of safety or of heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you [Music] notice if the body's formation or sensory experience changes in any way as you become more mindful of this physical space you are in [Music] become more mindful now of your breath quietly observing the rhythm and depth of its present form [Music] [Music] to be mindful does not mean to change or to manipulate the present moment in any way that the mind deemed to make better or worthy to the contrary mindful awareness asks us to open to and to accept this moment exactly as it is so with this in mind see if you can open to your breath exactly as it is right now releasing any judgment or expectation for it to feel any differently and it presently does [Music] you if a natural deepening occurs allow this simply noticing it as a natural movement of energy further into your being continue to observe the breath for a few more moments feeling into the expression of each inhalation and each exhalation notice the feeling of air entering through your nasal cavity filling your lungs and pressing upward against your belly and then notice the same dynamic movement in Reverse observing any sensations connected to your fall exhalation [Music] just breathe here in mindful awareness for a few more silent moments [Music] if the mind wanders at any point during this meditation see if you can refrain from judgment as you compassionately call your attention back to the present moment it is in the mines nature to wander but with that said we can use the power of our intention to refocus our attention back on this present moment this refocusing is what helps us to enter an expanding state of complete of relaxation in just a few moments we will enter into a full-body scan through which you will become deeply aware of the presence of tightness in the body and then of the feeling of complete relaxation you will be guided to witness tighten and release each area that we pass allowing each part of the body that come to deep rest and complete ease in preparation for a peaceful night's sleep [Music] as much as possible see if you can align tightening movements with your inhalations and all movements towards release with your exhalations just breathe naturally in between each muscle group that we work on so before we begin into this body scan I invite you to make any adjustments now that will help you to feel into the entirety of your body you might find that it is easiest to access each muscle when in a straight line down position on your back however if this is not comfortable for you come into a position that is as neutral as possible while remaining comfortable [Music] ensure that the chest is open with shoulders drawing away from the ears allow your breath to continue to be in the background of your awareness secondary only to your gently shifting awareness of the physical body so begin by noticing your toes feeling into them exactly as they are in this moment [Music] notice if there are any sensations present any tightness or softness [Music] and now consciously tighten just your toes on your next inhalation observing what it feels like for them to be pulled inwards completely and then exhale letting them go and allowing all tension melting away with these now bring your awareness towards both feet toes and ankles included [Music] observing them exactly as they are in this moment on the next breath in tense all muscles in the feet area holding tightly for just a brief moment and then release all of the tension on your exhalation allowing your feet toes and then goes to rest back down completely and breathing normally for a few moments [Music] [Music] observe now the presence of both of your legs drawing your awareness all the way from your heels up to your hips noting any sensations you pass along the way hold the entirety of both legs in your awareness and then inhale as you tighten these muscles squeezing them in towards your midline hold there for a moment and then exhale releasing them completely into the surface beneath you [Music] moving to the area between the hips draw your awareness to your pelvis on your next breath in tighten all of these muscles holding them for just a brief moment and then release them completely on your next breath out just feeling to this complete release from your pelvis downward letting each of these areas sink further into the support of the physical world observe the stomach region now becoming aware of its present state [Music] and then as you inhale tighten all of these core muscles holding them in tightly for just a moment as you hold the breath in and then release entirely as you exhale softening all muscles around the belly return to your natural breathing rhythm as you relax the stomach completely now expand your awareness of the stomach to encompass the entire torso from lower back to upper and from belly up to the shoulders take a moment now to observe each muscle group in the core of your body [Music] now on your next inhalation tighten them or towards the midline of your body feeling them in a contracted state and then release heavily with a sigh allowing your entire torso to relax completely [Music] take a moment here to reconnect with your breath mindfully observing its present form bring your awareness now to your hands fingers included observe the way they are resting in this moment noticing if they are relaxed or tense or somewhere in between as you inhale allow all of these muscles in the hands and fingers to tighten coming into a compressed fist hold for a brief second or two and then exhale as you release allowing both hands to rest completely relaxed draw your awareness now from your wrists all the way up to your shoulders and compasses and areas in between so inhale as you contract all of these muscles perhaps pulling them up towards your ears and then soften releasing all of these muscles in the limbs back down shoulders falling back down gently as well notice how different it feels in both body and mind between your contracted States and your softened ones now begin to observe all of the intricate muscles in your face noticing if there are any sensations present here [Music] consider the muscles in your jaw your cheeks your eyebrows and your forward now inhale as you contract all of these muscles squeezing your entire face together hold for just a moment observing the sensation and then exhale as you release all of these muscles completely let go of each muscle allowing all tension to drain away take a moment to come back to your breath for just a moment observing the entire body right where it is and right as it is [Music] observe this neutral state just for a moment and then on your next inhalation contract every muscle group accessible to your awareness squeezing the entirety of your body towards your midline hold everything together with the breath held in and then release completely letting a deep sigh escape from your lungs as all remaining tension and stress falls away allow each muscle to melt into the surface beneath you allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm as you sink further and further into the experience of this complete relaxation [Music] continue to breathe naturally mindfully observing the flow of air into and out of your being in this state of deep relaxation and release there is absolutely nothing to do but be entirely present with every muscle group relaxed completely you are moments away from drifting into a peaceful sleep that is in alignment with your present state of tranquillity allow your breath to become like waves your body is soft and gentle as the water beneath the surface as you breathe notice yourself being rocked gently into an even deeper state of tranquillity the mind follows the body's lead quietening softening as you come into harmony with everything within and around you with every inch of your being having been consciously relaxed allow yourself to float effortlessly into a deep slumber allow your breath and the sounds to soothe your entire being as you slowly but surely descend completely into restorative and peaceful night's sleep [Music] and allow these affirmations to sink into your subconscious mind even if you do fall asleep trust that these affirmations will assist you as you drift deeper deeper into sleep I am relaxing deeper and deeper my mind

what you are feeling in this moment as you acknowledge your experience allow it to be just as it is with acceptance this is not to say you are giving up you are simply not adding more suffering by resisting reality invite ease into the areas that may be asking for your attention approach this practice with acceptance as you give yourself permission to have whatever your experience is let go of resistance let go of judgment practice surrender now begin to move your attention slowly over your physical sensations begin at the top of your head and scan your body's sensations from the inside with a flowing attention all the way down to the soles of your feet as your attention flows from one part of your body to another pause and linger on any areas that seem to be asking for your attention give each of these sensations the notice that it is needing your physical body is your anchor or your reminder for this meditation so if you find that your mind has wandered off into a story or thoughts about something else lovingly bring it back to the current experience of your sensations notice any areas of your body where you are experiencing feelings and simply be with the sensations without labeling good or bad or telling a story of why these sensations are here stay with the felt sense of the sensation and let go of your ideas about it welcome anything and everything you are feeling be with the actual experience of your body and let go of your resistance to this experience what would it be like for you to encourage a release a letting go of any tension as you move your awareness around your body let go of your attention and attachment to what isn't working for you let go of what is no longer serving you this tension may have been there to serve you at one point but now you can let it go perhaps it resonates with you to visualize a letting go you may see a beautiful bird fly off into the sky or a feather being carried by a light breeze or any other visualization of letting go that shows up in your mind once your awareness reaches your feet bring it back to the top of your head and begin again this time as your attention flows through your body focus on any areas of ease and softness within your body sense the quality of this area even if it is the smallest area fully experience an area of your body where you are feeling ease sense all there is to notice about this ease within you know that it is available to you invite these areas of ease to spread know that what you focus on expands so welcome your sense of peace to move and grow expanding outward connect with what is good and allow the good to radiate outward just like the rays of sun expanding outward in all directions what would it be like for you to experience a feeling of love and kindness for your body right now breathe this in stay with the good the positive sensation that is already within you is an opening for your attention go through the opening and invite in more of what is good offer each and every part of your body love and compassion you may find it difficult to send love to an area of chronic pain or dis-ease that is okay do your best to be with everything that is part of you acknowledge the messages your body is sending you and nurture yourself with love stay with the sensations continue to build the ease softness and peace within you send gratitude and love to each and every part of your beautiful body heart and soul what would it feel like to let go in any way that brings you deeper into comfort are there any areas that you can relax further maybe you sense a shift as you allow your body to sink down into the surface beneath you let gravity settle over you there is no need to hold against it anymore there is no need to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders any longer give yourself permission to enjoy letting go into relaxation now is your time to be fully supported to let go and relax anywhere you can as you continue the journey into deep

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this bedtime meditation designed to promote more peaceful and soothing dreams whether you have experienced difficult dreams lately or an absence of dreams this meditation will help to set the stage for beautiful imagery to visit you as you sleep while listening to this meditation simply allow your body to rest and your mind to expand as you drift into beautiful places using the power of your attention so now I asked you to take a few deep breaths opening yourself to this powerful practice of visualization before we set the stage for better dreams to come to you let's take a journey into the body and mind exactly as it is now to prepare I invite you to make yourself entirely comfortable lie down in any position that is comfortable to you however you rest remain mindful of keeping the neck in line with the spine to help promote a sense of openness and relaxation within the body proper posture even when sleeping helps to promote positive feelings that will carry over into sleep making any final adjustments necessary just allow yourself to come into a state of complete stillness the only observable movement now should be the breath as it makes its way through the body opening the chest and expanding the belly as you witness your body coming into stillness notice how the breath naturally slows itself you might even allow a deep sigh of relief to leave the body on an exhalation releasing any unnecessary tension or concern that lingers in your body begin to open your senses up to the world around you beginning with your ears start to become mindful of the quiet space that is around you and of any sounds that pass through this sense of stillness when opening the ears there is no need to search for noises or to label any sounds that arise simply observe whatever is going on around you through your sense of hearing [Music] [Music] [Music] become aware now of the physical space you reside in noticing the sensations of the surface beneath you of any cushions or blankets above or against you notice if there is any particular sensation of the air around you does it appear to be still or in flow is it cool warm or possibly neutral [Music] just allow your physical body and its capacity to feel the ground you deeper into this present moment [Music] [Music] I invite you now to move a little further into the body following the movement of air into your lungs tune in to the sensations of it as it enters and leaves you as the belly rises and as it falls [Music] without attempting to change the breath in any way allow it to carry you further into the experience of inner stillness even amidst its constant flow allow the physical body to settle reaching a point of complete ease and comfort if you feel is necessary to adjust your position in any way just move slowly and mindfully as you come into a place of deeper comfort [Music] take a moment now to observe the mind you might find that thoughts and associated feelings linger beneath the surface of an otherwise very still state if thoughts are present simply observe them from a place of compassion and non judgment just see if it's possible to observe them as an outsider without becoming consumed by the stories they tell and then return your attention to the breath [Music] at any point you can use the breath as a tool to draw you back into a present state of awareness when we draw our attention to the mind during meditation we might find that enchanting visuals accompany the stories we tell the point of this meditation is not to banish or look down upon this imagery that we create unconsciously meditation is simply a call to become more conscious and mindful of what is happening inside of our heads the mind is a powerful tool that can either entrap us in imagery informed by fear or that can be used to enhance our lives and create more positive beliefs ideas and dreams take a few moments now to practice being an outside observer of thoughts and imagery that appear in the mind simply become more attuned to the way that your thoughts give life to your visions knowing that you hold the power to turn your attention away from any storyline that is guided by fear worry or anxiety [Music] rather than force your thoughts to become something you might deem to be more positive take this time to let all thoughts dissolve continue to focus on the breath moving through you as you sink further and further away from mental distractions [Music] [Music] [Music] with each inhalation you might envision yourself being infiltrated with lightness peace and contentment and with each outward breath you can imagine that all negative and unconstructive thoughts and beliefs are being released allow yourself to become completely at ease within this present moment take another moment to feel into your physical body knowing that you are entirely supported in this moment physically emotionally and spiritually and that even through this simple act of slowing down you are beginning to invite more positive dreams into your evening sleep [Music] from this deep sense of underlying stillness I invite you now to use the power of your mind to enter a visual place of peace beauty and serenity there are no rules as to what this place should look like so long as it brings you a sense of inner peace the place you choose might be a beach a mountain range a lake or somewhere further afield perhaps somewhere far into outer space this is your vision take a few moments now to settle on your preferred location allowing it to enliven itself in your mind's eye [Music] [Music] commit your awareness to building this peaceful space in your mind allow it to expand naturally alongside your growing sense of inner tranquility build it using the blessing of all of your five senses tune into your sense of sight first allowing your visual sense to build this place of your truest dreams [Music] what colors and textures are present to the eyes other animals plants or other humans around you here [Music] what does the sky look like from where you look out what elements are present simply tuned into the visual presence of fire earth water and air if any or all of these are present allow your creation of this space to include your sense of sound is it completely silent where you are or are there subtle noises present possibly there's a recognizable beat or rhythm in any sounds that might be growing in this space or are the sounds disorderly like the unpredictable pitter-patter of rain [Music] simply allow that whatever brings you peace to arise in this place of beauty [Music] [Music] tuning in now to your sense of smell are there any recognizable aromas that are present here from the smell of salty water to fresh earth and autumn leaves allow nature's aromas to trickle into this imagery you are resting within and if nothing arises that is fine too there are no rules to what your mind creates so long as it brings you comfort [Music] consider your sense of taste now allowing your experience here to delight your taste buds as you explore this peaceful landscape is there anything that you feel compelled to taste you might want to indulge in wild berries in pure spring water or in some of a worldly treat born in outer space just allow your experience to be rich divine and fulfilling nourishing your entire being [Music] and as you explore this place either walking slowly through it or from a resting position allow yourself to feel into it through your physical body what nourishing surfaces does your body come into contact with [Music] how does the air feel against your skin [Music] thus the Sun or moon beam down on you filling you with a sense of ease and enchantment just allow whatever brings you deep peace to express itself here [Music] now I invite you now to tune into this place you have created with a sixth sense that is with your hearts feeling as you breathe and vision your heart expanding with each inhalation and softening with each exhalation with each breath allow your heart to open up to the piece you have just built within you let this space nourish your innermost being Oh heartedly take a few more moments to allow yourself to play rest or recharge in this beautiful and tranquil environment you have conjured use each of your senses including your heart to explore this moment as fully as possible [Music] in this very moment you feel a deep sense of care love and support granted to you by the universe by the beautiful space you have created and by your highest self and clearest mind [Music] everything in this space and time is exactly as it is meant to be and you feel highly attuned with all that is around you [Music] slowly I invite you now to gently release the imagery you have created letting go of the taste and texture and the sights and sounds [Music] gently release your vision of this beautiful place knowing that in some way on some other fjord of reality it is still very present within you [Music] even as the images fade away you maintain the heartfelt sensations this visualization opened you up to inside of you there is a deep sense of peace beauty and contentment [Music] come back now to the breath watching it flow gently and steadily through you [Music] as you return to this physical reality that you are in you begin to feel more grounded and present within your environment there is a deeper sense of that inner stillness you know is always within you so take a moment to draw your awareness through the body blessing the entirety of your physical being with deep rest and relaxation release any constriction in the belly the chest area soften and loosen the jaw release [Music] and your phorid allow the entire body to relax completely as you prepare to enter the dream world [Music] as you settle into a state very close to sleep little pieces of your peaceful paradise linger in the back of your mind unconsciously through the power of this visualization you have set the stage for beautiful dreams to carry you through the night ahead all tension worry and fear have melted away and in its place nothing but lightness and peace remains allow your breath to continue rocking you to sleep alongside each breath cycle you might silently repeat this following affirmation until slowly this awakens state drifts the way my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with beautiful visions keep your heart and mind wide open your body rooted in a sense of inner peace and harmony and allow the infinite possibilities for beauty to infiltrate your dreams continue whispering silently my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with [Music] beautiful visions until this wish becomes a slumbering reality [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this divinely inspired nighttime meditation it's a meditation designed to help you connect with three of your spirit guides and to then surrender effortlessly into sleep allow my voice to guide you through this journey opening your heart and the highest mind to the figures and messages that you are meant to encounter here so begin to soften your breath as we prepare for the otherworldly exploration before we begin I invite you to bring your body to a lying-down position that is entirely comfortable for you you may like put just your positioning with cushions and blankets warming and supporting yourself in any way you need just take a moment to gently scan the body releasing any constrictions you might come across perhaps in the belly the shoulders your neck or your furrowed softly invite the entire body to relax its posture as you open the chest gently take a few deep breaths here to settle into this position [Music] [Music] [Music] now draw your awareness to the physical body by tuning into your sense of touch without moving become more highly aware of the physical world that holds you notice the sensations present beneath your body at every inch of skin that is in contact with the surface below you [Music] expand your awareness by noting other physical sensations such as the way clothing or blankets feel against your body all the way the air around you touches your skin [Music] without judgment and without searching for anything simply practice opening your awareness to whatever the present state of your reality is draw your awareness deeper now tapping into a more visceral awareness of the physical body is it possible to observe any sensations or movements of energy within the cellular body can you sense the energetic body draw your awareness to your breath and begin to notice the way the outside world enters your inner world by the way of this life force observe any sensations that are present as you inhale and exhale notice if perhaps this awareness begins to dissolve the gap between the outer and inner world bringing you closer to a sense of harmony and balance feel yourself becoming more deeply connected to everything around you as you continue to breathe [Music] [Music] now tune in once again to the surface beneath you and imagine for a moment that there are sturdy roots beginning to grow from all the places that make contact with the earth feel these roots expanding permeating the surface beneath you and then slowly breaking through the rich dense soil beneath the earth's surface [Music] as you ground yourself into the physical world this way observe yourself being nourished by the nutrients and lifeforce that rise through these roots see if you can feel these roots feeding you supporting you and protecting you as you begin to feel more and more grounded in the space you are in gently allow this visual to dissolve knowing that the earth still supports you even without your attention held on it shift your attention now by drawing your awareness to the crown of your head feel into the lightness that is present here noticing perhaps a white or golden glow occupying the space where your mind and physical body meets the universe [Music] open your awareness to the invisible universal energies that permeate your being through your crown perhaps visualizing this descending energy as a golden thread as it enters your body this divine energy makes its way to every corner of your inner world inspiring and enlightening all aspects of your being rest in silence for a moment to observe this healing energy and lighten and inspire your entire being between the earthly energies and the cosmic ones you are now coming to witness your being as both human and divine both grounded and expansive just take one moment to observe this intermingling of the earthly in spiritual realms and then allow all visuals of this healing energy to disappear leaving behind a sense of deep connection to everything that exists around you [Music] awareness of the spiritual realm has now been unlocked you are open and nearly prepared for the journey you will soon make towards your spirit guides as we proceed with this movement into the spirit world I invite you to remember that you are always in control of this journey if at any point you feel uncomfortable or simply wishing to take your newfound knowledge back to your body you're always welcome to come back to the physical world by returning to your breath your breath is always available to anchor you to the present moment and will help guide you into a deep and restful sleep please know that you are entirely supported on this journey that the universe is offering unconditional love and support to you in this very moment just take a moment now to feel into this Universal energy by returning to your breath for a few moments of silence as you inhale feel your body and spirit being nourished with healing waves of energy and as you exhale feel yourself being cleared of all stagnant energy all fear all negativity and all that holds you back from your truest self open your heart to trust to healing and to awakening if thoughts arise at any point simply observe their presence and then gently release them as you come back to your breath and your awareness of the spirit world the crown has been opened and you are now prepared to meet with your spirit guides so let us slowly ascend to their realm with eyes remaining closed draw your awareness to the space between your brows this energetic region of the body often referred to as the third eye hold your capacity for higher perception it is the center of your intuition insight and wisdom just hold your attention here for just a moment and then slowly begin to envision a mystical and enchanted forest appearing within this space [Music] [Music] continue to breathe deeply as you visualized the trees shrubs vines and flowers begin to grow here expand your awareness to observe the insects that circulate through soil and air and the animals that call this place home allow this place to penetrate your soul enveloping you with a sense of peace and comfort and joy you to feel at home in this space so take your time to explore whatever is here [Music] out of the dense forest ahead of you you notice a pathway beginning to clear as if beckoning you to move deeper into the woods you feel safe and secure venturing that way so you begin to tread mindfully down the path notice the way the earth feels beneath your feet and the way the forest air feel was your lungs just ahead of you along the path you notice a bright white figure beginning to appear it is somewhat like a human form but is radiating in otherworldly energy [Music] deep in your bones you know that this is your first spirit guide you continue to move towards this spirits direction feeling drawn to whatever messages you are now sensing our present here take your time to observe this figure as you approach what energy does he or she exude what might he or she have to share [Music] finally you reach your spirit guide standing just before him or her you gaze into one another's eyes and through them your guide speaks listen closely to what is offered here without searching for anything simply open yourself to the teachings that are being offered open your heart as divine messages filter into your soul [Music] [Music] your guide extends his or her hand to you and you reach for it you sense there is another figure this spirit would like you to meet and so together you move further into the woods as you walk you are infused with your spirits energy becoming more empowered and inspired with each step that you take together see if you can feel all of your cells coming to life awakening to the truths that are being offered to you [Music] and once again you notice another beaming figure of light just ahead of you on this path take your time as you slowly move your way towards it observing whatever energies or characteristics are noticeable as you approach [Music] as you look into the eyes of this second spirit guide you feel a great sense of peace and calm come over you this spirit like the first speaks at a higher frequency than the earthly realm is accustomed to blessing you with this new inside take a few moments to rest with this spirit allowing the messages he or she offers to permeate your entire being [Music] now with each of these mystical spirits on either side of you you know that there is one final guide you are meant to meet on this journey the three of you continue walking slowly and mindfully through the dense and enchanted woods that surround you continue to breathe in the fresh forest air allowing it to reach all the way to the depths of your belly tune in once again to the textures and colors of the woods mindfully observing all the mystical creatures and plants that bring everlasting life to this place [Music] finally in the clearing ahead of you you see the third and final figure of light the spirit is glowing with arms stretched forward warmly you make your way towards this spirit feeling instantly renewed awakened and welcomed and as you finally meet this divine body of energy you reach your hands forward to meet theirs as you look into this third spirits eyes you are instantly filled with light peace love and clarity take a few moments to bathe in this experience allowing the highest message to come to you open your heart to whatever it is you need to hear right here right now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in this clearing within the woods you and your three spirit guides come to form a circle hand in hand take a moment to look towards the first who came to you sinking more deeply into the message he or she had offered you [Music] [Music] now shift your gaze to the second spirit you met remembering the bits of insights that were infused into your being upon your encounter [Music] and finally gaze into the eyes of the third and final spirit opening your heart to whatever was presented to you allow this final message to mingle for a few moments with your entire being [Music] take a moment to thank each of your spirit guides and then gently allow them to dissipate back into the air of these enchanted woods know that they have not left you but they are always always within [Music] gently allow the entire forest to melt away as you draw your awareness back to your physical body [Music] notice once again the feeling of the bed or other support system beneath you and then reconnect with your breath to help ground you back into this physical reality nestled into the cushions and blankets that are there around you allowing them to bring warmth to body and spirit [Music] the messages that were offered may continue to linger for a short time but soon I invite you to surrender them back to the universe for the night knowing that they are never very far away let all thoughts go as you come back down to this very moment in time there is nothing you need to witness in this moment aside from your body as it slowly surrenders into sleep the positive and powerful insights you have encountered will return tomorrow but for now allow the body heart mind and solve the risk deeply into the physical world with your spirit guides always around you you can rest with ease knowing that you are supported unconditionally throughout this lifetime allow the following affirmation to lull you to sleep repeating these words silently and softly as you inch closer and closer towards a restorative slumber the universe supports me the universe supports me the universe supports me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and thank you for tuning into this meditation this meditation comes at a time an exceptionally challenging time for us here in Australia as the wildfires have sparked overwhelming devastation fear uncertainty grief and despair with a situation as destructive as this one right before our very eyes it's hard to find a sense of peace safety and security in the earth beneath our feet even those who have seen the images footages and news from afar can sense a great loss that is occurring in this beautiful country humans pets plants animals property nothing is beyond the reach of these fires so wherever you are in the world I hope this meditation brings some sense of peace comfort as we move forward to get started I invite you to take a moment just to settle into this space either lying down or in a comfortable seated position and allow your belly to relax and the forit to soften as you simply arrive wherever you are my hopes are that you are far from danger in this moment and then you can find some sense of solidity in the earth beneath you right now so draw your attention to the breath and watching it as it flows into and out of your body [Music] and then see if you might invite the breath a little bit deeper relaxing your stomach as you welcome both body and mind to soften here [Music] now take a few moments to be mindful of any thoughts or any feelings any stories that are moving through your mind in this moment if you've been touched by fires in some way in Australia or any part of the world take a moment to honor whatever feelings and sensations are present for you and if you are somewhere else across the ocean and have been shaken by what you've seen in the media or heard from loved ones take a moment to also honor whatever has arisen within this meditation is not designed to make everything okay it is first meant to assist us in honoring the raw truth of our experience before guiding us into some sense of peace despite this tragic event now finish your next exhalation and then take a deep breath in and out a deep breath in once again and out and one more time while it's important to witness and honor whatever is within us we can continually bring ourselves back to the peace and safety of this present moment through awareness of the breath use the breath as your anchor anytime you need to reconnect with what is right here the fear and uncertainty of approaching fires the loss of homes of wildlife and animals a sense of hopelessness helplessness and disempowerment and the grief the anger the shock the desperation all of these are very real experiences that a meditation cannot make right in any tangible sense the very raw and heart-wrenching feelings that have been stirred are so deeply human the devastation is hard to put into words [Music] and so because of what is happening here and in other areas of the world we might feel as if someone or something is to blame now whether that be climate change politicians or humanity as a whole being able to point out a cause for this devastation can in some way feel consoling and yet anger blame and rage will not help us to find peace healing and a way for us to move forward and when we dig deeper we might tap into what is beneath our anger is there a sense of fear juda feeling unsupported unprotected or vulnerable is there a sense of despair for the suffering of animals wildlife and humanity [Music] whatever is moving through you I invite you to tune in to what is present in the body and can you observe and sit with these emotions as they manifest themselves in your physical being [Music] you might want to breathe energy into these areas of tightness tension or resistance naturally letting yourself soften into this meditation [Music] grounding through the breath little thoughts and stories come as they may and and watch them depart just as effortlessly with each out breath this might take some time so just practice compassion as these things work themselves through [Music] to explore this soft and compassionate witnessing I invite you to create a bit of distance between your thoughts and feelings and yourself as the observer of them see if you might approach your fears and concerns from a place of your highest itself as you watch what moves through consider can i nurture this part of me this part of the world that is suffering [Music] [Music] open your heart to yourself holding yourself exactly as you are in this moment and as we open up through this center of our being we can begin to find a greater sense of peace even amidst the heaviness that life can bring [Music] continue to breathe all the way into the base of the belly and all the way back out releasing just a fraction of discomfort resistance and any strong emotions with each and every breath [Music] now begin to imagine a white healing light penetrating from the top of your head inching ever so slowly down through the body with every body part that it passes feel your body gently opening up to a deeper release in a sense of bees [Music] allow the mind to soften beneath its glow your heart to expand and your belly to relax and your limbs to find softness and stillness while there may be residue of emotion and fear see if you can open yourself up to this moment of peace stillness and subtle healing can you allow yourself to be bathed in this white healing glow but these next few moments and now from this lighter softer space see if you might open your heart as you bring to mind the land the humans and the animals that are in need of your love and your prayers at this time you might envision strangers or perhaps someone you know and love you might envision farmland forests plants and animals or rows of homes you might envision the whole country or the whole world [Music] regardless of what comes to mind allow the images of these Souls to enter your mind from a place of love rather than fear hold the image of them in both mind and heart and sending love light and peace to all those affected [Music] as we allow our strongest emotions to come to pass and to soften opening up to our reality from a place of purpose and love we start to uncover ways we might be of benefit to ourselves to our loved ones our community and our shared humanity from sending prayers to sending support and supplies to helping in hands-on ways where possible let these devastating fires bring our shared humanity to the forefront encouraging us to love support and send peace to all those on this planet take a few moments of quiet space now to send prayers or loving thoughts to all those affected by these fires and to those affected by any other disaster that is shaking this world and those who call it home [Music] [Music] gently soften your mind of all thoughts or prayers and all best wishes as you come back to the natural rhythm of the breath allow each inhalation to open your heart to the love and healing that is possible and each exhalation free you of things that no longer serve you so that you may move through this world with hope and purpose and love whatever comes your way I send you my prayers and warmest of wishes allow the waves of life to move through you but to never hold you down for too long beneath the destruction and devastation there is hope for a new world of peace and love and beauty take your time to come out of this meditation trusting the process that leads you to renewed faith hope and healing and I send you many many blessings to you and your loved ones [Music] [Music]

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided nighttime meditation that is aimed to help you wind down both body and mind before sleep often times we get into bed with our heart set on getting a great night's sleep an overactive body or mind or both stand in the way of our achieving this deep relaxation that we yearned for so to address this challenge this meditation will help you to soften all of that interactivity and tension as you find yourself drifting naturally and gracefully into a sound sleep so before we begin I invite you to take a moment or two to ensure that all of your end-of-day activities are taken care of lights turned off alarms set if needed and anything else that might stand in the way of your fullest relaxation you can address this [Music] and once everything is taken care of just getting comfortable in your sleeping or lying down position your neck should be aligned with the spine and your arms and legs are free to fall and rest where they may and take a deep breath in now and out and allowing yourself to surrender a little bit into the surface beneath you take a moment here to simply acknowledge the present state of your mind [Music] without judging or evaluating or trying to change anything see if you might observe whatever thoughts or feelings are present from a place of subtle separation [Music] it doesn't need to be any attachment to whatever you were witnessing just a soft and compassionate acknowledgement of your present state of being [Music] now softly surrender is focused awareness as you shift your attention to the natural rhythm of your breath [Music] see if you can follow each inhalation and exhalation and mindfully observing whatever sensations are present you might notice the depth of your breath and its speed or rhythm [Music] but in any case see if you can accept your current state of being without trying to change it in any way [Music] and as you observe your breath you might notice it beginning to deepen and quite often when we draw our attention in a loving and non-judgmental way to the breath it begins to expand on its own you might observe the belly softening or the shoulders falling whatever your experience feels like is entirely welcome [Music] whether we are consciously aware of it or not our body and mind is connected so when there is tension in either body or mind it often impacts the well-being of the other aspect of ourselves sometimes we're not entirely aware of the tension we hold on to until we start to consciously release it so what we are going to do is we're going to move through a gentle though powerful practice of tension and release as you hear each body part mentioned I invite you to bring attention or tightness to this region and then to release it completely on your following breath out so to begin draw your attention down to your feet on your next in-breath curling them in and holding them tightly for a brief moment and on your next exhalation release this tension completely [Music] breathe slowly and mindfully in between body parts noticing the wave of relaxation that pervades the mind as we move through this practice now bring a tightness to both legs pulling them in and holding them just for a moment and release them on the exhalation perhaps relaxing more thoroughly through a deep sigh [Music] on your next breath in contract the space within your pelvis region and your backside holding for just a brief moment and then soften these areas on your exhalation and melting further into the surface that support you [Music] shifting your focus now up to your belly tightening your core muscles on your next inhalation Titan and as you exhale allow all the muscles here to relax completely feel a complete surrender in your core taking a few slow deep breaths into your belly now [Music] draw your attention now to your hands tightening them into fists on your next inhalation tighten and as you exhale allow your fingers and palms to soften completely [Music] on your next inhalation pull your arms into your sides squeezing and holding for just a moment and as you exhale allow them to surrender completely to gravity [Music] bring a subtle and inward pull to your shoulders and upper chest area on your next inhalation and tighten and relax these areas completely allowing the shoulders to fall back and the hard area to soften and expand [Music] now I invite you to focus on the muscles in your face tightening your jaw your cheeks your forehead but just a moment really tense really tighten and as you exhale allow all face muscles to soften completely let go [Music] lastly I invite you to tense your entire body or any particular region that you feel requires further release and hold here for just a moment as you observe the sensation of tension here on your next outward breath let the entire physical body go letting gravity nourish you as it holds you safely and comfortably on the bed or other service that supports you here [Music] just take a few moments of silence here to ground yourself through the breath once again subtly observing the underlying restful state of both body and mind [Music] [Music] [Music] if it feels more comfortable to sink into sleep in a different position you're welcome to shift your posture at any time and if or as you move positions just move slowly and mindfully embodying this peaceful state of being that you have transitioned into [Music] if any thoughts arise in the forefront of your mind attempting to pull you away from this inner peace continue observing these invisible movements of energy by silently whispering to yourself I see you and I release you I see you and I release you I see you and I release you [Music] [Music] [Music] now allowing all thoughts to be gently surrendered as they arise see if he can tune into the blank canvas that exists before the mind's eye and in this space begin to visualize yourself standing at the edge of a majestic lake the ancient pines that surround the shore the clouds that fill the sky and the subtle stars that begin to appear overhead as the night approaches [Music] each of these elements adds to the wonder of this space you are witnessing [Music] the waters are calm and clear mirroring the pink orange and fading blue sky above [Music] you feel equally peaceful silently whispering the beauty and radiance of this simple moment [Music] you stand firmly grounded on a rocky peninsula that slopes gently towards the water barefoot you feel into the cool rock beneath you kneeling deeply connected to and supported by the physical earth this connection you now hold with nature inspires you to seek more of this natural comfort in your waking life to return to this natural place whenever you seek clarity peace or release just to your right a narrow dark extends from the shore at the end of it a floating raft gently bobbles atop the still water [Music] as the Sun sets we begin to feel tired hoping to drift off beneath the stars that grow brighter and brighter as the sky darkens so you begin to slowly and mindfully make your way down the dock soon coming to reach the raft that floats at the end of it [Music] upon reaching the raft you notice that there are already cushions and blankets set up for you making yourself comfortable you come to rest here lying down gently beneath the stars overhead a gentle lapping of water beneath the raft lulls you closer and closer toward sleep [Music] as you listen to it the mind begins to fall away and your inner peace rises to the surface [Music] before drifting off however you take one long last look up towards the cosmos witnessing the stars here surrounded by the beauty and peace of this natural landscape it is enough to melt all worries and fears away [Music] all tensions are released from both body and mind as you develop a deep trust in the grander vision of life the Stars offer you this heightened perspective [Music] you close your eyes on even the stars now tuning into the sound and sensations observed here the water continues to lap beneath the raft and the subtle rocking makes you feel deeply connected to the water beneath you to the flow of life itself and to this unique and wonderful journey you are honored [Music] [Music] you return to your breath now witnessing the natural ebb and flow of this life force as it passes through your physical being [Music] on your next in breath just allow the heart and belly to expand completely and as you breathe out release any last traces of tension perhaps with a deep sigh to help you settle [Music] now gently allow the notion of this majestic lake to dissipate as you tune into your physical presence wherever you are notice the comfort and support of the surface beneath you the nourishment of the breath as it flows through you and the piece that is observable beneath the layers of your mind [Music] [Music] with nothing left to envision and nothing left to do you are ready to let the day come to an end so that another may arrive when you were well-rested letting everything go gently allow yourself to drift into a deep and steady slumber as you fall to sleep allow the following affirmations to fill your subconscious mind continuing to transform the inner world in positive and empowering ways [Music] I am safe grounded and secure [Music] I am

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this soothing guided meditation that will take you on a journey into the peace of the ocean gently guiding you towards a restorative and peaceful sleep during the course of this journey you will first come into contact with the peace that exists right here in the present moment before being guided to open yourself up to a deeper descent underwater all that is required of you now is a willingness to open yourself up to the possibility of complete inner harmony take a few grounding breaths now as we begin this exploration allowing your heart and chest to soften with each breath that you take [Music] now take a few moments to make any necessary adjustments to the physical body moving yourself in such a way to allow relaxation to flow effortlessly through your being if there is any tightness lingering around the chest or the stomach or your shoulders or any other part of your body quietly make note of this tension and then gently release it on the next breath out [Music] straighten your neck soften the area around your eyes as you consciously begin to release all physical tension you prepare yourself for the journey into deep release and peace [Music] now before we journey anywhere let's take some time to become more intimately aware of the environment around and within us begin by simply drawing your awareness to the physical body and each area of it that is in contact with the physical support beneath you you might notice the entire back side of your body being completely supported by the bed or the cushions or the blankets underneath you just take a moment to simply draw your attention to each area of contact here now consider areas of the body facing upwards towards the ceiling that are also in contact with the material world noticing items of comfort that might be draped over the top of you and then see if you can finally tuned in to the invisibility of air that surrounds your body noticing if you can feel it against your skin in these observations there is no need to search for some specific form of experience or result simply allow any arisings to be witnessed [Music] draw your attention now to the belly as you observe the way it rises and falls as you inhale and exhale [Music] even if sensations of the breath within a more subtle we can typically observe their presence in the form of movement once we draw our attention to this life force so allow the rest of the body to remain still as you focus for a few silent moments on the rising and falling of your core use your breath as an anchor when needed throughout this meditation even when you descend into the depths of the ocean in this visualization the breath is always available to provide you with grounding support and connection to this physical existence and if at any point the mind wanders becoming preoccupied with stories fears or judgments or chatter of any sort you can once again turn to the breath or to my words to refocus your attention it's entirely natural for our minds to wander so there is no need to condemn this tendency in any way when distractions occur simply take a deep breath refocus your attention and settle into this act of self-care once again as you watched the breath moving into and out of your body allow a sense of tranquility to overcome your entire being of seemingly paradoxical the breath is both like an anchor and like the waves they are one in the same as we learn to ride the waves of breath and of life we move towards the discovery of complete presence and stillness no matter how still we bring ourselves to be waves will still come just as the breath will still come movement is a part of life how we react to those movements is where we discover our power to maneuver ourselves in this world peacefully and calmly so before we descend into the ocean take a few moments of silence to effortlessly move with the rhythm of your breath the body will remain still while the present moment continually shifts sink into this peaceful movement for a short while now [Music] take this moment to tune into the space between the brows into the Mayans I allow all thoughts and images to melt away as you focus your attention solely on the empty space before you the world around and within becomes quiet as you prepare for a journey into the depths of the ocean upon this blank slate before your mind's eye begin to visualize yourself at the edge of the ocean your bare feet are nestled into the sand as you stare out the vast sea before you take a few moments to observe the sensations present what do your eyes notice you what sounds to your ears pickup what smells fill the air how does your body feel how does your heart feel as you begin to relax into this space eel the ocean air filling the entire cavity of your lungs as you inhale and then releasing all unnecessary stress and tension from your physical body as you exhale stare out at the open sea as you witness every knot and contraction dissolving [Music] you take a few steps forward so that as the waves brush up against the shore they cover your feet observe the natural rhythm of the waves steady though ever-changing just like the breath they continue to flow in and out in and out the ocean slowly becomes influenced by your breaths natural rhythm slowly coming to meet your own unique flow you start to feel yourself to be in total harmony with the vast abyss in front of you something inside of you whispers view to venture into the water so you start to move slowly and gracefully forward step by step you wade out until soon your calves are submerged and then your knees your thighs and your waist you stand waist-deep as you prepare to dive below [Music] stretching your arms out before you you take a deep breath a small jump and then dive forward with grace and these you are now completely submerged as you glide through the water extending both arm fords and then swooping them out to the sides to propel you further you notice that by divine magic you are able to breathe beneath the water small gills have developed and you come to realize that you are neither of this world nor the human one you are otherworldly a great wave of relief washes over you as you realize you had been yearning to explore this underwater palace with ease you continue to breast to stroke your way through the ocean feeling completely safe and accepted within this new kingdom [Music] you absorb every new side every color texture and shape of the sea life you pass [Music] seahorses brightly striped fish and even small shark swim around you none of them posing any threat to you in this magical environment you breathe naturally and effortlessly underwater your body feels light and free completely supported with each and every movement you make with every drop of water that soon passes over your body old stories and detachments are released soon nothing remains but a sense of oneness you are aligned with the oceans movements gliding with grace now something appears to be approaching you from straight ahead though you cannot make out what the creature is your intuition tells you it is not threatening the pair of eyes move closer and closer until very soon you know the figure to be a dolphin that is making its way toward you the dolphin slows as she approaches stilling herself just a few feet ahead of you you too have ceased movement now floating effortlessly in the open abyss of the great sea both pairs of eyes meet as you take a few silent moments of pure awareness here you can sense that your energies are in harmony and that you have attracted one another for a reason [Music] though the dolphin speaks a different language in sound the vibrations relay her message she reminds you that it is possible to be both compassionate and gentle while harnessing a deep and authentic source of inner strength when embodying these two principles the way dolphins do body and mind relax completely knowing that the paradoxes in life do not have to bring strife strength and compassion can co-exist they can be one in the same the dolphin breaks her gaze as she swims off to the side and begins to swim playful circles around you she sings out to the sea reminding you that it is okay to lighten up to play and to be who you really are as she sings you feel her vibrations radiating into the core of your being in this moment you know you are forever changed for the better balance and harmony have now made their way into your burns rather than remaining an idea digested by mind alone [Music] the dolphin slows and comes back for one more brief moment to gaze into your eyes a subtle smile overcomes her face before she flutters away disappearing into the darkness ahead of you you breathe deeply feeling her still very much present within you [Music] she has blessed you with a wisdom and the gifts gifts that now live within you you look above and notice you are not too far from the surface of the ocean the sunlight trickles in to remind you to come back to the human world though you have enjoyed your time in the depths of the ocean you know you must now return as you swim slowly and calmly up towards the light you feel every last grain of tension fall from your body sinking down to the ocean floor to be renewed you feel light and free having no remaining weightiness in your body or mind as you break through the barrier of water that opens up to the open sky your gills disappear and you notice what it is like to breathe like a human once again floating on your back you take a few deep breaths into the belly feeling a sense of calm filling you completely [Music] visuals of the ocean begin to disappear from your mind's eye as you tune in once again to the support and strength of the physical world beneath your body though the ocean and a dolphin are now behind you they are forever within your heart and spirit allow this earthly world to support you once again the feeling of peace freedom and calmness that the underwater world blessed you are still within you you will carry them into sleep as you surrender effortlessly into the coming slumber [Music] follow your breath acknowledging it to be both wave and anchor as you melt into this present moment completely welcoming another restorative night's sleep there is nothing left to do but to grant your body in mind permission to release themselves for another night follow your breath now in silence allowing it to guide you into a deep and peaceful sleep [Music] welcome to this guided meditation which is designed to help you slow your racing mind and then lead you gently into a soothing and restorative sleep over the next little while I invite you to simply follow my voice as you come to experience a profound sense of silence within take a few deep breaths now to settle yourself into this space and soon and we will begin it is not uncommon within our fast-paced modern lifestyle for the mine to be on constant overdrive even when we bring the body to rest mental chatter often persists one of the primary reasons that we have trouble easing our way into sleep is because of this feverish side of the mind whether it is caught up in the past events or is living 20 steps into the future the mind has a way of pulling us out of the present moment it keeps us stimulated and engaged even when we want to try to slow down when the mind is constantly on the go deep rest is put on hold before we begin navigating this side of the mind exposing it in such a way that calms and soothes it let us take a few moments to come into a comfortable lying down position and just taking your time to stretch and release the body in any way that feels restorative and to adjust your positioning with cushions or blankets as you require and once you are settled see if it is possible to straighten the neck if it is curved at all bringing a gentle oneness across the chest breathing in and exhaling [Music] grounding yourself into the physical space beneath and around you so take some time now to really connect with your breath becoming intimate with the way it passes through you as you inhale observe every sensation as the air trickles in first entering your nasal cavity passing through the trachea and then settling into the depths of your lungs and as you breathe out observe the moment in Reverse as your breath returns to the world around you notice your breaths rhythm and depth [Music] without changing it in any way for the time being simply observe its flow noticing where it extends to and how fast or slow it moves as we move through this meditation remember that your breath is always available to help anchor you in this present moment if distracting thoughts arise which they will allow the breath to guide you back down to your body to your direct experience of the now [Music] take a moment now to simply draw your attention to your stomach notice the way the belly moves as you breathe rising and falling throughout the cycle of your breath as you draw your attention to this area of the body you might notice that the breath naturally deepens if so open yourself to this consciously release any constriction in the abdomen to help guide the flow of air deep into the belly [Music] when how Mayans run uncontrollably our bodies assume a state of stress engaging a defense mechanism known as the fight-or-flight response when the body is engaged in this way the breath loses its depth hovering in the more shallow cavities of the lungs hormone surge as the body prepares to defend itself in order to counterbalance this surge of stress hormones and to soften the reaction within the body we can engage in what is known as the relaxation response to help the body and mind to slow down by consciously drawing the breath into the belly we invite this counter response to take over easing the racing thoughts that stimulate the physical body take a few moments of silence now to deepen the breath in this way guiding it into the fullest capacity of the lungs so that it presses into the abdomen if you find it challenging at first to deepen your breath all the way this is entirely okay over time the breath will soften and the lungs will expand for now just see how far the breath is capable of going as you slowly breathe in and slowly breathe out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thoughts may continue to rise from time to time but there is no need to panic or self judge if they do the mind may attempt to add fuel to the fire by criticizing telling the self that it should not be thinking refrain from giving in to this common reaction reminding yourself that is natural for thoughts to arise and then compassionately releasing whatever has come up [Music] [Music] thinking is a natural function of the mind and as such it cannot be forced to cease entirely however we can begin to expose our racing thoughts by observing them from a new place and with the fresh lens as we uncover their nature we begin to distance ourselves from them and from the stories that they spin so now I invite you to open your heart to the truth that you are not your thoughts take a few breaths here on your own repeating the following words in silence I am NOT my thoughts I am NOT my thoughts allow yourself to open wholeheartedly to the truth that your thoughts do not define you [Music] [Music] notice the way that the mind can be redirected in such a way flowing alongside your attention it can take time to catch the mind when it escapes but we continued practice it is possible to refocus again and again on the direct experience within this present moment any time the mind wanders simply acknowledge its movement with compassion and curiosity there is no reason to criticize or condemn the uprising of thought instead practice observing the inner dialog from a distance when you notice yourself becoming entangled in the minds story simply notice what has happened and draw your attention back to your breath [Music] continue to follow each inhale and each exhale as you continually re-establish yourself in the present moment [Music] [Music] it is possible to further de-escalate the power of your thoughts by beginning to label them whenever they arise this sort of labeling should not be based in judgment such as being defined by words such as good or bad or spiritual or an spiritual rather rising thoughts can be observed according to the action that they represent for instance you may assign certain words to your thoughts such as thinking planning denying criticizing or worrying after you label thoughts in this way allow the wave to disappear and then return to your breath [Music] practice this again rooting yourself through the breath and becoming more aware of the nature of your thoughts not of their content witness the way they move and the nature of these movements [Music] [Music] other actions you might notice include hoping feeling dreaming and arguing continue to quietly observe whatever arises coming back to your breath in between rising thoughts [Music] you you you might also observe physical sensations labeling them as pressure softness tingling or warmth continue to notice whatever you notice allowing single words to disengage and trancing stories [Music] [Music] [Music] continue to come back to the natural rhythm of your breath in between observations breathing in breathing out continually refocusing your attention on this innate flow now let whole words and thoughts subside as you come deeper into the physical sensations of the body take a moment to scan the body gently drawing your awareness first your toes before very slowly moving upwards throughout the visceral body and as you pass each area allow that part of the body to soften by simply focusing on a particular area and by using the power of your attention to release all of the associated muscles the physical body relaxes and the mind relaxes even further alongside it [Music] continue to work your way up slowly releasing or constriction and tension that is held within the body breathe into each body part blessing your physical being with love and compassion [Music] when you reach the head area pay special attention to the jaw to the eyebrows and to the forehead allow each of these muscle groups to relax observing the difference between felt contraction and release now draw your attention now to the space between your brows to what is often referred to as the third eye area and as you hold your attention on this spot consciously keep the muscles around it relaxed and breathe into this space for just a few breaths noticing any sensations or visuals that might be present now gently envision a light blue glow beginning to appear in this space it is soft and soothing gently pulsating in this space between your eyebrows and as it expands it touches every cell of the mind space dissolving all thoughts as it pulses [Music] you might notice yourself beginning to feel quiet tired finally feeling free of your thought waves and feeling ready to relax deeply you might also like to feel into this release through a deep sigh exhaling all tension out of the body until nothing remains in your attention aside from this healing blue light [Music] once all thoughts have been dissolved this orb of energy begins to shrink but not disappearing entirely now this soft blue glow appears as a pearl pristine clear and sparkling it hovers in the space between the brows for another moment and you come to witness a deep and profound silence within its presence sit with this silence for a few moments observing the peace and tranquility this pearl of light has brought to your inner being [Music] [Music] the soft Paul begins to descend moving very slowly until it reaches the throat and then floating a little further still until it lands in the heart it pauses here bringing its energy of stillness and tranquility to the heart space all is silent now or has been brought to peace [Music] [Music] the work of this blue light is now complete and so very slowly it dissipates into nothingness you feel complete serenity in this very moment knowing that you have been freed of all racing thoughts the mind is at peace the heart is at peace and your body is at peace [Music] continue to breathe as you begin your final descent into sleep allow the natural rhythm of your breath the slow and steady waves of each cycle to gently guide you into restorative slumber the world within you and around you is quiet any subtle sounds begin to fade away as you slowly transition into a deep and peaceful sleep inhale and exhale slowly deeply until very soon this waking day has faded away [Music] [Music] welcome to this guided morning meditation as you slowly awaken this morning this meditation will gently guide you into a natural embrace of the day ahead before we begin I invite you to come into a comfortable position whether that sitting or lying down ensure that the spine is straight your shoulders are relaxed and the neck should be aligned with the spine all muscles gently relaxed so just take a moment to adjust yourself in any way necessary just to ensure you are comfortable and supported and when you are ready allowing your eyes to gently close to begin this meditation simply come to notice your breath without trying to change it without judgment or assessment and you simply notice the nature of it witness the way it effortlessly moves into the body and then back out [Music] just become attuned to the natural flow of the breath as though observing the breath the full length of each breath in and out [Music] [Music] as you begin to settle take a moment to witness the entirety of your body and mind our thoughts often when we wake we carry fragments of our dreams and we hold on to thoughts about the days behind and the days ahead of us so simply begin to observe from a place of non-attachment but ever you may be carrying in the physical body [Music] just gently witnessing any areas of tension or discomfort and invite your breath to nurture these areas take a few deep breaths into each area of the body calling for your attention and then gently release them [Music] allow your body to sink for a moment into complete stillness and silence [Music] [Music] [Music] in the same way now draw your attention to anything arising in the mind now there is no need to search for anything simply observe yourself open up to the thoughts that may be pre-existing or as they make themselves known just witness the nature of them and in the same way release them knowing that they are simply intangible ideas about what has come or what may be to come as you do this naturally notice yourself sinking further into this present moment sinking deeply into this waking day [Music] [Music] whatever ideas you have about the day ahead I invite you to set them aside a short while as you explore the moment you are presently in just notice through the physical body the surface that support you the chair you are seated on or the mattress you are lying on might be the floor quietly observe any sounds or physical sensations around you both strong or subtle [Music] and through your closed eyes notice if there's any sense of sunlight trickling in or shadows dancing behind your closed eyes [Music] as you come to mindfully explore the world around you there is silence and stillness begin to make note of the presence of day just continue to allow the breath to guide you through this gentle awakening of the senses noticing how you are inextricably linked through the breath to the world outside of you allow each in-breath to nourish you and each breath out to free you of any constriction fatigue or even thoughts that may be lingering [Music] allow yourself to be nourished through the breath as you open your heart to this new day [Music] I invite you now to draw your awareness to your belly and as you do watch the way the breath flows in through your chest filling the entirety of your lungs and causes the stomach to expand to rise and you might witness an expansion of the chest area as well an opening up of the heart space [Music] [Music] if the mind wanders continue to simply invited back down and into the physical body the day ahead will wait for now simply embrace and enjoy these quiet moments of stillness presence and awareness allowing yourself to tune into the energy of a gentle a natural expansion that comes with sunrise [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now from this place of complete awareness and presence begin to tune into the heart space drawing your awareness to the center of the chest and allow your heart to expand that has it expands envision it touching all possibilities for the day ahead you might envision a white or a golden light radiating out from the heart making contact with the future that is continually unfolding if you find any anxious or fearful thoughts arise just witness them without becoming attached to them and gently focus back into your heart space or into the golden light radiating from this space within you [Music] focusing now on your highest potential and visions for the day it might be goals that you want to achieve things that you want to set out to do all you need to do and allow any cluttering or limiting thoughts to naturally fall away and there is no need to force anything out of existence or to judge or condemn anything that might be arising if anything less than your highest potential arises simply notice it acknowledge it and allow it to dissipate whatever we envision on a regular basis we start to manifest in the outer world consciously reflect for a moment on whatever it is your highest self wishes to manifest in your life or more specifically in the day ahead what is the deepest yearning of your heart [Music] what is the energy you wish to carry with you throughout your day continuing to feel into the hearts glow and compassionately allowing conflicting mental chatter to subside as a higher truth reveals itself begin to narrow in on what is it you wish to manifest considering for a moment that you already hold whatever it is you may take a few moments to breathe into this feeling as if it is already present within you allow your thoughts to be clear and conscious stemming from the core of who you are you might like to consider in the words of Rumi what you seek is seeking you [Music] just allow the openness of your heart to hold the truth that whatever you hope to embody is already here it is already present within you [Music] [Music] just coming back to the body now and taking in a few more grounding breaths before setting a powerful intention for the day ahead allow yourself to be completely here knowing that in truth there is no where you need to go and nothing you need to achieve as we increase our ability to be fully present you might find limiting thoughts begin to fall away and you begin to embody more deeply the truth of who you are take three silent and steady breaths here routing yourself in the expanding energy of this morning you so from this place of pure presence I invite you now to set one more clear and powerful intention for your day consider whatever it is you wish to embody and state it to yourself as if it were already here for instance if you are longing is for self confidence and esteem consider a phrase such as I am confident and complete or if the stability and safety are of your highest concern perhaps an affirmation like all of my deepest needs are being met just allow yourself to become very clear and focused on your intention as you begin to repeat it to yourself with each full breath so take a few moments of silence here as you align your intention with your breath letting the words fill you up entirely again and again but just a few moments [Music] [Music] so wherever you are now resting come to notice once again with eyes closed environment around you feel into the physical support of the ground beneath you of the material world it has been manifested around you [Music] see if you can notice the air of the room that you are currently in and he sounds near or far [Music] and take three more full breaths here knowing that you are unconditionally supported in this journey gently begin to soften the area around the eyes and when you are ready slowly open them up to the world around you noticing the delicate transition from dark to light as you move forward in outward action continually come back to the intention you are carrying within you knowing that the universe is here to support guide and nourish you with every step that you take [Music] welcome to this guided meditation designed to help you ease into a deep and peaceful sleep while lowering your blood pressure naturally and effectively through mindfulness conscious breathing and deep body visualizations this meditation will create an inner experience of relaxation as well as guide the heart towards a healthy smooth and steady rhythm over the next short while allow my voice to guide you into this deep state of relaxation knowing that the hearts flow will follow suit as you sing further into stillness take some time now to settle into a comfortable lying down position using any blankets and cushions to support your body where needed if possible on the spine and neck should be in line to help open the flow of energy through the entire body tune into your entire body now as you make any final adjustments that will support your progression into a deeply relaxed and peaceful state I invite you now to simply bring your attention to your breath without trying to shift it in any way just gently open your awareness to it observing its natural flow rhythm and depth [Music] [Music] notice the way the breath comes and goes on its own accord guided by an innate wisdom that does not require any effort on your part it simply comes and goes just as the ocean eps and flows [Music] [Music] as you draw awareness to the breath notice if it naturally shifts in any way again there is no need to intervene or manipulate its rhythm but you may find that as you tune into the breath it might naturally deepen slow down or adjust itself in some other way just notice if this is true for you and also notice if it is not there is no right or wrong way to notice the breath simply observe at however it comes and follow it wherever it flows [Music] [Music] throughout this meditation the mind may entangle itself in thoughts of the past or in visions of what might come to be if for when it does simply acknowledge this tendency as a movement away from this present moment before drawing your attention back to the breath if thoughts arise simply witness them for a moment with compassion and non judgment before returning to your unchangeable center no matter how frequently they crop up no that is entirely normal for thoughts to rise and entirely possible to gently let them go use the breath as your anchor at any point during this meditation to reground yourself in the physical place that you rest you [Music] draw your awareness now to the stomach noticing its natural rise and fall as breath moves through you in our busy day to day activities we often breathe primarily from the chest restricting our breaths range of movement this shallow breathing engages our stress response and releases a surge of hormones that temporarily increase our blood pressure as we naturally expand the breaths movement moving it effortlessly into the stomach we activate the relaxation response this deeper breathing pauses out of an inner state of stress and helps us to sink effortlessly into stillness and soon into a state of deep sleep continue to focus your attention on the stomach noticing just how far the breath can go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] take a moment now to acknowledge this physical place you are in without engaging the Mayans analytic capacity is it possible to simply witness the space you occupy to witness the physical world you are intimately connected to [Music] notice the surface that supports you and notice any soft textures around you [Music] draw your awareness to this very simple moment knowing that there is nowhere else you need to be you are nowhere else but right here right now and all that is asked of you is that you open your heart and awareness to this beautiful moment before you fall into a deep and restorative sleep [Music] [Music] as you notice your physical surrounds you may also become more deeply aware of your physical body maintain awareness of the breath flowing through you as you begin to scan the body gently starting at the toes and traveling up to the crown of your head [Music] [Music] there is nothing you need to look for in this process he was simply called to witness whatever exists within you [Music] if any tension or discomfort appears in your awareness simply embrace it with your loving awareness and open your breath up to this area that is calling for your tender love and air [Music] if there are no strong sensations to notice simply grant your entire body with your compassionate attention and let it melt further into stillness [Music] [Music] [Music] feel entirely free to also make any physical adjustments to your positioning that will help to provide you with more comfort if you adjust yourself at any point during this meditation simply do so mindfully and slowly to help foster this growing sense of peace and serenity inhale as you make any movements and exhale deeply as you settle into any new positioning [Music] [Music] hold your physical body in your awareness now as you begin to envision it's sinking deeper and deeper into the surface beneath you or tension is invited to melt away and all muscles are invited to relax completely with each inhalation you are infused with the greatest sense of relaxation and with each exhalation you release any lingering knots of tension or stress [Music] just take a few deep breaths here [Music] envisioning this process that is moving through you inhale relaxation and exhale any remaining tension in the body or mind [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I invite you now to draw your awareness to the heart space and to invite your breath into it breathe slowly and steadily here filling the heart completely on each inhalation and softening it on each exhalation [Music] come to notice the steadiness of the heart space it's slow flow and its openness as you breathe you bring the heart into greater harmony and equilibrium [Music] to slow down even more and to further this process of relaxation begin to add counts of four to your breath on your next inhalation breathe in to a slow count of four pause for a brief moment at the top and then exhale for a full count of four take three full breath cycles here following this guidance if it feels comfortable to you [Music] envision the heart slowing in space [Music] envision it relaxing completely into this moment it is beating naturally and effortlessly without you needing to intervene in any way simply by slowing the breath the heart follows suit simply by engaging in mindful breathing mind body and heart all come closer to complete relaxation [Music] as you settle into a sense of the heart beating slowly and steadily start to expand your field of awareness by imagining the pathways that flow into and away from the heart envision the life force that travels through your heart pumping smoothly and effortlessly this life force your blood nourishes your cells as it flows steadily through your body know that without any effort without any force or manipulation the body is nourishing itself in this very moment open your heart a little bit further with each full breath knowing that you are being supported by the body's innate wisdom right now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] continued to expand the breath envisioning and traveling throughout the entire body where attention goes energy flows as you expand your awareness to encompass the entire physical body life force in all its forms follow in that direction [Music] watching the breath flow steadily know that your blood is traveling in the same manner effortlessly extensively and wholeheartedly as you sink further into stillness trusting the body's wisdom the heart continues to beat slowly and steadily without any effort required on your part there is nothing you need to do and nothing you need to fix in this very moment your body is in harmonious flow [Music] [Music] begin to gently release everything held in the mind any visions thoughts or any mental chatter that may have crept up release it all on your next exhalation as you let go gently imagine the mind dropping down to the heart space slowly unfastening itself from the head space passing through the space between your brows down the nose through mouth and throat and landing softly in the heart without creating any visions thoughts or feelings of what this looks like simply hold your awareness in the heart and explore what it feels like to be in this space continue to breathe deeply through the heart [Music] [Music] in a moment we will enter into a few moments of silence you may choose to retain your breath as your anchor and focus for these moments or if it suits you you may introduce the following information on each inhalation as we sing into silence you may quietly repeat yourself I am flowing and on each exhalation you may repeat I am releasing I am flowing I am releasing I am flowing I am releasing invite this affirmation into your heart now or simply continue to breathe from the heart with your awareness focused on your breath [Music] [Music] [Music] now gently release the affirmation if it is currently passing through you with each breath and come back to the steady rhythm of your heart exactly as it is [Music] let go of all effort all focus and any visions that may still be moving through you as you come quietly into pure beingness as you slowly drift into sleep there is nothing you need to carry with you so begin to shed any remaining thoughts now simply practice for a few more moments this art of pure being you [Music] you let each part of the body soften as you allow this physical space to support your journey into sleep [Music] allow the gentle flow of music to rock you into a deep slumber until you finally come to sleep for the night [Music] continue to breathe deeply and slowly allowing your breath to guide your hearts flow and to guide you into a state of tranquility know that the body's wisdom will continue to support and nourish you throughout the night and that you were deeply supported by the energy flow that makes this life possible [Music] welcome to this powerful guided meditation this mindfulness meditation and visualization will lead you with compassion and curiosity deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation and then into the past before eventually carrying you into a deep and peaceful sleep I invite you to open your heart to this journey to whatever reveals itself knowing that you are unconditionally supported in each and every moment that passes allow the mind to rest aside as we move backwards through time there is nothing you will need to actively search for and nothing you'll need to find images and inner sensations may come for you but you will not need to control them and epilate them or force them in any way simply allow yourself to open up entirely to whatever moves through you as we take this journey allow this meditation in each moment to naturally reveal itself as you move deeper and deeper into the past so before we begin take a moment or two to come into a comfortable lying down position and sure that you feel safe and secure wherever you are ensure that your neck is aligned with the spine and your shoulders are relaxed take a moment to consciously release all muscles as you sink further into this supportive surface beneath you take a few deep breaths here grounding yourself in this present moment use your breath to guide you towards a place of complete stillness [Music] although we will be moving through the expansive field of time you can always ground yourself back into the present moment if you feel uncomfortable at any point you are in complete control of this journey so if any images or sensations arise that are too challenging for you to present Lee look at simply use your breath to anchor yourself back into the present moment you are always always in control of your journey with that said if any challenging images arise or if the experience becomes heavy you are also in an entirely safe domain to explore them images that arise in our consciousness can never hurt us they are solely tools or teachers that hold the potential to guide us forward in powerful and positive ways know that you are universally supported in each and every moment now take a moment to come back to your body notice your sense of touch through the way the surfaces around you make contact with your physical body feel into the textures that are present without moving noting how they feel as they rest against your skin consider the deeper levels of the physical body is it possible to become mindful of the cellular world notice your muscles and then invite them to relax encouraging them to sink further into the surface beneath you now consider the presence of air around your body and then gently follow it as it moves within filling your lungs fully as you take a breath in and returning to the world around you on your exhale allow the breath to become slow and steady just like the subtle lapping of waves against the shoreline [Music] take a few breaths on your own here following the innate rhythm of this life force that supports you [Music] allow yourself to come into a state of relaxation by drawing your breath to the heart space as you inhale allow your heart to expand filling itself to the outer edges with peace joy and clarity [Music] and as you exhale allow the walls of the heart to soften releasing any tension that may be stored there [Music] continue to breathe this way for a few more rounds effortlessly quietening the mind as you move closer and closer towards the true state of your heart [Music] [Music] [Music] begin to notice a growing sense of peace and tranquility as you become more attuned with the ever unfolding present moment in just a few moments we will begin our regression into the past allow your imagination to enrich your visions as you move further and further into the mystical landscape we are about to enter [Music] for just a few moments allow the space before your third eye to empty completely you may still see various colors and swirls of energy passing before you there is no need to change or attempt to control this instead see if you can simply observe whatever is present there just in front of your closed eyes you don't have to judge it or attempt to change it in any way simply notice the space that quietly and safely hold you in complete stillness in just a moment you will sink as far into relaxation as is required for your personal present moment and needs simply follow my voice as I count down guiding you deeper and deeper into a state of all-encompassing peace and tranquility 10 you are feeling safe and secure embraced by this open space 9 all stress and tension is being released with every breath you take 8 you are feeling heavy nourished by the energy around you 7 you are releasing even further 6 every muscle is relaxed 5 you are completely comfortable to let go for sinking further and further 3 the mind is quiet unless you have come to relax completely - you breathe slowly deeply and effortlessly and one you have arrived completely at peace completely relaxed [Music] all is quiet or is at peace now something starts to appear before your eyes out of the vast empty space before you you notice a mist developing it is airy and then chanted somehow beckoning you closer you take a few steps towards this mist very slowly and mindfully and as you approach it begins to dissipate as it slowly clears you begin to see there is a bridge ahead of you covered in moss and vines you make your way towards it mindfully treading on the pressed earth beneath your feet and as you cross over everything you ever knew begins to disappear all thought all attachments all fears and all worries you are entering into a new world into a different time with every step you take you inch closer towards the space and time just on the other side of the bridge it is a place that feels familiar somehow but one that your conscious mind cannot put any memory to the mist continues to clear and you realize you are within a dense majestic forest you feel at home you feel at peace here he reached the other side of the bridge and with the mist having vanished completely now you take a closer look at the scenery around you notice the colors and textures of this vibrant forest consider the way the earth feels beneath your feet you heighten your awareness of the aroma that awakens as you inhale deeply allow this place to nurture the deep sense of peace that is within you you walk forward ever so slightly as you noticed something peeking through from within the trees and as you approach you realize there is a cabin hidden within these woods and somehow you sense that it is or was your own you instantly remember it perhaps becoming flooded with visions of what it was once like in your own time you reach the front door and enter take a few moments to witness the visuals that are arising what does the cabin look like what happened here once upon a time who is with you imagery may come slowly and subtly simply allow them to arise in their own time allow your imagination and intuition to expand quite effortlessly mindfully consider what was once here that no longer remains [Music] you you remain open to whatever arises there is no need to fear the past it no longer has any control over you simply allow yourself to become the outside observer of whatever you feel has happened here watch this film play out as if you are a viewer rather than the character at center stage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] continue to breathe deeply as you simply observe whatever is present without judgment to our condemnation [Music] [Music] as we move through this time we shed old ways of being in order to make room for more expansive ones mindfully begin to consider what messages or lessons are being shared through these images that are arising what is there to be learned what is there to shed allow the mind to remain quiet as your intuition arises tune in with your heart opening yourself to the possibility of transformation [Music] return to your breath and to the aroma of the woods take a few more moments to witness whatever once happened at this beautiful cabin in the forest [Music] and slowly in your own time returned to the bridge slowly crossing back over as you return to the present physical reality you passed through the mist once more making your way to the other side 10 you are breathing deeply 9 you feel inspired and uplifted by what you have learned 8 you are calm and relaxed 7 your breath flows as steady as gentle waves caressing the shore 6 the past fading now 5 you feel deeply connected to the physical world for you exhale deeply letting everything melt away [Music] three you feel gratitude for the present reality you are in two you know that you are whole and complete in this very moment one you have arrived you are home once again you are at peace [Music] with the past now behind you you feel deeply settled within this present moment you know that the past cannot be changed but that it provides opportunity for growth and expansion everything you witnessed now dissipates just as the mist did as you crossed over and into the past you are still and silent and for the moment nothing remains to be seen you continue to allow positive and empowering lessons to reach you as you transition into a sleeping state but you are not in search of anything you are ready to rest easy for the entire night ahead dozing off swiftly and soundly take a few more breaths mindfully inhaling peace contentment and freedom and exhaling everything whatever once was [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the only place that truly exists is this very moment everything that once was can be used as a tool for self-realization at some future moment but for now allow your breath to gently rock you to sleep allow yourself to be nourished throughout the night ahead repeat the following words to yourself in silence as you gently fall into a deep slumber I am at home I am supported I am at peace I am home I am supported I am at peace I am home I am supported I am at peace I sleep deeply and with ease I sleep deeply and with ease tonight I choose to sleep in peace tonight I choose to sleep in peace I

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation as you prepare for a deep and nourishing sleep this meditation will guide you into manifesting a beautiful and loving relationship of your highest dreams one that is in alignment with your truest self the relationship that you come to manifest will be aligned with your own unique needs and personal journey perhaps it is a romantic partner you are currently attracting or a deeper friendship of some other form regardless of what your heart most deeply yearns for this meditation will help you to manifest that relationship upon a foundation of trust allowing you to rest easy and sing into a deep and enriching sleep [Music] so before we begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable using any desired cushions or blankets for support and warmth and adjust your body so that it rests comfortably allow the body to move itself so that any physical or tension or tightness can begin the process of release so just prepare yourself and your environment in any way necessary so that this day may be left behind set any alarms now and turn off all lights if your mind and body a moment to sink into this place and time exactly as it is knowing that there is nothing more to do or to be taken care of [Music] now take a moment to connect with your breath without trying to change it or manipulate it in any way I invite you to simply become aware of its natural flow our breath carries an innate wisdom of its own and does not need to be altered in any way while it is sometimes beneficial to deepen or direct the breath in certain manners for right now I invite you to simply be very present with the natural state of your being [Music] there may be aspects of the day that linger in your mind or there may be thoughts about tomorrow if any of these sorts of thoughts exist within you simply witness them acknowledging that they are not required in this very moment remind yourself that there is nothing to be done here and now all that is required of you is deep presence with your breath and with this moment [Music] [Music] [Music] draw your attention now to the hard space as you breathe allow the heart to gently expand with each inhalation and gently soften with each exhalation take a few silent breaths here from your heart center as you begin to soften its walls and open to the endless possibilities of love and deep connection love is abundant its presence is everywhere and as you sink further into this meditation you will begin to touch the truth that love exists all around and within each of us [Music] you are invited now to cultivate an awareness of and an appreciation for your innate radiance beauty and divinity [Music] in order to manifest and outer love it is necessary to first acknowledge the inner one complete and perfect in and of itself if any thoughts arise attempting to intervene with your experience of self-love simply witness them and then allow these thoughts to gently melt away as swiftly as they came [Music] take a few moments right now to gently introduce the words I am made of love I am made of love I am made of love just allow these words to flow into the heart space with each breath allow them to soften the heart further dissolving any preconceived notions that may stand in their way [Music] it may not come easily to self love it may trigger a rising resistance and know that if this is the case this too is okay know that any resistance does not make the truth of your innate beauty and radiance less valid resistance that arises is simply born of prior conditioning that has led us to forget the truth that we are in fact made of love love runs through each of our cells and as we become more aware of its presence within us we are able to attract more of it from the outer world so take a few more moments to allow these words to permeate your being I am made of love I am made of love I am made of love [Music] if any emotions arise know that this is entirely okay allow these emotions to free you allow them to melt away taking limiting notions along with them as they disobeyed emotions are often tired with words and stories if stories emerge in the mind simply acknowledge them without allowing them to attach themselves to you you are made of love any wording or stories that contradict this truth is not born of your truest nature so take three more deep breaths with these words held in mind and heart I am made of love I am made of love I am made of love [Music] [Music] [Music] bring your awareness back to the heart space now continually allowing this space within you to expand and soften with each full breath each breath through the heart cleanses and nourishes your being freeing up constricted energy that no longer serves your highest purpose and your dreams as you breathe releasing unloving notions and embracing the truth of who you are begin to feel the heart expanding beyond the chest as its walls soften you find that the heart begins to touch the outside world with a deep awareness for the unlimited and unbounded nature of love you might like to envision a white light expanding from the heart reaching to touch each area of the body and beyond [Music] your entire being is bathed in this white loving light as all motions in contradiction to love melt away you are whole and complete here love radiates from your being [Music] [Music] [Music] as you sink further into this state of relaxation allow your highest mind to conjure up visions of qualities you were deeply attracted to in a person [Music] as you rest in the awareness that you are currently complete and whole as you are you begin to consider what type of person you wish to share your life with with that person be a romantic partner friend or soul made of some other form allow your fullest heart to direct you through this inner exploration continue to explore what qualities am i deeply attracted to in a person [Music] [Music] you take your time here becoming aware of how the past may attempt to interfere with what type of qualities and type of person you envision allow any beliefs not rooted in love to melt away allow the heart to guide your highest mind to create a feeling of what this manifested soulmate ignites within you what feelings does your sole lover or friend bring to you what qualities invite a further expansion of the heart [Music] what type of person do you wish to share the fullness of your being with just take a few moments to rest here as you continue to breathe through the hard space allowing the feeling of this person to come to you you may construct and deconstruct as much as necessary moving closer and closer to your most authentic self allow your most heart centered feelings to create an image in your mind of what this person is like [Music] whatever your soul calls for is a reflection of your highest self and fullest heart allow the soul to guide your loving imagination as you manifest this beautiful and loving relationship [Music] trust that the universe is supporting your journey with each breath you take with each expansion and softening of the heart the universe moves through you you are coming closer and closer to manifesting in the physical reality the love that is desired by your highest self [Music] come back to the breath now for a few moments of silence as you melt into this present moment with complete trust and faith that your soul is manifesting a love of your truest dreams there is nothing you need to chase and nothing you need to do simply allow your highest mind and heart to conspire in creating the love of your dreams what you seek is seeking you allow it to come naturally into both the mental emotional and physical realms there is no need to control or to chase simply allow your highest self to guide you [Music] [Music] love is not limited to romance love is irrelevant to physical intimacy wherever you are right now you are manifesting a love that is in accordance with your deepest needs at present love may show up as a true friend a family member a new connection or an old one a human or a pet there is no limit to love there is no limit to the type of love we are capable of manifesting whatever your sole cause for is your truest desire simply take a moment here to rest in whatever form of love your heart and soul are calling for [Music] take a few deep breaths here in tin ually coming back to the innate beauty and support of the heart as you rest in stillness and deep relaxation gently introduce the affirmation I am attracting a loving relationship I am attracting a loving relationship I am attracting a loving relationship as you repeat this affirmation scan your body to become aware of any parts of you that may be holding on to tension or resistance just continue repeating the affirmation as you relax any constriction within the forit the belly the chest your jaw allow any resistance to drop away as you come to a deeper knowing that you are in fact attracting a loving relationship in this very moment continue to repeat these words for a few more complete breath cycles expanding into abundance on each inhalation and softening any residing resistance on each exhalation know that in this very moment you are attracting a beautiful and loving relationship [Music] before moving into a deep and restful sleep allow your mind to really hold the image of love that you have created take a few breaths to relish in this deep and beautiful love that you are envisioning that you are currently manifesting born from a place of inner completeness you are attracting a beautiful deep and loving relationship whatever type of soulmate is destiny to enter your life at this point in time is being wholeheartedly invited into your realm of being there is nothing you need to actively do now you are free to rest into a deep trust and knowing that love is abundant within you it is also ever-present around you [Music] come now back to the heart space and begin to witness the white glows presents once again as you become aware of it once more allow it to expand into the mind's eye bathing both you and your soulmate with unconditional love and light allow the mind to soften as you calm into a deep stillness found it on a deep trust in this unfolding that is occurring [Music] you are invited now to retreat back to the heart as you prepare for a deep and beautiful sleep know that this process of manifestation will continue as you rest even as you sleep your energy continues to attract the people and experiences that are in line with your highest dreams allow yourself to sink further into this knowing the love that your highest self yearns for is on its way to you [Music] as you rest here allow yourself to melt completely into this present moment once again there is nothing that needs to be done here as the day fades into night all that is asked off is that you surrender in this moment can you release yourself into this safety comfort and loving support of a deep and nourishing sleep allow the heart space to be your anchor as you slowly make your way towards a restful slumber notice how it rises and falls with each breath taken this breath supports you through waking life and through sleep continually bringing nourishment to the body mind and soul [Music] continue to breathe deeply gently rocking yourself to sleep resting in the true knowledge that love is abundant love is ever-present and that the love you yearn for is making its way towards you what you seek is

are safe and that you can feel comfortable drifting to sleep for the night when you are ready close your eyes and settle as you connect with your own inner wisdom and true self the day is complete and you can now give yourself permission to let go and relax into comfort let your body sink into the surface below you make any adjustments you need in your body to let yourself settle deeper into the support and recognize that you are supported so you can let go as you gradually settle connect with your inner companion your breath it is always there for you ready to connect you to a calm and peaceful state at any moment it's a reminder as you settle in that you have given yourself this gift of meditation bring your awareness to the natural rhythm of your breath at first simply notice the sensations that accompany your breath maybe you feel a slightly cool sensation as the air passes through your nostrils perhaps you feel a floating sensation as your abdomen and chest rise and fill with breath or a heaviness as the air moves out of your body taking with it any tension or tightness whatever you are feeling is just right simply observe the experience as you inhale sense an opening or a creation of spaciousness at the area of your heart and when you exhale feel a gentle compression in this area as your lungs are giving your heart a hug this internal support from your inner companion is available to you with each and every breath you take so knowing this you can be comforted that you are always supported from within allow this support welcome the breath invite the inner hug shortly i will guide you to take several deep breaths sensing first your inhale and then inviting your exhale to be slightly longer than your inhale you can always welcome a short pause after you exhale trusting that your body will know when to breathe in again begin to intentionally inhale deeply and extend your exhale slightly longer than your inhale after you exhale welcome a brief pause for the length of time that feels comfortable for you today and breathe in again trusting you know the timing that is right for you continue this way and trust the wisdom of your body in connection with your inner companion allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical or emotional stress and tension [Music] by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow [Music] your body and mind will calm down in response trust and allow i'll remain quiet as you enjoy this practice for the next few moments when your mind wanders simply begin again and guide your focus back to your breath [Music] so release this breath pattern now [Music] and as your breath returns to its natural rhythm notice the change in how you feel let gravity settle over you there is no need to hold against it anymore there is no need to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders any longer notice any areas in your body where you may be holding on to tension or tightness and invite a sense of ease to wash over you give yourself permission to enjoy letting go into relaxation now is your time to be fully supported to let go and relax anywhere you can as you observe your body soften and release any areas you are able invite the feeling of peace as you begin to tune out the whole world around you [Music] and go within with my voice as a soothing guide to help you sleep now follow the sound of my voice as i guide your attention on a relaxed journey moving your attention through various parts of your body without effort let go of stories or expectations of these parts of your body and notice them as if meeting them for the first time [Music] as your focus flows your energy will follow and this will invite ease into your body [Music] as your physical body continues to relax become aware of the sensations at your forehead notice your right eye and your left eye relax the tiny muscles and nerves in and around both of your eyes and feel as your eyelids become heavy [Music] sense your right cheek from the outside as well as from inside your mouth [Music] now your left cheek outside and inside your mouth allow both of your cheeks to soften inside and out become aware of the right side of your jaw and the left side of your jaw unclench both sides of your jaw and allow your teeth to part gently move your attention to the inside of your mouth now notice your gums and your tongue soften now that your face eyes and mouth are completely relaxed consider the idea of a smile the part of a smile we can see and that we associate with the word smile is on the face we recognize a smile in the eyes the turning up of the corners of the mouth a glow over the entire face there is so much this simple gesture can convey to another person as well as make us feel from within this is only part of how a smile can be experienced throughout the entire body [Music] this is only a fraction of how a smile can be expressed sense a relaxed smile on your face now [Music] perhaps it feels artificial at first allow the smile to move over your entire face [Music] a smile can change your mood change how you feel about yourself and others it can alter your perspective and bring joy to your state of being as you explore and connect with your physical experience look inward and consider what it would feel like to draw a connection between a smile on your face with a smiling at your heart how would it feel to be smiling from your heart perhaps you might experience a smile of the heart with each inhale as your chest rises [Music] and your collarbones widen then each exhale your lungs continue to give your heart another hug as you inhale in your mind think i am smiling as you exhale in your mind think i am supporting myself with a hug invite the sensations of the smile from your face to move down to the space around your heart allow these smiling qualities to surround you like a warm embrace of a loved one connect with your smile with every breath you take as a reminder to come back to yourself if you find your mind wandering lovingly bring your attention back to your smile and to each breath inhale i am smiling exhale i am supporting myself with a hug [Music] a smile tells your body that you are okay a smile tells you that you can accept joy and happiness keep your attention on your smile on the sensations of your smile on your face and on your heart and on the joyful emotions your smile can evoke a smile can unravel the tension and help you let go of negativity continue to stay with the sensations of your smile allow it to relax you even more deeply allow your smile to bring joy contentment and peace a smile is the language of the soul the language of the body let your smile be an expression of your inner companion that you are your

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided bedtime meditation that will help you to fall asleep quickly and soundly over the course of this meditation you will move deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation releasing all physical tension before being guided into a beautiful visualization that will enhance your inner sense of peace and tranquility there is nothing required for you to actively do here you are simply invited to open your mind as you are guided naturally towards a peaceful slumber before you settle into the space you're in take a moment to ensure that your blinds are drawn and your morning alarm is set when you're ready to put the day behind you and sure you're in a comfortable lying down position as you prepare for complete release and relaxation use any blankets and cushions to support yourself as necessary and when you are in utmost comfort take a few slow and grounding breaths to connect with this moment in space and time [Music] the breath is a gateway into the present moment and into deep release and greater alignment though this invisible life forced often goes overlooked it is one of the most powerful tools of relaxation available to us in any given moment so take this opportunity now to witness the breath to simply observe its depth and rhythm allowing it to deepen as you naturally ease your way into this period of darkness draw your attention to the stomach noticing the way the breath follows suit as we consciously welcome our breath into the belly we initiate the body's relaxation response lowering stress hormones blood pressure muscle tension and our breathing rate inhale all the way into the base of the spine and then exhale completely softening all muscles as you surrender a little bit further now I invite you to introduce small pauses between inhalation and exhalation resting in complete stillness for just a moment after each in-breath and each out breath so it's going to be inhale to a count of four pause for a brief moment and then exhale completely for a count of four pausing for just a moment of complete stillness once again witness the body relaxing more fully as you breathe in the slow and steady way for three more rounds on your own now [Music] gently release your attention from the breath now tuning into the visceral sensations of the body hold the entire body in your awareness for a few moments noticing if there's any physical tension or contraction present if you come across any area in need of love and release just gently draw your breath towards this region on your next inhalation inviting nourishing light to support your full release and as you exhale allow all tightness and all tension to dissipate feeling yourself sink more completely into the surface beneath you as you welcome release into the physical body through your breath the mind naturally follows suit moving into greater peace and harmony so follow my voice as you are guided through the body using the power of your attention to grant full release begin by a breathing loving-kindness into the feet area releasing any heaviness that may be stored here breathe into the legs now thanking these limbs for carrying you throughout your day and then allowing them to relax completely into this moment [Music] inhale deeply now into the hips and pelvis softening and releasing on the exhalation and then move to the belly allowing your core muscles to relax and the breath to flow effortlessly into this area of the body [Music] hope in your heart and chest now as you breathe nourishing lifeforce into this center of your pain softening on the exhale [Music] soften your hands allowing them to sink into the surface beneath you and then grant the same release to your arms just letting them melt away for the night soften your shoulders your neck region your jaw your cheeks and nose and your eyes take a moment to soften the eyebrows in the forward just allowing all mental tension to dissipate as you release all muscles surrounding your thinking mind hold your entire body in your awareness now allowing it to be completely at peace in this present moment return to your breath for a couple more cycles noticing once again the short pauses in between each in-breath and each out breath now feeling physically relaxed and in alignment with this present moment I invite you to tune in to the mind's eye without force or strain allow the following visualization to conjure images of deep peace and tranquility as you move gracefully into a deep slumber for the night in your open field of vision now begin to visualize you're on a tropical island feet firmly grounded into the warm crystals of sand that stretch out to either side of you where you rest the waters are shallow off the coast lending themselves to crystal clear turquoise hues and the most beautiful waters you have ever laid eyes on the salty breeze infiltrates your nostrils and you exhale deeply feeling yourself sink further into this paradise island that warms both body and soul you take a few steps forward slowly eventually coming to dip your toes in the warm yet refreshing waters that surround this small Paradise Island standing at a balance point between ocean and earth ankle deep in those turquoise waters inner peace flows through you as you come to realize you are whole and complete just as you are you yearn to dive into the healing salty waters before you and so prepare yourself for this descent when you are ready you begin to walk slowly and mindfully away from the steady Shore step by step until soon your lower legs are submerged you continue walking slowly and with grace until soon you are waist-deep in these cleansing waters you pause here tracing the surface of the ocean with your fingertips and when you are ready you reach your arms ahead of you as you shallow dive into the crystal clarity that now bathes your entire body as each crystal bead of ocean rushes along your skin you feel restored and renewed turning onto your back you allow your body to float on the still surface the ocean is calm and quiet nestling you continually into a peaceful state that lives both within and around you the salt water cleanses your skin rejuvenating your physical body energetically it penetrates deeper healing and nourishing your spiritual and emotional bodies all trapped emotions and all old energy systems are absorbed by the healing potential of these waters this process of renewal leaves you free to relax completely floating here on the surface of the water you are in a state of complete bliss [Music] the mind softens entirely nothing tethered to it any longer any thoughts that do rise in your consciousness are released to the ocean as swiftly as they came you know that any thoughts or emotions that arise do not belong to you there are simply bodies of energy coming like waves before dissolving back into the wholeness of the ocean [Music] Aya's transfixed with the sky you notice the lighting and shade overhead is shifting blue hues now blend into a subtle orange signifying that the Sun is now setting behind the horizon you take this as a cue to return to land turning back towards the beach and the canopy of palm trees that overhang it you return to your feet gliding out of the water slowly step by step you finally come to reach land and find that a plush towel neatly folded on the warm sand has been sent for you by the universe you wrap yourself in this warm soothing towel and begin to walk slowly down the beach into the sunset as you walk you open your senses to this environment you notice the aroma of the salty air continually cleansing you with each breath you taste the salt on the outer edges of your lips left behind from your healing dip in the ocean you hear the gentle rustling of palm trees a subtle lapping of water against the shore and the sound of release that comes with each deep exhale you make tuning into your sense of touch you feel the warmth and comfort of the towel against your skin as well as the sweetness of sand beneath your feet staring ahead you see the crest of beautiful palm trees the white sand slowly becoming darker as night approaches and the vibrant sky now orange and magenta as the Sun has disappeared behind the horizon just a dozen yards ahead of you firmly grounded in the shallow waters by sturdy stilts you see an overwater bungalow connected to the shore by a long wooden dock this is your own private Cabana where you will sleep the night away in tranquillity step-by-step continuing to move slowly and mindfully

1 [Music] [Laughter] [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided visualization it's designed to promote peace of mind for returned soldiers experiencing post-traumatic stress upon returning home before we move into this visual journey I would like to acknowledge that this recording is not a replacement for professional support but rather it is a tool that can help you to explore the possibility of finding a safe and comfortable place within yourself it is an anchor into the present moment of course I encourage anyone listening to this to seek the support that they need from professionals and use this meditation solely as a peaceful way to help you find peace and release during those quiet moments before falling asleep so before we begin I invite you to make sure that you are entirely comfortable in the place that you are now in if there's anything that brings you extra peace and comfort reach out for these now and this could be as simple as your pillow a sacred object on your bedside table or anything at all that brings you more comfort so making sure that you're in a comfortable lying down position and take a few full settling breaths here as you ground yourself into this space at any point during this meditation or at any point throughout the days and nights to come I invite you to remember that your breath is always available as an anchor into the present moment each time we draw our awareness to the breath the past disappears the future disappears and we are reminded of the stillness that lives in this very moment breath awareness requires nothing but your attention and can be practiced at any time for just a few seconds or for many so right now follow my voice for the next short while as you deepen your awareness of this life force that flows in and out of your body constantly as you inhale become more observant of your sensory experience as the air flows into your nostrils through your windpipe and deep into your lungs [Music] and as you exhale witness the release that occurs as the belly softens the chest falls and your mind just drops away continue to breathe with this heightened awareness paying close attention to the pauses in between each breath cycle so after each inhalation see if you can notice the complete stillness where the breath is held for just a brief second and after each exhalation observe that momentary stillness after all the air has been released and just in your own time repeating this observation on your own for a few more breaths cycles [Music] [Music] know that wherever you have been whatever lingers from days now behind you you exist nowhere but in this present moment reality allow the breath and your physical body to remind you of this moving deeply into your physical presence anytime the mind wanders into stories or images of the past you are here you are held by your breath your body and spirit right here [Music] while we cannot change what has happened in the past we can continually draw ourselves more affirmative ly into today by welcoming ourselves exactly as we are into the reality of this present moment we find space to honor where we've been while also knowing that we are only ever right here right now this is the only time we truly have so in just a moment you will be guided through a safe and soothing visualization to help you tune into more completely to the present moment take a few more slow and steady breaths and just after a few cycles let's begin [Music] you [Music] shifting your attention now away from your breath and into the empty space behind your closed eyes and this space holds infinite potential for freedom and release when we adorn it with images of peace and light and love so upon this blank canvas I invite you to witness yourself appearing in a place that provides you with a sense of safety and love for you this might be a particular outdoor landscape or it might be an indoor space it might be a setting from your childhood or a place that exists today or it could even be from your imagination [Music] there are no rules as to what this space looks like so long as it provides you with the sense that you are safe supported and held exactly as you are [Music] explore this space as you please tuning into any and all of your senses that are appropriate here what does the imagery evoke within you are there any aromas textures or tastes that bring about a sense of peace and security [Music] what sounds are present in the space that surround you if there are no sounds can the silence carry you deeper into stillness and contentment [Music] take a full nourishing inhale and as you exhale just gently release any tension fear or worry letting it go [Music] now I invite you to welcome other beings into this space if it feels comfortable for you whoever brings you a sense of peace and love is welcome here perhaps you invite friends to join you family members [Music] professionals you've worked with or pets while these beings cannot free you of your past they can support you in your journey as you move forward if you feel more at peace in this space alone know that this is entirely okay as well from moment to moment we require different things sometimes it is the support of those who love us sometimes it is our personal connection to our highest self to nature to universe if the latter is true for you in this moment invite your higher self the natural world or your understanding of God or the universe into the space within you even if you have welcomed humans or pets into the visualization already you too may also invite these deeper connections to support you right now if emotions arise simply acknowledge them and witness them as passing clouds tuning in to how they feel within the body rather than the story that they weave in the mind just trust that this beautiful safe space you have created as the capacity to hold you exactly as you are and know that there is no weakness in feeling emotion our emotions are a part of what makes us human and they are entirely welcome here [Music] continually returned to the peaceful imagery around you and to whatever you have conjured here that brings you peace [Music] now wherever you have found yourself in this visualization I invite you to take a seat on the earth or on a couch or any other surface that fits your environment just getting comfortable you might conjure up any supportive elements that make you feel at home you might light a few candles in your mind's eye or surround yourself with any other sacred objects that settle you I invite you to visualize a photo album presenting itself on the floor or a small table before you inscribed in golden cursive print on the cover the album reads for safe keeping in the soul this album has presented itself for you so that you may have a safe space to place any recurring images or dreams about the past whatever you have witnessed and experienced cannot be taken away from you however the past can be laid gently to rest tucked away in a safe corner of the soul to inspire the next stage of your life's purpose take the album in your hands breathing deeply as you hold it in quiet reverence [Music] if any challenging thoughts or images arise in your consciousness turn these into photographs and tuck them gently into your album laying the past down this way in help to honor where you've been while creating space for lighter imagery and experiences to take root this is not a denial of where you have been but it may serve as a reminder that these images are snapshots of the past and now you have a brighter lighter future to look forward to [Music] [Music] [Music] take a few more silent moments to respectfully tuck away any old photographs that no longer need to take up space in the forefront of your mind if the imagery does not arise naturally or if it is too painful for you to process in this way at this time tune into the natural rhythm of your breath as you quietly repeat the words right here right now I am safe right here right now I am safe you I invite you to close the photo album now knowing that you can come back to it at any time you need to store the passed away for safekeeping and remember that none of this is a denial of the life you have lived it is simply a way of clearing space for new life to emerge take a few final moments now to tune back into the beautiful room or landscape you have visualized using your breath to ground you here for just a few more moments look around at the support systems that are available to you friends family members plants and animals support professionals your highest self the universe anything else in which you find peace meaning and contentment come back to your breath remembering that this very simple life force that we so often take for granted is a pathway back to the present moment back into peace gently now allow the scene you have created to begin dissolving as you reconnect with your awareness of your body in the room and physically support you allow each muscle to soften melting further into the surface beneath you draw the mind down into the heart space thanking yourself for harnessing the courage and Trust required to move through this journey now as you gently surrender into sleep allow the following affirmations to fuel your continued evolution bringing you deeper into peace contentment and release you may like to mentally repeat these affirmations as you drift off into sleep I love and honor myself I love and honor myself [Music] I am supported by the world around me I am supported by the world around me [Music] I see myself in a lighter future I see myself in a lighter future [Music] I forgive myself as I forgive others I forgive myself as I forgive others

1 you [Music] hello I'm Jason Stephenson and welcome to this healing meditation designed to enhance your experience of physical and emotional well-being as you prepare for a deeply restorative sleep during this guided meditation you will bring compassion and healing attention to different parts of the body and mind before finding your way into a deep slumber I invite you now to open your heart to the transformative capacity of this meditation and to that of your own inner being [Music] before we begin take a moment to ensure that everything in the outside world is turned off or put away for the day the lights and any alerts on your phone or other devices are turned off and preferably the blinds are drawn ensuring that all end of day tasks are taken care of will help you to immerse yourself in this meditation and into deeply healing sleep once all of the outside requirements are taken care of take some time to ensure that you're in a comfortable lying down position ensure that the body is relaxed and well supported as you come to find stillness wherever you are [Music] gently closing your eyes and take a moment now to see if you can feel into the physical space that supports you notice the way your body is held in the safety and solidity of the physical world know that it is safe for you to let go to allow any held tension to melt away in this very moment [Music] [Music] whatever presents itself during this or during any meditation is entirely welcomed it is safe for you to be fully present within your experience allow your own inner strength my voice and the deep silence to guide you through this meditation you are well taken care of within your own presence begin to witness the way that breath flows through you come to see how effortlessly it fills your physical body and then how naturally it glides back into the outer environment for a few moments now draw your attention to your breath allowing it to ground you in this present moment [Music] [Music] the outside world gently falls away as you are guided continuously via the breath back into this very moment in time now without attempting to change your breath in any way I invite you to draw your attention to the belly simply observe the way it rises and the way it falls and notice what happens to the breath as you draw your attention to the stomach what happens to the body is there a softening or possibly a sense of release is the ease or unease whatever may be the case for you simply acknowledge what is present within the body as you shift your attention from breath to belly [Music] [Music] [Music] getting to know the body in this way facilitates your ability to heal itself this type of getting to know the body is not intellectual in any way it's experiential through this meditation you're invited to become more intimate with the physical body witnessing it exactly as it rests here right in this very moment by practicing this deep presence we shift from thinking into feeling and into being by allowing the body to be exactly as it is and by bringing our awareness to it we begin to soften the mental preconceptions maintaining their firm grip on our beliefs about the body gently allow any firmly held concepts to melt away allowing a deeper experience of full openness and presence to take its place [Music] come back to the breath for a few moments allowing it to continually carry you into each unfolding moment breath by breath moment by moment [Music] I invite you now to expand the scope of your breath on your next inhalation gently guide or envision the breath spanning all the way down to your toes and on the next exhalation guide the breath to the top of your head nourishing each part as it passes continue to envision the breath looping gently through your body this way softening every area of stress or tension that it touches take a few moments of silence here allowing the breath to soothe every cell of your body [Music] as you come to be more in touch with the body on a deeper level take a moment to consider that you are made up of trillions of cells each of these cells intermingles with the others in order to keep you alive and well as you rest in meditation the body welcomes this space and time provided to heal itself on a deep level sale a level know that right now the body is taking care of itself to bring you into a greater sense of vitality and wellness so take a moment now to gently scan the body noticing any spiraling sensations of energy moving through you as you come to feel the body on an energetic level see if you begin to consciously touch the cellular level of the body take a few moments of silence here to dive into the subtle realms of the body to those parts that go invisible to the eye [Music] draw your awareness naturally to various areas of the body allowing yourself to be guided by your inner compass simply notice what you notice simply allow yourself to feel what you feel your own inner wisdom will guide you let any notions about what this experience should be like just to fall away and as you move deeply into yourself take time to notice any areas of tension pain or discomfort [Music] now this pain or discomfort may be primarily physical it may be emotional or energetic simply notice what areas of your being are calling to you for healing take a moment to focus on one area of the body or mind that is speaking to you through discomfort or tension as you bring your attention to this area allow your breath to follow this awareness just gently and naturally allow your breath and your inner capacity for compassion to touch this place [Music] without trying to change anything about this experience allow the discomfort to be bathed by the warmth of your breath and by your loving presence so take a few moments of silence here as you allow your body to heal on a cellular level [Music] you [Music] now gently loosen your attention coming back to the rhythm of your natural breath remember that your breath is your anchor and if at any point your mind wanders your breath is always available to redirect you to your present experience so come now to a different area of the body or mind to a second aspect of you in need of a little extra support care or tenderness invite this place into your awareness as you cleanse it with your inner infinite well of love and kindness hold it compassionately in your field of awareness allowing the breath to soothe it and as you breathe let any tension or pain that is held there to slowly soften [Music] continue to breathe consciously as we enter a few moments of silence during which you may dedicate your love and attention to this second area of your being [Music] [Music] gently softening your inner gaze come back to the steady flow of your breath allow yourself to feel into a deeper stillness and sense of relaxation that is present to you right now know that your body is being healed energetically physically and emotionally as you rest here in stillness so come now to one more area of the body physical emotional or otherwise energetic that is calling for your attention do not seek for anything to come to you simply allow it to enter into your awareness if you are now feeling deeply healed and relaxed and no specific aspect of your being is appearing hold your entire body in the field of your awareness now breathe into the area that has come to you or into your entire body with a warm and loving presence allow yourselves to transform as we speak perhaps feeling their energetic presence within the body and mind bathe in this loving attention allowing the breath to nourish and to heal [Music] [Music] I invite you now to soften your attention once more gently releasing whatever it is holding as you return to your

sink deeper and deeper into your innate wholeness [Music] as we prepare for sleep who will come to release all areas of the body gently and naturally allow my voice to guide you towards each body part and as I name each part simply hold this piece of you in your awareness and then allow it to let go of any remaining tension stress or other sensation allow each part of you to sink into a deeper

tightness let go of your jaw [Music] and becoming aware of your mouth just allow it to be there loose and soft maybe slightly opened [Music] the nose and cheeks and relax your closed eyes and your eyebrows soften the furrowed allowing any tension held here just to melt away and hold the top of your head in your awareness the back of your head [Music] and now your entire head allowing it to release any unease that may be present [Music] envision your whole body now entirely relaxed and healed emotionally physically and energetically sensor lightness to your being radiating out from each cell of your body in this moment you are free relaxed and full of health and vitality so coming back now to your breath allowing each inhalation and each exhalation to continually nourish and support you [Music] as you rest in this space you begin to sense the lightness of your body and mind moving closer towards sleep allow yourself now to drift into the dream world and naturally know that the cellular healing will continue while you sleep your body's wisdom will continue to restore your being with each breath [Music] as you rest here peacefully come to notice a wider light pulsating from the heart space within its glow it carries love lightness and the capacity for deep healing become aware of it expanding slowly nurturing each part of the body that it touches this white light consumes everything in its way leaving no part of the body or mind untouched it holds the capacity to transform your being and to bring you health vitality and radiance over time this white light comes to touch every part of the body from the edge of your toes to the top of your head it goes so far as to expand to fill the room outside the perceived boundaries of your being everything in your mind's eye now rests in this healing white light nothing is too dark or too heavy to be illuminated the white glow softens your body and mind carrying you naturally into a deeply restorative slumber

1 hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this soothing nighttime meditation designed to help you to fully relax and to let go this will include a body scan meditation as we move through this meditation allow my voice and the sound of rainfall to guide you through this process of deep release and restoration know that you are safe and supported throughout this meditation in each and every moment that unfolds you to come into a comfortable lying down position any resting position will do but try to ensure that your chest is open and your neck is in line with your spine just sink a little bit further into the surface that supports you the physical world will nurture you throughout the journey so feel free to invite the intention to surrender to your body and mind at this present moment letting yourself sink deeply into the physical space beneath you to help affirm moment to repeat the following words after me I am free to let go I am free to let go I am free to let go now gently release any and all words that are circulating within the mind as you open your heart and body allowing them to guide the way this meditation is aimed to help you release tension in the body and to let go of all stress and unease that is present in the mind as we move through life it is not uncommon to become weighed down by things that have happened in the past by things we think we are by things we think that other people are by fears about the future and while there are doubtedly many challenges that exist in this human experience we can help to reset both body and mind by consciously inviting ourselves to surrender or resistance to this present moment because the truth is that cannot harm you cannot harm you is here to nourish and support you so take a few deep breaths now as you remind yourself that you are entirely safe right here right now you now draw your awareness to the natural rhythm of your breath without trying to change it in any way simply observe its flow and depth in this moment you notice any sensations that are present as you inhale deeply through the nose and as you exhale completely allowing your lungs and belly to soften entirely you notice the sound of the breath makes notice the way the breath interacts with the physical body putting any visceral sensations as it moves through you a few moments of silence he simply observing your direct experience of the breath right at this moment you draw your attention now to the belly and observe the way the breath follows you there allow each inhalation to expand the stomach completely exhalation to soften the belly letting all tension and contraction of muscles melt away the depths of the belly as you breathe allowing your breath to move freely to the furthest corners of the body you as we mindfully allow the breath to touch deeper reaches of the respiratory system we unconsciously activate the body's relaxation response this response helps to slow a racing heart sue the worried mind and release tense muscles take a few moments of silence now to consciously observe the belly and the breath flowing in harmony you I invite you now to tune into your sense of sound labeling or judging anything that filters through your ears simply become aware of the vibrations that enter your awareness sounds maybe near subtle hole loud just note them without hanging on to them allowing them to come and go the way waves and flow you now as you tune into the sound of the rain beginning to fill your eardrums begin to observe the way it cleanses your body of everything it has been holding on to for some time rain is a beautiful and powerful tool of transformation that will help to nourish and cleanse your entire being through your journey so surrender gently now to the healing rain that falls through your awareness carry your attention away from your sense of sound now as you move more deeply into your sense of touch take a moment to observe each area of your physical body that is in contact with the surface beneath you see if you can notice the temperature and texture of each surface that is nestled against your skin see if you can release a little bit further still into the bed or any other surface that support you now to prepare the soil for the mind to feel free and safe to let go of all worried and repetitive thoughts let us move more deeply into the body I invite you now to follow my voice as I guide you through a complete body scan to help you release all tight muscles both conscious and unconscious as you listen simply allow your attention to move to the area's you hear mentioned consciously inviting release and relaxation to each of these parts so let's begin by taking three full breaths while holding awareness of your body as a whole there is no need to actively change anything right now just simply observe now draw your attention to your left toes feeling into them with just your awareness as we move through this exercise try to refrain from moving sing if you can witness each area while maintaining complete stillness so breathing into your left toes noticing their presence and then on your next exhalation release any and all tension that resides there completely allowing them to be entirely free within this moment of stillness witness and release all tension in your left foot now inhaling and exhaling as you observe this area of the body move up to the ankle breathing into this space and then exhaling softening completely witness and release the lower left leg breathing in and out of the left knee area and the upper left leg so hold the entire left leg in your awareness now inhaling nourishment into this area of the body and exhaling or stress tension and unease now draw your awareness to the right toes inhaling deeply and then releasing them on the next exhale and continue in the same way as you observe the right foot the right ankle the lower right leg the knee and the upper right leg and take a moment now to hold your entire right leg in your awareness welcoming deep release on the inhalation and inviting it to let go completely on your next exhalation bring your awareness now to your pelvis breathing down to your pelvis and release and your hips and to the buttocks allowing each of these areas to sink deeply into the surface beneath you as you come to fully relax each part witness and release your belly the lower back and then gently draw your awareness up to the spine consciously relaxing the muscles all around your vertebrae as you draw your awareness upwards inhale deeply into the full capacity of the lungs and then exhale slowly allowing your chest to completely relax continue to observe the sounds around you allowing the distant rain to wash your physical body clean of all stressors and thoughts that may have been unconsciously lodged away witness and relax your left fingers now into your left hand your left wrist and lower left arm observe and then release a tightness or contraction in the elbow and the upper left arm and moving slowly until finally reaching the left shoulder just hold your entire left arm in your awareness as you let go of all discomfort and tension stored in this area of the body draw your awareness now to the right fingertips and to the right hand release or discomfort in the right wrist and breathing into the lower right arm the elbow and the upper right arm breathing deeply and then exhale allowing the shoulders to soften as well just witness and release the entire right arm now now observe the neck area letting go of anything stored in the throat region so to fully relax this area take a deep inhalation and as you exhale release a deep sigh through your escaping breath and notice the way the rest of the body is reminded to soften as you do this relax your jaw the cheeks and the nose draw your attention now to all the small muscles around your eyes and forward consciously inviting them to let go of all stress they may be carrying observe and relax the top of your head inviting all thoughts to dissolve as you become more and more tuned into the simplicity of the present moment and finally hold your entire body in your awareness catch the mind when it attempts to search for something prove something or chase something just accept this present moment experience - the way it is reminding yourself that there is nothing to do nothing to prove and nothing you need to be you are already enough right here right now take a few more minutes to breathe into the fullness of your body imagine your breath reaching all the way down to the tips of each limb follow your breath all the way there watching and nourishing the entire body as it moves through every inch of your being so take a moment now to let everything melt away as you tune into the sound of the rain falling all around you open your ears fully as the rain cleanses your body mind and heart if you notice your thoughts wandering at any point simply observe this wandering as a tendency of the mind without attaching yourself to the ideas or stories it is drifting too it is easy to become swept away by the current of the mind but as we practice gently releasing these thoughts streams we find that we become more like the rock bed beneath the stream still solid and deeply rooted to the present moment now open your awareness more intently to the sounds around you once again rain continues to fall washing away or thoughts and stories that no longer serve you take a moment now to imagine yourself lying in a safe space that is open to the elements witness yourself resting peacefully here perhaps directly on the earth or perhaps supported by blankets or cushions observe the area around you someplace with lush greenery bright blossoms that have been nourished by the falling rains witness the way the rain falls upon your body nurturing you much the same way that it supports and nourishes the plant life around you as the rain falls down you begin to grow out of an older version of you out of older stories out of old attachments and out of any confinements imposed on you by the mind you begin to blossom the rain is warm against your skin comforting you as it gently Falls take a moment to simply observe yourself here in this moment witnessing your entire being resting completely at peace beneath the softness of rain that trickles down as thoughts arise within the mind observe them as the energy bodies that do not belong to you and then practice raising them ever so slightly so that they come to rest on the surface of your skin somewhere along your forehead and as the rain trickles down what should carry these thoughts away with it gliding effortlessly away from your body and down down down into the earth the earth and rain paired together are a powerful tool of transformation the earth helps to ground to hold energies freeing up space for new life to be born while the rain helps to improve flow in the physical world water continues to trickle down from the expansive sky taking in and releasing all old thoughts stories and beliefs that might continue to arise breathe through an open heart as you allow whatever arises to be cleansed if fearful worried or judgmental thoughts arise about this process of release or about your intent to let go simply observe these thoughts as their own life forms too and remind yourself that they are separate from who you really are they do not belong to you and they no longer serve you just open your heart to freedom to release and personal growth compassionately inviting the old to be returned to the earth for processing and renewal if physical tension or discomfort arises within the body observe that too and then gently guide the tense energy towards the surface of the body as the rain trickles down witness it carrying away any and/or discomfort that may have been lodged away in the muscles and cells there is no need to carry this tension any longer continue to ground yourself through the sound of the falling rain allowing it to be your anchor into the present moment while keeping the breath deep draw your awareness to the heart space filling it with love and ease on each inhalation and freeing it of all tension stress and concern on each exhalation through your exhalations offer up all remaining tension to be cleansed by the rain perhaps sighing deeply as you feel into this process of letting go your entire being may now be much lighter and at once was your heart rate has slowed and your breathing has taken on a deep and steady rhythm just allow the breath to rock you gently as the rain continues to trickle down though the rain continues it finds less and less stress and discomfort needing to be cleansed away you are now moving towards a state of deep peace and relaxation completely free of everything that once weighed you down now gently let go of any remaining visuals in your mind's eye allowing the image of you being bathed by the rain to slowly melt away in its place with eyes remaining closed tuned into the space around you once again observe the feel of the surfaces beneath you and around you and then connect to the air as it brushes against your skin and as it fills your lungs continue to breathe slowly and deeply as you continue to hold your awareness on this state of complete ease and relaxation there is nothing left for you to do to open your heart and surrender your mind to a deep and restorative sleep very soon your mindful awareness will melt away into a deep and peaceful slumber till then continue to witness the breath coming and going like waves ABing and flowing Oh being and flowing you
1 [Music] Allu my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation designed to help you ease into a peaceful night's sleep in this meditation you will be guided to gently release any held stress and anxiety allowing the body and mind to rest with ease throughout the night this visualization will take you on a magical inner forest journey where you will encounter various creatures along the way that will guide you further along the path towards release peace and tranquillity all that is required of you is your innate capacity for openness so gently allow the body and mind to soften as we begin this journey before you release yourself from what's being carried on throughout today just take a moment now to get comfortable adjust yourself as necessary you might want to use further cushions or blankets or get your pillow exactly as you would like [Music] and just allow the body to softly relax taking a moment to feel into the physical environment you find yourself in keeping your eyes closed allow your body to revel in the physical world around you taking pause here to give gratitude to this very moment where you find yourself currently in so I invite you now to bring your awareness to your breath simply by observing it the breath draws our attention to the present moment and is within this present moment that everything else naturally falls away allow your breath to be your anchor guiding you through the silent gaps between the visualizations of this meditation [Music] follow your breath sound natural rhythm watching it naturally deepen as you draw your attention to it there is no breathing technique required here only an honest and open witnessing as you watch the breath allow any thoughts or judgments to fall away it is not necessary for anything within your experience to look or feel a certain way simply begin to open your heart to the simplicity and perfection of this very moment allowing yourself to be exactly as you are right now also keep in mind that with the all meditations you are always in control the power to visualize to manifest and to embody is yours and yours alone so allow now the energy of the forest to simply guide you into deeper knowings that already exists within you know that whatever sensations feelings or thoughts that may arise are entirely natural you simply witness them before allowing them to pass drawing yourself further into the enchanted forest you are about to discover so just take a few more fully aware breaths preparing the body for deep rest and relief of all stress tension and anxiety as the mind and body softens further into a state of tranquility slowly allow visions of a dense forest to grow within your mind's eye at the foot of this dream the richness of complex soil systems form the ground beneath you and out of this magical earth sprouts elaborate greenery trees shrubs flowers and vines allow the wildness of this forest to grow and then eventually steady out drawing you into the lush beauty and complete stillness of the forest take a few deep breaths here allowing the forest air to fill the entirety of your lungs [Music] with each inhalation notice yourself becoming infused with nature's healing powers and with each breath out witness yourself releasing some sensations of stress or tension into the healing air around you binding yourself now standing or sitting within an opening in these woods continue to take slow and deep breaths here allowing yourself to be in the majesty of the forest you are entirely safe and supported within these woods knowing that nothing here can harm you you open yourself up quite naturally to the messages that come your way in the stillness of this moment this deep forest within you hear a gentle stirring in the dense woods before you slowly and with grace a deer emerges into the opening you resting she is gentle and soft footed presenting no threat to your well-being the two of you watch one another with an incredible openness that permeates the core your being rehearsed soft movements you begin to see that she is here to bestow her wisdom upon you the gift of softness kindness and grace [Music] this deer grants you the ability to harness your intuitive capabilities within this reawakening of intuition you know it is a safe place to gently release the entanglements of the mind that may be fogging over your clearest visions you might like to take a few deep breaths here allowing the mind to be released on each exhalation the deer departs lowly and you were left with her softness and the trace of her silent footing you begin to breathe more deeply and the mind begins to loosen its grasp all of the breath here for a few moments allowing it to carry you deep into the richness of this present moment with each inhalation you are nourished and with each exhalation you are freed from the confines of the mind you rest once more in the peaceful opening of the woods this time an animal makes itself seen not from its footing on the earth floor but rather as it soars above the dense canopy the eagle flies overhead with strength courage and clear-sightedness you watch in awe as it flies between earth and the cosmos as if it were the king of this forest or the king of the open air the Eagle comes as a messenger to reveal a human connection to the divine by way of its appearance here it bestows upon you the gift of power of healing and of wisdom you begin to feel divinely connected to the forest to these animals and to the energy that swirls around you to spirit or to the universe knowing that you are supported by something higher than yourself you begin to release further into this present moment stress or anxiety carried in the body or mind continue to melt away you come the sense that within the grand scheme of the universe the tension that you carry no longer serves you you release it gently into the air with each out breath as the eagle slowly disappears from sight you are left with an awareness of this magical connection between body mind and spirit so in this moment continue to breathe mindfully you draw yourself again and again breath by breath into this present moment within the space of this forest you continue to breathe in the healing air releasing that which no longer serves you to the woods to be transformed you find yourself resting more comfortably and with greater ease in this present moment [Music] your connection to the forest is deepening as you become more settled within its environment you feel inspired by the animals and greenery that nourishes you here and you are fully open to whatever may come knowing that nothing can harm you in any way just before you an agile Lynx emerges from the woods she's quiet and contemplative and she watches you with knowing eyes the Lynx has incredible insights and strong intuition his highly instinctive encourages you to trust your own instincts in the same way she bears the gift of solitude of patience and of caution the Lynx remind you that there is nothing to be done in this instant all that she asks is for you to pay attention with discernment slowly your path unfolds itself with her grace you'll gently be guided along the way or that you are required to do now in this moment is to relax and listen as she disappears into the density of the forest the Lynx leaves you in solitude the air is quiet now and you are beginning to revel in the stillness and silence that is within you as you tune in now gently following your breath you come into contact with the joy and freedom within this very moment as you gently follow your breath you come into contact with this very moment what emotions do you feel here you might feel joy you might feel sadness you might not feel anything and this is all perfectly okay at this moment just allow the outside world to melt away as you experience a deeper sense of peace within sink into this moment a little bit further using your breath to continually ground you in this present moment remind yourself that with each inhalation you are deeply nourished and with each exhalation you softly unnaturally release any stress or tension [Music] as the light begins to fall away behind the trees a calming energy comes over the forest within the center of it you feel yourself to be quiet at home connected deeply with everything that it holds before the light fades away you catch sight of something moving delicately and gently through the air above the most vibrant butterfly you of ever witnessed litters there is dancing peacefully and radiantly through the air around her a complete embodiment of her own radiance she carries the message of joy lightness and transformation the butterfly is not always been this way before opening her wings she spent a period of time within a hardened shell during this period of non movement she transformed bringing her to a place where she is now littering through the lush forest very much alive as the night falls the butterfly leaves you with the feeling of inspiration and a growing faith in the unfolding journey held within the innate wisdom of this ever-changing journey you soften ever more deeply into the unknown see if you can allow all stress and tension to melt away just trusting in this moment a natural flow of the universe light turns to darkness and still you stay there within this forest you are at peace here Elden nourished by the free air around you as you breathe you begin to release any tension that might be still tucked away within this body now lying comfortably on the forest floor you scan the body gently allowing any sensation of discomfort to naturally dissipate see if you can witness all of your stress and anxiety melting away into the ground beneath you you are at one at peace in this moment with the natural flow of the world around you Eldar nourished within the opening of the forest you are gently rocked to sleep the wind caresses your skin and continues to breathe itself through you the air is warm on this summer night and your body is completely at ease you notice the faintest sounds of the forest as they lull you to sleep [Music] before fading into a peaceful slumber you hear a wolf howling in the distance there is no fear within you at hearing this sound rather you feel a divine connection to this Wolf's voice you know deep down that this wolf will not harm you and that it is here to guide you his sound calls to you to remind you that you were divinely connected and supported he is a symbol of guardianship loyalty and courage highly instinctive creatures woofs rely on their own inner knowing and this too is the gift they provide you the wolf's voice appears now to remind you to trust your own inner workings to follow your heart and trust your gut is how radiates through your being as you begin to embody greater courage trust and strength unfolding subtly moment to moment breath by breath embodying this wisdom you allow yourself to sink all the way into this present moment you release every ounce of stress and tension allowing the wisdom of your body to carry you into a deeply healing and restorative sleep you know intuitively that there is nothing to be done in this moment and nothing to be achieved continue to follow the breath you sink deeper and deeper into this body nothing else matters nothing else pulls you in any direction the breath gently carries you into sleep as your mind drifts away you are at peace beginning to take comfort in your sleep letting go letting go [Music] [Music] [Music]
1 hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to visualize your highest self as well as the dreams and goals of your highest intent as you listen to this meditation each night over the course of the next 28 days profound inner shifts and changes will take place this meditation holds the power to change your life helping you to establish new ideas and beliefs about who you really are so I invite you to open your heart to this journey as you move down the path towards your highest self before we begin I invite you to silence all device notifications and set any morning alarms that are required ensure that the blinds are drawn and that all other end of day activities are taken care of and bring yourself into a comfortable lying down position and allow your entire body to just let go and sink into the surface beneath you you might like to make any final movements or adjustments necessary to bring complete comfort to your physical body take a few deep breaths in and out as you settled into this space I invite you now to quietly explore the silent space within by drawing your awareness to your breathing follow its movement into the body and then back out as habitual thoughts begin to loosen their grip just follow the simplicity of the breathing this energetic life force that functions continuously without your need to control it there is nothing you need to consciously do in order to breathe it is a force that effortlessly guides itself by drawing our attention to it we begin to refocus the mind on the present moment using the breath as an anchor to draw us into the ever unfolding reality of right now expand now your field of awareness by observing your connection to the physical world beneath you witness the entire body being warmly held by the earth as you rest here in complete stillness as night falls the earth offers us a chance to release everything the day has required of us inviting us to sink into a period of restoration and rejuvenation as you become aware of the environment through your sense of touch you begin to feel more deeply rooted and connected to this human life allow yourself this moment of peace by feeling into the blessing and benefits of the Setting Sun and the stillness and stability of the earth beneath you in this very moment [Music] the moment we are born into this human form we begin to accumulate ideas about who we are and what we are capable of these ideas turn into beliefs which turn into actions that create our reality however the truth of the matter is that we are not whatever our thoughts have limited us to be when we start to unravel a complex web of stories we have told ourselves again and again we free up space for our truest and highest self to shine through if the mind attempts to analyze or rationalize your stories I invite you to gently let go of this mental action as you move into the heart space old beliefs will naturally begin to unravel themselves exposing what exists deep beneath the surface of who you think you are so draw your breath into the heart now each time limiting thoughts arise about who you are where you have been or where you are going gently guide these notions down to the heart to be transformed as you witness them arising silently repeat these thoughts I see you and I release you I see you and I release you I see you and I release you each time you release preconceived notions about who you are you free up empty space for new life to emerge from without seeding any new ideas just yet take some time to simply revel in the silence and the emptiness of the world within and it's a soothing emptiness that grows more apparent as each limiting notion of who you are untangles itself from your core [Music] draw your awareness to your stomach noticing the way the breath causes your belly to rise and to fall on the breath out alongside each full breath cycle continue to ground yourself in this moment through the breath allowing it to remind you of what is most real that is your direct experience of this present moment now as you breathe focus your attention on the following words helping you to deeply reaffirm the belief that you are far more than any limiting self notions and that you are capable of achieving your truest dreams and goals so alongside each breath silently whisper to yourself I create my life from within I create my life from within I create my life from within take a few moments of silence now to sink deeply into the truth of these words repeating them softly and slowly begin to notice your entire body becoming more relaxed and then draw your awareness to your toes very slowly begin to carry your attention upwards throughout the body and as you pass each area of your physical being observe any areas where they may be lingering tension or tightness and silently whisper I see you and I release you to each area that requires your loving attention once you have reached the top of your head bring the entire physical body into your awareness the mind included once again quietly compassionately and non-judgmentally repeat these words I see you and I release you I see you and I release you I see you and I release you a deep sense of lightness and freedom will begin to overcome you just take a few deep breaths into this sensation allowing it to run through your entire being now with your highest self quietly radiating outwards I invite you to begin to consider what new version of yourself is waiting to emerge what dreams or goals are ready to be brought to fruition take a few moments of silence here as you allow images and dreams to come to you there is no need to actively seek anything out there is also no right or wrong ideas that might come to the surface simply allow your heart to speak allowing its purest and highest intent to come to your awareness through words and images observe them as they arise [Music] also becoming aware of any attempt the mind might make to intervene refrain from making plans from assessing plausibility from arguing or judging what arises just allow yourself to unconditionally explore whatever comes up for you now begin to visualize yourself in a small stretch of open space in the middle of a forest observe the wildlife that flourishes around you observe the colors the textures the sounds and the aromas open all of your senses to this space feeling into the wild freedom of this natural landscape [Music] you standing firmly rooted into the earth you reach into your pocket and pull out three seeds just take a moment to observe these seeds noting how miraculous seeds really are these tiny nuggets of material hold the power and incredible potential to transform into something completely different than what they might appear to be in their present form and you too have seeds inside of you that are waiting to be planted so take a moment to bring to mind three intentions of your highest self of your purest heart consider the words and images that came to you in the silent and spacious void created after limiting thoughts and beliefs had been released what are your highest goals who are you ready to become now with the first intention in mind silently whisper your vision to one of your seeds take a moment to thoughtfully plant this intention into the seed and then as you bend down dig a small hole with your bare hands once you have prepared the soil for your first seed place the seed in the space created and gently cover it up with the fertile earth take a moment to bless this seed offering it the energy it needs to blossom into full potential and then come to rest in silence once again in this opening in the forest draw your second intention to mind and bestow it upon your second seed crouching down once again create a space in the earth for your seed to grow roots plant the seed and then cover it with soil offer this newly planted intention all of the love and support it will need to grow into fruition and then return to silent awareness of the enchanted forest you are Hin finally observe the third seed resting in the palm of your hand and whisper your third and final intention or dream to it [Music] breathe through the heart as you bless this seed with unconditional love and then as you did for the rest dig a small hole in the earth and then plant your seed as you cover the hole up with rich soil observe a lightness coming over your entire being your dreams have now been seeded so take a few final moments to send positive vibrations to the earth and the seeds that are planted there knowing that change is happening in this very moment witness the body relaxing and the breath deepening as a subtle transformation frees you of whatever once held you back now gently release the image of yourself in this fertile forest knowing that you will come back here again and again night after night to plant these energetic seeds of your highest intention keep these intentions in mind for replanting but also allow flexibility in your intentions as complex human beings we are multifaceted creatures with numerous ways of expressing ourselves and of living our lives the ways in which you can live wholeheartedly are boundless the possibilities are infinite return to your breath allowing its steady and subtle rhythm to carry you into a state of deep relaxation there is nothing left for you to do nothing for you to visualize so allow all thoughts to melt away surrender your dreams to the world around you knowing that the universe has already heard your calls your highest self is in the making and as you come into sleep transformation will continue to unfold focus your attention on your breath as you fall asleep or you may alternatively choose to reaffirm the truth that the power to recreate yourself and your life exists inside of you quietly repeat I create my life from within I create my life from within I create my life from within surrender to the universes mysterious process and wisdom knowing that you are unconditionally supported loved and held in this very moment a new you is being birthed right now
1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this sleep meditation hypnosis over the course of the next few minutes we will journey through four different environments exploring peace and relaxation in the context of each one of them at the end you will have the freedom to select the right one for you attuning your spiritual surroundings to what you need for health healing and your happiness with this in mind allow a calm sense of expectation to rise in your mind and set an intention to rest deeply and completely feel your body relaxed more than it has in a long while all the tension in your body dissolving bit by bit let every muscle in your body relax even those in the place you normally hold tired this may be your forehead your lips or jaw the back of your head your shoulder blades your lower back your belly your knees or ankles and right down to the tendons in your feet feel your whole body melt into wherever you rest and allow the surface around you to support your body let's begin our meditation so lying down keeping your back straight as much as you can feel your body becoming more serene you are still and peaceful in this breath and the next as you relax you begin to hear the crash of water in the distance as you sink a little deeper into relaxation it grows louder until you yourself are standing on the banks of an enormous waterfall it is morning and the sunlight catches the water as it falls creating thousands of tiny rainbows in the spray around the cliff the rumble of moving water is at once both soothing and awe-inspiring a symphony of Earth's very essence tumbling around you take a moment to breathe in this majesty [Music] [Music] as you look more closely at the waterfall bill the cool mist envelop your face leaving dewy droplets on your cheeks and Florida feel the vitality and power of this place all around you in the warmth of the cliff bases the gentle glow of the Sun the frothy water around the Falls notice yourself becoming karma beginning to let go of your worries and physical tension allow yourself to breathe letting the rush of the water guide you into a deeper relaxation allow yourself to feel the slow transitions from inhale to exhale and from exhale to inhale note the tiny delicate paws in the center of these transitions that space where inhalation ends but before exhalation begins breathe as deeply or as shallowly as comfortable for you your chest moving rhythmically and effortlessly as you sink a little deeper into relaxation letting go of any worry or stress if at any time your mind wanders simply bring it gently back to your breath a calming gentle process of bringing air into your lungs feel any tension in your body lift away with every breath you take nothing can hurt you here enjoy these next few moments next to the waterfall letting your worries dissolve under the relentless rumble of fresh rainwater [Music] [Music] as you notice the sounds of the meditation begin to change allow your imagination to follow your feelings to follow creating around you a magnificent sandy beach waves break in crystalline sprays and the call of seagulls eases your mind smell the sharp tang of salt and the warm dustiness of hot sand let your shoulders droop and your fora done crease in the background you can hear the wash of the ocean waves breaking on the beach you can watch the water if you like or close your imaginary eyes and simply dwell in the presence of your other senses breathe and listen let everything else go so much of meditation is the practice of letting go of accepting that you cannot control everything around you of welcoming in the infinite glorious possibilities and opportunities that are waiting for you letting go of your conscious discipline your task oriented nature is the gateway to relaxation so taking a breath in and exhale letting go of the need to control your experience just for a few minutes allow yourself to feel whatever arises letting go of everything negative and treasuring the beauty of this moment's experience as your body lets go of any tension your breath slows down and it may deepen just a slight bit simply follow its rhythm listening to the quiet in and out of air in your lungs if you would like match your breath to the tempo of the sea nearby following the rise and fall of the waves behind whatever feels most comfortable most relaxing and embrace it this is your chance to discover and choose whatever you need to rest most fully and again as the music and sounds of this meditation begin to change allow yourself to be transported to the banks of a freshwater brook or river where fish jump and the sunlight glints on the wet rocks as you take a deep inhale you breathe in the burbling sound of water on stones and the gentle sigh of wind in the young tree boughs take another deep breath and then release it relishing the warmth of the air that leaves your body feel your feet sink into the soft grass of the riverbank and notice the bright green color of early spring if you would like you may dip your foot into the stream noticing the way the water washes over your toes cooling your skin you can hear a few honeybees buzzing about enjoying the landscape as much as you are you know that the bees will not harm you and so you can continue to enjoy the gentle harmony they make a soft sound that sets off the silver tinkling music of the creek a little way in front of you a butterfly flutters on the breeze dipping and soaring with the invisible current of the wind you hold out your hand and it floats closer to you landing on your skin with an almost imperceptible touch allow yourself to lay down on the riverbanks feeling the way the grass molds around your body supporting your back and neck so you can relax more completely above you you can see a fluffy white cloud a clear blue sky all around you are the sounds of nature peaceful and rhythmic your thoughts disappeared replaced by this music of nature you can feel all the aches and pains in your body dissolve away as you sink a little deeper into the warm grass relaxed and at peace in this beautiful landscape give yourself permission to enjoy it as you breathe you feel yourself growing lighter more relaxed almost as if the stresses and tensions of the day are being washed away in the cheerful sound of the river breathe in welcoming inspiration and peace breathe out exhaling worry and fear this is your time embrace it now in these next few moments and now as the music and sounds around you change one small breathe in and find yourself on the path of a majestic and ancient forest the trail through the forest is verdant lined with the carpet of the grass your feet sink into it's slightly brushing against the soft coolness of its surface birds sing in the trees a symphony of natural beauty some chirp back and forth others trill melodies into the wind a gentle breeze sways in the trees and the soft touch of its passing soothes your skin the sunshine is less bright here dappled and soft instead of its usual brash gold the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to and yet it is a soothing coolness filled with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss [Music] [Music] as you walk further and deeper into the forest the trees become larger their trunks wider and spaced further apart in the resulting space hangs a mantle of pearly fog floating a few feet above the ground as you walk your legs stir the fog and it swirls around you gauzy tendrils lazy soft against your skin birdsong accompanies you along your journey lifting your spirit and soothing your body with its innocent sounds let your self marvel at the size of these trees as wide around as dining tables and almost taller than your eyes can see smell the dampness of believes and dirt underneath them nourishing and protecting their roots imagine how far these tree's roots must extend into the earth in order to remain sturdy and upright above all allow the nature's music to guide you into further relaxation as you breathe deeply watching the sunlight meander back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze bring your attention to yourself are you holding any tension or is there any pain in your body are you carrying or holding on to something in your back your neck or your shoulders is there tension in your hips or perhaps the way you squeeze your eyelid shut how does it feel to be you right now you are still and tranquil United with this peaceful an ageless environment feel your body relaxing as you breathe a little deeper letting go of anything that might distract you let yourself focus completely on the beauty of the forest sense it feel what it's like welcoming the harmony and stillness that accompanies it [Music] allow your attention to travel across your body noticing how deeply your muscles and tendons have relaxed since now the space between your thoughts the ease with which your mind moves between thoughts never lingering too long on one subject you feel calm peaceful and daddy's now in this state of quiet peace as this meditation spoken part comes to an end allow your mind to return to that place savoring the beautiful details as you sink further into this state of happy equanimity let your breath guide you and enjoy the final moments of music as you drift off into a deep and peaceful sleep rest well my friend rest well you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] [Laughter] below and welcome my friends my name is Jason Stevenson and thank you for joining me on this sleep meditation golden stars astral heights meditation this meditation is unlike any other meditation I have previously done as this meditation is being guided with the help of my guided spiritual adviser David [Music] so I asked you to find a comfortable position lying down preferably with your back straight wriggling around finding yourself finding that space where you can lay comfortably and breathe with ease begin the meditation by taking in three deep breaths in through the nose sending that breath all the way down to the lower belly area and releasing letting go just do this a few more times and when you are done returning your breathing back to a comfortable rhythm that is natural for you I need to try to change it just be with your breath enjoy the sensation of that breath as it passes through your nostrils sending it down and feeling it as it releases through your nostrils once more if at any time during this meditation your thoughts wander away from my voice you simply just have to acknowledge that thought and your job is simply to bring your focus back to your breathing in and out this meditation does not have to be complex in any way our job is simply to allow our mind to fall away to give it rest for the day whilst we allow our heart and spirit to open and surrender [Music] so for these next few moments simply being with your breath you may feel your stomach rising and falling maybe the sides of your belly rising and falling or your lower back area expanding on the breath in contracting on the breath out [Music] really connect with your breathing just be here and enjoy this process and I will return in a few moments time [Music] I would like you now to visualize a golden light that is pouring in from the top of your head and it's beginning to fill you and pour all the way down your entire body it's a shining golden light and as it pours in it soothes you calms your mind and relaxes you feel it as it travels down your face relaxing your facial muscles your eyebrows your forward nose and cheeks and your eyes and eye sockets just allowing them to feel heavy and relaxed down into your throat and your shoulders and now filling your arms down to your elbows your forearms wrists and right down to your hands and fingertips you may even feel a tingling sensation within your fingers and if you do just allow that to be you don't have to judge that or try to name that just accept that as it is and coming back up your harms your shoulders and down now that the golden light continues to spill down to your chest area your stomach and your shoulder blades and your spine running down your spinal cord releasing all tension and allowing you to relax deeply [Music] the golden light is continuing to pour in and runs down now to your pelvis area your groin your buttocks just allowing it to soften and relax no tension and your thighs the tops of your thighs the backs of your thighs your knees behind your knees and down your calf muscles your shins and pouring down into your feet soles of your feet the bridge of your feet right down into the very tips of each toe filling them up one by one and this light begins to fill your entire body now it's moving up and back up your feet your shins your calf muscles billing your body soothing your body relaxing your body getting ready for the most wonderful journey you're about to embark on moving up now to your knees the backs of your knees your thighs your pelvis your groin buttocks up to your stomach area your lower back feeling at all let go if there are any knots within your stomach feeling them loosen and untie moving up to your chest and your shoulders and seeing from your fingertips your wrists elbows upper arms filled with this golden light moving up to your throat and your face your neck and right along your back your back softening lengthening and right up to the tip of your head beginning to overflow now this golden light [Music] keep breathing keep breathing vo this overflow now begin to pour outside of your body encompassing your entire body nikka of gold and sparkling light refracting all shades of gold and sparkles of gold beginning to drip down onto your bed showering down [Music] helping you to release everything from your mind to empty your mind to unlearn what you've learned today to forgive any grudges or resentments of health today to release them because just right now they don't serve you and we're here to serve you but like you now to visualize there's gold and light beginning to pulse through your body from the top of your head in waves right down to the tips of your toes feel it vibrating pulsing through and this golden light pulsing now delivering an energy a healing energy a positive energy there's going to be with you for this meditation to heal you on many forms emotionally mentally physically giving you what you need for these next few moments [Music] [Music] this vibration now begins to quicken and as it gets faster begins to pause through your body at a faster rate you begin to feel lighter and lighter almost like you are lifting off your bed beginning to rise above your bed and you are so be it you are you continue to rise above your bed and even if you look back for a moment you can see that you are there your body is there lying down now over you your eternal spirit it's beginning to rise further and further up and away from your body you are safe in this zone because you are simply loved you begin now to pass through the roof of where you once were passing through with ease with grace you keep moving up and up further enjoying the floating feeling of being free from all worries concerns and restrictions of the physical body your mind is free you're moving up into an amazing astral plane where you can look back and begin to see not only your house but the community that you live in the lights below twinkling looking oh so peaceful and you continue to rise rising above looking back down seeing cities seeing countryside's seeing your entire country and the waters surrounding your country moving out into another expanse reaching another plane a plane of space a plane of nothingness and yet everything loading drifting you are like a golden ball of vibrating energy showering from you sparks of love harmony and peace falling away going back to the earth as you continue to rise moving up now you begin to see the curvature of the world of the earth how beautiful it looks from here and from here realizing that your troubles and concerns that you may have had seemed oh so trivial now almost non-existent you simply continue to float to drift into this ever expansive consciousness a space that is set aside for you a space where you are connected to all that is and all that ever was [Music] [Music] here you have time to reflect on what really is important in your life and an answer that keeps calling to you over and over again is love love for who you are love your family love your friends and love and the God sauce that is within you and without guiding you protecting you and keeping you safe what you are now is true human spirit and a mass of potential you are vibrating at a light frequency it continued to rise more moving up and away from the galaxy that which you existed and into higher realms of space pure ecstasy and bliss your soul is a pure vibration stage [Music] vibrating love healing and eternal consciousness when you consider any worries that you may have had that you have been carrying around with you you allow them now to completely fall away from you in this etheric body you're now in any thoughts of worries or concerns simply not important and not relevant on this plane if you've had any health issues right where you are now in this existence you are pure 100% health white light your cells are healing rebuilding themselves regrouping and buzzing with positive energy and light your cells are reconnecting not only with yourself but with everything else around

[Music] he may begin to make out shapes of where you live your community your city or country shifting down and from where you are now looking down on your house beginning to just gently slow down and with ease you just appear to slip through the roof you've had any worry or concern back into the room where you began this meditation back on to the bed you were on or the floor reconnecting to your body sensing your body you may like to wiggle your fingers and toes to bring you back in this moment reconnecting to your breath to your breathing breathing in and out breathing in and out breathing

1 grounding meditation hello and welcome to this guided meditation my name is Jason Stevenson and over the course of the next 30 minutes or so we will find stability and groundedness returning from whatever thoughts hopes and worries phoebus from feeling in the present moment you might choose to listen to this meditation before bed right when you wake up in the morning or as a break in an otherwise really busy day however you choose to approach this recording is absolutely right for you just allow your eyes to close your breathing to deepen and your body to relax make sure you're in a comfortable position where you won't be disturbed for the next 30 minutes or so and taking three deep breaths to begin with breathing all the way and sending that breath all the way down to your diaphragm area holding for a few seconds and then letting it all come out release all your hair and do this another two times as you breathe a little deeper imagine now that you were standing in a grassy field tiny green plants sparkling with Jun cushioning your feet with their soft leaves and above you the sky is spotless blue and you can hear a few birds singing around you it is morning and it's the start of a beautiful day as you stand in this place allow yourself to truly feel all that is around you [Music] notice the temperature of the air on any exposed skin the sunshine or wind against your body [Music] take note of the smells damp soil dewy leaves [Music] can you hear any birds possibly crickets or perhaps honeybees [Music] gaze into the distance allowing your imagination to sharpen the scenery around you into an intensely detailed beautiful landscape and then when you are ready allow yourself to feel what it is like within your own body at this very moment where do your muscles and tendons hold pain or tension do you hold your face taut or your shoulders slumped I'd like you to take these few moments and truly notice how you feel treating yourself with kindness not not trying to change anything this is a snapshot of you a portrait captured in this moment just give yourself permission to become familiar with it [Music] and now as you become attune to your body allow your consciousness to turn to your mind as best as you are able allowing yourself to observe your brain its thought patterns and impulses without actively participating in them [Music] it's almost like you are viewing a sporting match or a television show you can see what is happening you can point things out or cheer on certain thoughts but you have no need to change or influence though at this moment you're simply watching the move past in whatever shapes or patterns they happen to take on [Music] if you find yourself getting sucked into a particular dilemma or worry simply exhale blow it out and bring your consciousness back to spectating observing as you observe your thoughts you will notice that certain hopes reminders and even worries continue to appear some may tempt you more than others some may be easier to let go of pay attention to the persistent ones and if they appear again ask yourself if these thoughts manifest themselves in your body you may notice anger in your chest or stress your hips but no matter how these emotions present themselves take heed oftentimes almost chronic pain is nothing more than a learned response to a series of emotions take these few moments now and simply stay with what you are feeling allowing yourself to be conscious of the way it affects your mind and physical body [Music] when you were ready taking a deep breath and exhale sighing out all the frustration tension and destructiveness within you do not be afraid to make a sound simply allow your exhale to wash it out of you cleansing your body in mind like a warm healing wave I'd like you to do this five more times noticing how you become progressively more relaxed increasingly more relieved with each passing moment feeling yourself becoming present anchored in the gentle endless rhythm of your own respiration and now as you stand in this lush green field imagine that your feet are growing roots majestic powerful roots that grow into the soil holding you Ferland strong in this idyllic place see these roots going down as they reach further into the ground they split off forming a vast network of tendrils that will hold you firm in even the greatest weeds roots that will nourish and protect you through even the darkest winters and stronger storms [Music] these roots extend hundreds of feet into the dirt growing around rocks and boulders passing through soil that has not seen the Sun for many centuries they cross the paths of other tree's roots touching them gently in greedy growing together yet respecting each trees individual space and root paths you are rooted in the most beautiful place your face turned toward the warm Sun and your roots nestled in cool rich soil and now as you take your next breath in imagine that your legs and torso are being wrapped gently in bark a soft form-fitting covering that will protect you from all the hazards that life has to offer you you know that you may return to your human form whenever you would like and so this is a soothing process almost as if you were being draped in the softest blanket imaginable you wiggle your toes peeling your roots bar below ground nestling into the dirt you shrug your shoulders feeling the comfortable durability of bark all around you you have walked this earth for many years experiencing the joys and challenges that each day has to bring you you have earned your bark the golden cloak shot through with silver that warms you every day of your life breathe a little deeper and listen to the sounds of birds and nature all around you you stretch your arms out and as you do they fan into branches branches white with a spring whiteness of apple blossoms this time in your life is busy stressful even but in this space you are able to reach for the heavens celebrating the joy and space in every present moment as you inhale notice the delicate aroma of the small white flowers [Music] breathe in the smell of sunshine and soil and growth and when you are ready turn your head to take in the sights all around you as you look around you realize that you are not standing in a field you are standing in an orchard a nearly endless community of trees right with the hopeful flowers of spring around your trunks long green grass grows a rock bright and in your branches bluebirds see you are not the only tree you are a part of a community a beautiful and vibrant orchard that grows together so often our lives feel as if they are only about us moments of pain and suffering of a distancing from that which matters most of us can be excruciating and yet even these sensations are a part of the rhythm of the seasons of the processes each of us undergoes many times throughout our lives [Music] we each have periods of flowering of new leaves and possibilities for the future [Music] we have the strong green growth of summer when small apples begin to appear between our bridges and our lives become glossy with gentle rains there is the abundance of fall when our plans and dreams become fruitful the air sweet with the crispness of ripe fruit but there are other times too there is the time when we drop our leaves letting our branches become bare falling into restful silent dormancy [Music] there are the times when the orchard keeper comes pointing out to us the branches that have been withered or split the ones that no longer produce leaves or fruit there is the pain of losing these branches the loss of something that was once creative productive beloved but no matter how agonizing this is there is always that time when new shoots appear tiny branches that stand out electric green with life against our silvery gold trunks and so the cycle continues from flower to fruit to rest and back again and through it all we are rooted solid in our roots and our place in the orchard anchored against the coldest snows sharpest rains strongest gales [Music] no matter what happens our roots hold us steady and our fellow trees brave the elements with us take a few minutes now and allow your body and mind to fully drink in the scene around you the beautiful white and gold expanse of the orchard you have been planted in smell the air be all the Sunshine's warm touch let the sounds of birds and animals guide you into a deeper relaxation the combination of wind and soil war and cold motion and stillness lull you into a total and complete serenity we will continue on together in a few minutes you this this right here in this very moment is the sensation of groundedness with each exhale you feel your body and mind relax a little more with every inhale you breathe in a clarity purpose and peace you are rooted and stable yet free able to reach to all the sky and sway in the breeze and perhaps most importantly you are surrounded by others others who love you and respect you and wish to help you you grow together each unique but journeying toward the same balanced peacefulness strong individually as a whole take these last few minutes of meditation to savor it [Music] and coming back now to the room we began this meditation becoming aware of the cells in this room presently surrounding you beginning to wiggle your fingers and toes awakening your body returning to your body stretching out your muscles every muscle every tender and when you were ready you can open your eyes enjoy your day or evening ahead [Music] you
1 [Music] resting and sleep guided meditation welcome and thank you for joining me for this resting and sleep guided meditation my name is Jason and I sincerely hope you enjoy and experience this meditation as a relaxing rejuvenating and comforting time as we start to breathe we will prepare to spend the next 20 30 minutes or so together the purpose of this meditation will be the creation of a time for you to unwind relax and learn some easy technique for having an experience of restful sleep its resting and sleep guided meditation is a time to be still and aware by using the carlo's of your breath to relax your mind joining your breath and mind together as a team you can experience being refreshed and rested for your time of rest before we begin if you allow yourself to drift off to sleep please be sure the joy in a fully safe and comfortable position you may wish to lean back in the chair or lie down if you have enough space and would feel comfortable there be sure to support and protect your head and if you have any eggs or pains or discomforts position your body thoughtfully to maximize your physical relaxation and ease of breathing to take full advantage of your benefits from participating in this meditation please also silence any alarms and ringers and dim the lights and make your space private one so you can focus on complete relaxation and the sound of my voice you will have the familiarity of feeling your body relaxing and unwinding and drifting off to a restful sleep during this meditation allow your eyes to close or your visual focus to soften into a gaze where your eyes are resting unconnected to the actions in your mind [Music] [Music] in your relaxed position allow your breath to calmly slip in and out of your body like the rolling rhythms of sound and light waves the breath washes over you and relaxes you a little deeper with each exhalation breathing isn't easy action the body will even do it on its own if you allow the natural rhythm to guide you in this sleeping guided meditation you'll open your mind as you've opened your breath and allow your mind to have peace and ease unfocused thoughts or ideas may come to you and they may seem urgent or like they require your attention be assured but for the duration of this guided meditation you may let them pass these thoughts and ideas serve as your reminder that you are a vessel you are receptive to the needs of your environment and the needs of your body but also these needs are separate from your consciousness for the duration of our time together the mind and body can relax and together enjoy this peaceful time of resting through mindful guided relaxation you can gain improved wellness improved personal relationships and improved physical stamina [Music] after finding a comfortable position so you can now relax the entire body we will begin by shifting the use of your senses as we focus or softened each of your senses you can allow yourself to use that change to drift toward a more restful and fulfilling sleep for calming your mind and your body in this guided meditation first we let go of the visual use of your eyes our eyes are often overworked and overlooked for care in this world of artificial light [Music] they are forced to work harder when they had tired and they deserve a rejuvenating rest as much as the rest of your body Afiya is a little well-deserved vacation by relaxing them and their focus of interpreting the visual world around you [Music] if you haven't already done so you may wish to close them entirely or simply soften your gaze so that your surroundings melt into the background of your consciousness [Music] disconnecting from our visual sense brings our awareness in focusing on the benefits of rest for the mind and for the body while it is the job of the eyes to look outward in the guided sleep meditations we wish to see and reveal what is within [Music] in the extremities of your body beginning with the hands and

1 hello and welcome to this guided meditation relaxation for sleep and healing is Jason Stephenson and in this meditation my aim is to help you achieve a healthier body mind and spirit by you using the power of a focused desire and a deep body relaxation during this meditation I'll ask you to focus on different parts of the body and doing so will take you into a deeper state of being so you can better access your subconscious mind and harness its infinite potential people do not realize their own power fortunately for you you are exactly where you must be to exercise your greatest gifts your will and your imagination so please be comfortable lying on your back and keep your back and spine straight so it will not impede your breathing take a few deep breaths to ground and center yourself you just for the moment let go of any expectations as you lie there simply focus on being as relaxed as comfortable as you possibly can if at any point you fall asleep that's fine your subconscious mind will still be able to receive these instructions to help you bring about a healthier body mind and spirit for you so right now I'd like you to focus your attention at the top of your head bring in and on the breath out allowing any pent-up tension to dissolve allow your phorid to relax letting any tightness there vanish next to your eyelids the fleshy part around your eye sockets your temples the back of your head let go you now your lips release any control you may have over them just let your jaw and the fleshy bit beneath your jaw sag as well as your cheeks and your tongue relax your chin the back and front of your neck the way down to the base of your throat you let that relaxed feeling news further down to your shoulders and your shoulder joints and let ease flow down your spine between your shoulder blades into your armpits and your upper back relax your chest and upper arms all the way to your elbows and let your lower arms go and feel them sink deeply into your bed your wrist both left and right let them go and feel the mass of your hands sink deeper into the bed feel your hands let go the bony back part as well as the soft fleshy inside relax your fingers letting them call as they will and same with your knuckles as well as the space between your fingers and the joints of your fingers allow the sides of your chest sag and your solar plexus area around the bellybutton sink deeper into your body allow this feeling to trickle down your stomach the sides of your stomach and your lower back let go of your hips your thighs your groin and buttocks notice your upper legs the top bottom and the sides go relax your knees and the fleshy part behind your knees and allow that feeling now to extend down to your lower legs your carbs and the bony part of your shins relax your ankles and heels letting them dig deeper into your bed relax your feet the top and also the soft instep beneath feeling is now into the balls of your feet boning knuckles of your feet and the soft flesh between your toes relax your toes all of them the joints of the toes all the way to their padded bottoms and tips now shift your focus back to your feet your ankles legs relax upper legs bucks your thighs and groin make your way up to your stomach and lower back further up to your chest and upper back and we're moving back up to the lower arms upper arms shoulders and shoulder joints moving further up to the throat the neck the back of your neck your facial muscles lips mouth tongue relax your eyes and eyelids moving further up to the forward and the back of your head and finally we're back at the top of your head so I'd like you now to let go and bring your focus back to your breathing and don't try to regulate your breath simply breathe a comfortable way for you and just be just stay with this breath for a few moments and if thoughts come and go at this time allow them to come and go put out the welcome mat for those thoughts and all you need to do is simply to let go of the thought by shifting your focus back to your breathing in and out I'll return in a few moments to take you on to the next stage energy from within today the Sun reminds me that I am made

heaviness is the first stage of an exercise called yoga nidra the midway point between wakefulness and sleep many liken it to floating on a calm peaceful waters and here you are safe ear all tension is gone allowing your body to naturally begin its healing process and is as calm as it can be while still conscious so it's also here that you're at your most powerful because it's in this state that the barriers between your conscious and your subconscious mind are at their weakest so let's begin with you now that's not the you that is lying down and breathing expanding with each in-breath and contracting with each out breath no I'm talking to the you that is listening to these words using this bodies is to pick up vibrations and translate into sound I am talking to the you that is feeling these sensations through this body that senses matter through flesh that detects light through eyes I'm talking to you that is independent of these things that animates these things that affects these things but is unscathed by any of them into the you that remains unchanged through all of the seasons of your life and that remains even when this body is unconscious you the real you you are the powerful being that has chosen to live in this body for the time being the ancient one who has lived many lives through countless eons since time began you are the deathless one who creates worlds and strides the universe delighting in the infinity of space to whom matter and time mean nothing one who animates this body through breath and with the same energy that enlivens the cosmos an actor who enjoys the drama you have written and the character you have chosen to act it out with the one who sees without eyes ears without ears and feels without flesh you the true you not the pretend you lying in deep rest as it breathes in and out you have done a wonderful job this life you have created the scenarios you put it through the things that identifies with Jex it calls its own and the co-actors it interacts with are all masterpieces well done it has been a thrilling roller coaster riot of ups and downs and highs and lows just like breath it rises and falls expands and contracts but can it be even better yes again imagine a healthier body one that's robust energetic and strong one that's more flexible rebounds faster and even more full of life feel that feel how wonderful that feels how magnificent our static body like a child again remember childhood supple brimming with irrepressible energy always up to incredible challenges what exuberance and joy each day is an opportunity to enjoy this young body exploding with happiness at every opportunity to move to test one strength to prove one's fitness to the admiration of one and all and the stamina the endless stamina that allows you to run and jump free of aches and pains save for those that come with the joy of exertion after a laughter filled race with friends after gleefully rushing up that grassy hill wet with Dew from the morning after shrieking with joy while running barefoot through those fragrant flowered fields beneath the Sun the mind of childhood endless questions and awestruck wonder at the creation that you are a part of the creation that you played a vital role in making such a mind forgets nothing but everything is a fantastic enigma there is nothing old and tired nothing humdrum and boring wandah piled upon Wanda and the mind reeling with the delicious hunger to know more of what you have wrought or as your co-creator Carl Sagan once said the cosmos is within us we are made of star stuff we're a wave in the universe to know itself so day by day do just that with your mind you explore what you have wrought with your own imagination and will and what you see you delight in for it is all your creation your days and nights are filled with bliss confident in your own power to shape and reshape your world according to your sense of what is fitting for you this knowledge enlivened jus fills every atom in this your body with love with life with peace and with joy for at peace knowing that every bone every muscle every fiber in every cell of this your body had their own wisdom and power greater than any doctors book of knowledge there is no damage that cannot handle no hurt they cannot take care of no need they cannot provide for because they are completely perfect and whole and nights of filled with bliss you are in your own power to shape and reshape your world according to your sense of what is fitting age and live and you fills every atom in your body with love with life with peace and joy you are therefore at peace everyone in your life is there because you have chosen them to be there they are co actors in this drama you have all co-written those who play the antagonist to your character have their role once their purpose has been achieved they will leave your stage to play another role on someone else's call is yours and yours only already know this don't you you were there for at peace knowing that everything in your life is there because you have chosen to have them there they are props that help you play your role to the fullest and when you have no more need of them they must go for that which you have no more need for cannot become and when you desire something it too must come because you know it must you desire it must become the you are a creator and that is why you are a responsible creator careful about what enters the stage of your life and what doesn't what is best for your body your mind your universe and your spirit

1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this chakra balancing meditation that it's aim is to help to bring harmony to your chakras cleansing your aura and guiding you into a deep restorative sleep before we begin I'd like to give you a little bit of a background on the nature of the chakras within the body there are seven main chakras that line the spine we can imagine these chakras as spinning vortexes of energy unseen to the eye they underlie whatever our current experience may be each chakra corresponds to specific organs feelings and behaviors this healing meditation will bring awareness to these energy centers and balance them allowing energy to flow freely in all parts of our body we'll explore these in more detail as we dive into our meditation but for now rest in the knowledge that regardless of how you come into this meditation you will soon bring harmony to each one of these spinning centers of energy to each level of yourself as the chakras begin to balance your overall being will come into greater harmony and transcendence a deep and healing cleanse of your overall aura will take place and soon you will enter into a deep and restful sleep so to begin make sure that you are comfortable you might like to use any cushions or blankets that you need to make sure that your body is prepared to relax fully and sure than any potential distractions such as computers are turned off and that you will not be disturbed as you enter into this healing meditation and sleep once your body is prepared for relaxation allow your mind to follow to invite any lingering thoughts of the day to gently loosen their grip and fall away so let us begin now the tune into your breath in order to guide the mind away from thought let it flow deeply in and out of your body allowing it to renew you in each unfolding moment take a few deep breaths here now on your next inhalation bring your attention to the top of your head and just allowing the breath to follow at its natural rhythm on your next breath in pause for a moment and then allow that exhale to come all the way back down to the base of the spine just breathing slowly and gently continue to pay attention to your breathing for a few more cycles creating a pathway of light of breath along your spine upwards on each inhale and downwards on each exhale allow this breathwork to guide you into a deep state of relaxation now come back to your normal breath allowing it to flow effortlessly through you we'll begin our journey by connecting to the lowest chakra to the root chakra bring your awareness to the base of your spine once more in order to connect with this chakra residing at the pelvic floor this energy center is our base it is from where we harness our sense of support security and safety as we make our way through this journey on earth when the root chakra is balanced we feel grounded and connected to the place we are presently in we feel safe to journey out knowing the deep roots connect us to our inner and outer foundations we can feel the earth steep embrace knowing that the earth provides what we require to live harmoniously the color of this chakra is red take a moment now to breathe deeply into the base of the spine envisioning the warmth of the color red allow it to ground you in the present moment physically emotionally and spiritually know that you are safe here safe to enter into this deep state of relaxation and harmony allow the music my voice your physical world and your inner world to support you begin to introduce slowly and gently the affirmation I am safe and supported I am safe and supported I am safe and supported [Music] continue breathing deeply into the pelvic floor allowing yourself to feel intimately connected to the physical space you rest in sinking Deva to your body [Music] now moving upwards gently guide your attention to the sacral chakra located between the pubic bone and the navel within this swirling vortex of energy we find our sense of creativity intimacy sexuality and connection to others emotions arise from this Center and you may find that as we venture into this space you sense this rising of the emotional world if this is true to your experience at this point or any other moment during this meditation know that you are supported and loved exactly as you are rest in the knowledge that you are being balanced and healed in this very moment simply by allowing the music and these words to permeate your being when the sacral chakra is balanced we experience pleasure abundance joy and warmth we feel intimately connected to those around us and feel harmonious within our relationships we experience the joy of the nature of life the joy of creation so take a moment to envision the color orange now with your attention allow it to permeate this space between your hips just above your pubic bone and feel yourself begin to open up to this warmth and to this healing slowly begin to introduce the affirmation I am connected to others I flow freely I am connected to others I flow really [Music] continue to breathe deeply into the sacral chakra and return to this affirmation as many times as the mind wanders I am connected to others I flow really [Music] we will now continue our ascension to the solar plexus located just above the navel this energy center brings us confidence self-worth and personal power take a moment now to envision this radiant vortex just above the navel ear into its innate power and its warmth [Music] when the solar plexus is balanced we feel a strong sense of purpose motivation and direction when balanced we hold a calm confidence in our ability to manifest the life we desire we move confidently in the direction of our dreams [Music] bring your awareness to the solar plexus now envisioning the radiance and lightness of the color yellow be ovis energy center expanding radiating out from your core and carrying it with a new sensation of aliveness purpose and a sure but subtle strength feel Solar plexis awakening meeting this bright healing yellow light as it grows and expands [Music] now gently introduce the affirmation I radiate confidence I radiate confidence [Music] [Music] [Music] let us move gently now into the heart chakra the home of our innately compassionate and loving nature bring your attention to this space in the center of your chest and envision your heart expanding with each inhale and softening with each exhale [Music] [Music] this middle chakra where our downward moving and upward flowing energies meet in perfect harmony is where our capacity for love resides when balanced we are able to give love unconditionally and we are able to receive the same gift from others and from ourselves [Music] rest now in the simplicity of this beautiful compassionate center envision the color green expanding from the heart with each breath notice the pure energy of the heart radiating outwards healing the heart itself and also the entirety of your being [Music] the hearts message is quite simple take a moment to introduce the affirmation I love and am loved allow it to permeate all cells of your being as you slowly repeat yourself I love and am loved continue to give the heart permission to expand and to soften knowing that it is safe to do so right here right now [Music] gently guide your awareness now up to the throat chakra sitting in the throat area this expansive vortex of energy governs our ability to speak our authentic truth and to listen to that of others allow your attention now to settle here noticing any sensations residing deep in the throat [Music] when the throat chakra is balanced we find a lightness and trust in who we are and find freedom to express our highest truths communication is an open space and an exchange so what we are able to give we are able to receive when balanced we are able to listen compassionately to the true expression of another being begin to envision the color blue expanding from the throat imagining it radiating upwards from where you rest painting the entire sky let it surround you allow your being to flow freely within this vast blue atmosphere [Music] [Music] feel into the lightness of the free air trusting where it gently moves you [Music] gently introduced the mantra I express my truth really i express my truth freely [Music] notice the body becoming lighter as you embrace your expanding authentic being [Music] come now softly to the third eye this energy center swells between your eyebrows and is the Gateway to your inner knowledge take a moment to bring your attention to this space sensing the freely spinning energy exists here [Music] when the third eye is balanced we are able to access our inner knowing and our higher mind with greater ease our perceptions are clearer and our intuition is strengthened we do not need to speak the wisdom that comes at this level we are simply able to witness it and embrace it imagination is heightened as we float effortlessly into this deeper reality [Music] [Music] invision now the powerful color indigo pulsating from the third I simply draw your attention here knowing that there is nothing to figure out nothing to rationalize and nothing to think through just allowing the mind to drift away and let the deeper levels of the mind flow in naturally effortlessly silently introduce the affirmation I see in a wisdom clearly I see in a wisdom clearly allow this truth and the color indigo to bathe and to heal the mind allow yourself to fall further into the depths of your being [Music] [Music] we now come to reach the peak of our scent at the crown chakra bring your attention now to the crown of your head feeling yourself gently opening from this space [Music] this is our connection to the divine to the oneness that connects guides and moves us this space is pure consciousness when the crown balances we come to feel the truth that we are one we feel divinely connected within ourselves and to all that exists outside of us we sense the limitless of pure awareness as our consciousness elevates we feel purity of light the light of pure existence imagine a white light expanding from the crown connecting you to everything that has ever been you are one with the universe intimately linked to it all [Music] [Music] there are no words here there is simply the purity of being you now feel this infinite connection all around you witnessing the energy that expands and flows freely this divine white light begins to expand from your entire being radiating out from every part of you this light this healing light cleanses and heals your aura take a moment to bathe in this lightness in this pure state of existence the universe both within and without has become one in this space there is only pure awareness [Music] [Music] you rest deeper and deeper into this knowledge into this pure state of oneness allowing this healing light to support nurture cleanse and heal you you are witnessing and now experiencing the truth of this existence of this oneness slowly you carry yourself safely gently into the limitless dreamworld of sleep knowing

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to find peace and inner tranquility before you naturally fall into a deep and restorative sleep short while you'll be guided to relax the body and ease the mind before being led through a visual journey into a mystical cave of peace it's your time to allow yourself to be carried away gently through this journey knowing that you are entirely supported in this present moment so take a moment now to ensure that all end of day activities have been wrapped up alarms should be set and liens drawn I invite you now to come into a comfortable lying down position ensuring that your body is resting with ease wherever you are you might want to use blankets or cushions to support you as you find comfort in the physical space you occupy [Music] take a few releasing breaths here allowing a deep sigh to leave your body on your next outward breath [Music] to begin our journey into tranquility take a moment to observe the stillness of your physical body as dei transforms into night and the Sun fades away we are invited to enter a much needed period of rest and rejuvenation as we sink into the stillness of night rest assured there is nothing we need to consciously engage in or take care of we can trust that the body will work by its way of its innate wisdom so take a moment now to quietly observe the miracle of this body [Music] feel into its heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you you might want to notice now where there might still be movement despite the sense of stillness notice where breath brings subtle movement to the body how it causes the chest and stomach to expand on each inhalation and to fall away on each exhalation [Music] observe how beautifully this gentle movement intertwines with a deeper sense of complete stillness as you take a few deep breaths here in silence [Music] if thoughts arise in the mind no that is entirely natural for them to do so as you become aware that your attention has shifted into stories about the past or future simply acknowledge these thoughts from a more distant place than his habit or [Music] while the mind can be useful at times it can lure us into a unproductive thought cycles when left to run on its own terms as we begin to witness our mental movements from a higher or broader vantage point we practice our power of discernment easing challenging thoughts and emotions as we experience greater clarity and a sense of peace [Music] as you journey through this meditation keep this sense of distance in mind as thought arises and returned to your breath as an anchor when needed [Music] move now further into breath awareness as you practice holding your attention on this anchor that is always available to you [Music] notice the breaths wither its pace and its depth as you move alongside it in both directions [Music] hold for a brief pause just a second or two and at the end of each inhalation and each exhalation finding brief moments of complete stillness within each breath cycle [Music] allow the mind to gently subside as you become more attuned to the present moment attachment to worried anxious or distracting thoughts can be released as you practice being the observer of whatever is moving through you just allow yourself to sink further and further into this very moment entering naturally into a state of full-bodied ease and tranquility [Music] with your eyes remaining closed tune into this space between the eyebrows just in front of your mind's eye [Music] envision in this space of vast emptiness something like a clear night sky [Music] sink into this infinite abyss of space and silence for a few moments as you prepare to enter into a cave of complete peace and tranquility [Music] as you gaze with eyes closed into the empty sky in front of you and vision your view dotted with infinite sparkling stars you are in an open outdoor space surrounded by the open air lakes rivers and mountains the moon is high and full [Music] tune into your breath for a few moments noticing the freshness of the air that fills you [Music] just follow my voice for a few breaths here as you inhale deeply breathing in a sense of being completely at ease and exhale slowly releasing any tension or stress in body or mind inhaling again visualizing yourself filling up with peace and ease and exhale fully releasing anything that no longer serves your movement towards complete relaxation breathing deeply once more filling yourself with the freedom and freshness of outdoor air and exhale completely releasing all tension to be transformed by the starlit sky [Music] returned gently to your natural breath allowing your mind to refocus on the empty space in front of your mind's eye [Music] though night has fallen upon this outdoor landscape the land is lit by stars and moonlight granting you with enough light to see the curves of the earth take a moment now to simply observe the way the rocky mountain faced peaks and Falls and the way rivers and lakes gently caressed the hard surface of the earth notice how peaceful it is here beneath the night sky as you feel yourself coming into complete harmony with the natural world from where you stand you see an empty cavern not too far away illuminated by the full moon above its spaciousness its emptiness cause you towards it so you begin to walk slowly and mindfully towards the sheltered space within the mountain [Music] notice the way your feet effortlessly move across the earth you feel completely at home in this natural landscape as you move towards the cave that beckons you quietly [Music] as you reach the opening to this wondrous cave your original sense that it rests unoccupied is confirmed there is no one here but you know plant life inside and no animals the only thing that you have yet to sense within this cave is a deep stillness it is completely silent and yet something about it is calling to you in the faintest whisper recognizable only by your heart [Music] by the entrance of the cave there is a candle placed here by some universal force for whoever might come to rest here you light the candle with a match that has also been provided and quietly make your way inside the dark cavern fear anxiety and worry are completely absent all that is present within you is a growing calmness [Music] he reached the center of this mystical cave that has called you into it setting your candle in the center and bringing yourself to rest comfortably on the floor lying on your back you stare up at the ceiling noticing the incredible edges carved by nature breathing deeply and feel entirely at peace in this open and empty space [Music] silence surrounds you as the mind rests in a deep state of peace and tranquility your breath continues to flow through you effortlessly and gracefully [Music] yet within this vast silence something in this cave is speaking to you the mind cannot decipher it but the heart knows that there is a great wisdom radiating out from these walls you listen more intently to this language still foreign to the mind and find that your heart begins to open up the serenity of this space softens your heart as a deep trust infiltrates your entire being in this serene state you find a calm and the quiet sense of courage to ask this cave any questions that might arise from your purest heart [Music] as you allow your heart to ask these wise walls any questions that arise you find that the questions themselves are infused with trust rather than with fear and anxiety your heart speaks calmly and quietly the mind resting peacefully in the background and as you listen closely with your heart remaining open you find that the walls speak back in silent whispers gently wisely and compassionately this is the language of the heart and you open yourself to it completely [Music] you do not have to search for any answers you trust that they will come in their own time patience and peace arise within you [Music] the cave sends its wisdom in the form of whispers visions and inner sensations though not all at once this mystical cave knows that some answers require extra time to be revealed and that when the time is right the answers will be provided you open your heart even wider sinking further into the peaceful and serene energy of this cave spend a few more silent moments listening to the wisdom of the wars that surround you the mind remains quiet as the heart remains receptive [Music] coming now to a deeply settled state you turn your head to blow out the candle that is beside you your mind is calm your heart is warm and your spirit is nourished notice a deep trust arising within you a completely calm presence radiates throughout your entire being all at once there is no separation between you and this mystical cave an overwhelming sense of oneness comes over you as you sink further and further into this deep tranquility of darkness your body returns to the physical reality of the room that you rest in witness the surface now your body rests on observing quietly all the tangible items supporting you here and now [Music] feel into this supremely calm state allowing your breath to rock you closer and closer towards sleep all images melt away from the heart and mind as you come back to a place of deep physical presence notice the air around your body the warmth of blankets and cushions the heaviness of your limbs your torso your head and the rest of your body [Music] each breath travels deeply into your lungs transporting vital life energy to every cell of your body you can rest with ease knowing that as you sleep this process is being taken care of by the bodies and Nate wisdom there is nothing else for you to do nothing else for you to ask think believe or create all that the heart yearns for now is this deep sense of peace and contentment to carry you into a peaceful night's sleep as you breathe your conscious awareness begins to melt away asleep comes to restore your entire being [Music] continue to follow the breath quietly and effortlessly until everything slips away soon you will enter into a peaceful slumber where the caves mystical energies will replenish you entirely mind body and heart

sensations help you to arrive in the present moment just spend a few moments noticing them without judgment notice if the mind wants to label your experience as good or bad right or wrong and then simply let those labels go as you breathe out coming back to the very simple practice of just noticing [Music] and now take a moment to notice your physical body beginning by drawing your attention to the top of your head from here gently start to scan your body downwards noticing if there are any areas of tension that you might be able to soften or release just simply let any physical tension start to dissolve into the surface beneath you as if it were melting away as we move through this practice you will likely notice that from time to time negative thoughts worries or other unhelpful ideas and images might rise to your awareness these fearful or negative thought patterns are the very things that stand in the way of our experiencing deep peace positivity and relaxation now what typically happens when negative or worried thoughts arise is one of two things first we might find ourselves becoming completely swept up by these mental stories when we are not mindful of these thought patterns they can weigh heavily on our sense of well-being and then a second type of relationship we might have with these thoughts is one of avoidance and suppression avoidance and suppression however are not long-term solutions to troublesome or racing thoughts if what we are after is deep peace positivity and contentment we must first cultivate a more nourishing balanced relationship with our thoughts and from here we can explore the possibility of welcoming positive energy and ideas into our consciousness so as thoughts arise during this meditation i invite you to witness these occurrences as if you were an outside observer of them rather than being caught up in the stream itself consider that you are standing at the side of the riverbank watching mental objects come and watching them go practice this for a few moments on your own now before we move deeper into our salt cave visualization to cultivate positive energy and a deep sense of peace simply observe any thoughts that arise with care and maintaining a subtle gap between them and yourself if certain thoughts seem to have a heavy pull you might alternatively guide these thoughts down to the center of your heart to be released focusing your attention on this loving center in your chest now to cleanse yourself more completely before we step into our visualization i invite you to take three long deep breaths and releasing with a soft sigh through the mouth on each exhalation after that final exhalation let your breath return to its natural rhythm and your attention to turn towards the creative capacity of your mind [Music] within your creative mental space you find yourself now on a rural road both sides lined with summer trees in full blossom aromas of jasmine and lavender dance through the air filling your heart and mind with each full breath the dirt road you are on heads north weaving through the fertile land in the direction of a sweet sanctuary a salt cave spa where you will rest deeply for the night to come all you carry with you is a small backpack of belongings an open mind and a vibrant heart slowly and gently you walk down the country road in the direction of the peaceful retreat absorbing the natural landscape that holds you as you journey you admire the vibrancy and vitality of this summer season you note the pastel purple blossoms in the trees the shimmering meadows and the rich healthy farmland that has been well cared for butterflies flitter from wildflower to wildflower filling the open air with beauty and wonder far into the distance way beyond the furthest trees the sun begins its descent warm orange glow is cast upon the land as the earth spins away from the sun for another day you let your entire body be bathed in its warm it doesn't take long before the spa comes into view the salt cave sanctuary is housed in a grand stone mansion built some centuries ago it is covered in whispering vines and rambling roses the gardens surrounding it are wild yet still well tendered the place is soothing inviting a wave of surrender to wash through your body and mind you make your way closer to the entrance soon arriving on the front porch before entering you take a moment to say good night to the setting sun you revel in the orange pink light that appears above the tree line and then gently you make your way inside you have arrived after regular check-in hours and so a key has been left out for you picking it up you notice that the tag reads salt sweet three and then you follow the hallway that leads to your room the dimly lit spa hallway is infused with the sweet smell of orange oil the soft candles fastened to the walls add an air of elegance while guiding you toward the room that will be yours for the coming night as you reach salt suite 3 you let yourself in with the key unveiling a beautiful softly lit bedroom and another door that leads down to your very own salt cave [Music] upon the bed is a cotton robe dropping your backpack and taking off your shoes you prepare yourself for restorative evening ahead and change into the cozy robe before you enter the door to the salt cave you notice a jug of lemon water has been placed out before you you pour yourself a small glass and then raise it to your lips feeling the properties of both water and lemon cleansing hydrating and alkalizing your body as you sip you feel yourself coming into a deeper state of balance both mentally and physically now you decide to head into the salt cave and as you open the door to enter you are faced with a set of stairs lit by the soft glow of smoldering candles you take a long deep breath in and letting it go with the sigh and then you begin your descent step by step [Music] with each step you take you feel your mind growing more relaxed and your heart growing wider your body softens too your forehead jaw and shoulders all melting towards the wooden stairs beneath your feet [Music] a warm amber glow from the bottom of the staircase entrances you sending a rippling wave of warmth and positivity through your cells and as you reach that lower level your jaw drops at the side of it the cave-like room covered in soft pink salt the walls are made of salt as is the floor beneath you as you step off that final stair it feels as if you are stepping onto a beautiful soothing beach all around you small candles are lit radiating an orange glow through salt candle holders and through the air of the room you notice that sweet smell of orange oil once again you take a long full breath in slowly letting it go as a subtle smile stretches across your face in the center of the room a cushion and blanket rest you make your way towards them and then rest your back on the soothing nourishing salt your head rests on the pillow and you lay the blanket across your body from the neck down arms rest by your sides your feet fall outwards naturally and your entire body surrenders into the salt crystals beneath you [Music] candlelight flickers against the walls and ceiling of the cave guiding you into a calm and tranquil state of being now you become more acutely aware of the music that flows through the cave sounds that work on an energetic level to cleanse both body and mind and to uplift and nourish your vibration as the sounds permeate your cells all worries all fears all limiting beliefs begin to untangle themselves falling away from your body and into the salt beneath you for transformation you feel the warmth of the coarse salt against your body it unwraps you holding you unconditionally against the earth the air you breathe is enriched with salt too rejuvenating your entire being with each breath you soften your belly and relax your shoulders even further allowing each breath to flow as deep as it comfortably reaches [Music] you imagine each breath extending out from your lungs traveling deep into any parts of you that are in need of care and nourishment focusing in on any particular area of concern whether of mind or body you direct the breath to that part of you letting each inhalation bring with it fresh regenerative positive energy and each exhalation to free you of limiting or negative thoughts the salt cave absorbs everything that no longer serves you working its alchemical magic to restore any heavy energy to its original pure state continue to breathe here to bathe in the soothing sounds of the salt cave and to sink into the crystals beneath you the candles continue to burn casting that soft orange light across the cave your own body too absorbs the healing glow as the candles flicker gently they bestow upon you an extra wave of love light and positivity you are growing tired now nearly ready to surrender to the night completely though there is a bed upstairs waiting you you long to rest where you are to sleep amidst the salt crystals and to continue absorbing their positive soothing energy as you slumber you take a moment now to make any final adjustments to your position so that you can drift away effortlessly and then you close your eyes to the salt cave slipping into the empty spaciousness within you the beautiful music continues to flow through your ears carrying you softly into sleep you drift away slowly feeling love and warmth pervading mind body and spirit you know there is nothing left for you to do but to let go to sink further and further into a deep night of peace ease and tranquility your breath and the sound vibrations carry you there until soon you find that you have arrived in the world of sweet and restorative

1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this guided before sleep meditation prepare to be taken on a journey of pure deep relaxation as you connect with your senses and engage with your inner treasures learning from your past present and future moments to experience all the benefits of this guided meditation lie down and get comfortable for a peaceful night of sleep make sure that you will not be disturbed as you settle into a position where you can lie comfortably for the duration of this recording close your eyes and prepare for a deep sense of relaxation sleep and well-being [Music] remember that this is your time a chance for you to escape from the problems of everyday life to allow the tensions of the day to dissipate and to connect with your inner self with your eyes closed breathe deeply and slowly through your nose and then slowly exhale through your mouth allowing any tension within you to disperse as the breath leaves your body [Music] now inhale again breathing in slowly through your nose to a count of four feel the air entering your lungs and extend your diaphragm as you do so enabling the air to reach into the bottom of your lungs once you've done that hold the breath for two seconds and then slowly exhale through your mouth to a count of four once more so it's breathing in for four holding for two counts and breathing out for four this is called rhythmic breathing and it will help you to absorb the techniques required to help you breathe your way through any tensions and to be able to release any worries anxieties or physical tensions each time on the out-breath I'll give you a few moments to do this [Music] now breathe normally in and out through your nose feeling the tension leaving your body as you continue to do so your arms and legs will start to feel heavier and you should feel the back of the chair or the mattress supporting your body as you let all of the tension go if you still feel areas of tension within your body deliberately tighten up those areas holding the muscle tension and then release and feel the difference as your muscles relaxed feel the tension leaving your body as it does so so tighten and release relaxing further and deeper into your meditative state [Music] you [Music] continue the cycle of breath as you imagine walking on a beautiful sandy beach the sand is shimmering under the gentle but warm rays of an early Sun there is a subtle breeze that's teasing your hair and soft against your skin the sky is a beautiful blue cloudless and stretches forever sinking only onto a distant horizon where the sea and the sky unite in a matching Azur color you feel relaxed free and look around you take in the most beautiful picture postcard scene you were sitting in a sheltered Cove with glorious cliffs reaching up into the sky providing a secure backdrop to this perfect scene the rocky cliffs glimmer gray and red with the warming intensity of the Sun and you catch glimpses of white feathers as seabird soar and dive circling on rising thermals distant bird songs filter through the air and the piercing cause of seagulls swooping high and low over the gentle waves brings back childhood memories of seaside escapades a light breeze whips across the sandy cove and the Sun burns even brighter in the sky you stand up and walk along the coastline dealing the warm sand on the soles of your feet and through your toes frothy waves wash up onto the beach and in the distance white sailing boats drift by the feeling is one of peace as you walk along the golden sands you see up ahead what seems like a gentle homeless man with a small dog walking on the edge of the lapping waters he's looking up to the sky muttering to himself and calling out to the seagulls clothed in tattered pants and a white baggy shirt with an overgrown beard carrying two bags of what looks like clothes and blankets he approaches you in turns and speaks directly to you your treasure chest is near in a deep cavern his voice trails off as he passes you however a breeze picks up and you hear his final words riches beyond belief you turn to see him once more however as you do this he and his dog are nowhere to be seen you sit for a moment on the sandy beach to collect your thoughts wondering what that was all about his words echo inside your head your treasure chest is near riches beyond belief getting up from the sand you are drawn to a cliff face opposite the beach that appears to have a cave carved within it out of curiosity you begin to move towards it clambering carefully over small rocks strewn out into their ever reaching tides you wander through small rock pools feeling the coolness of the water on your feet the beach cave looks welcoming and as you approach the rocks have been smoothed as if by hand and you reach out and trail your fingers against the entrance to the cavern walls there is a coolness in places and in others the rocks are warm to the touch where the Sun touches them as you take in the scene in front of you and move forward you see dappling light around the walls of the cave mesmerizing welcoming and intriguing the temperature within the entrance dips immediately but it isn't cold it feels nice to be out of the sunlight for a while marvel at the contours of the beach cave in front of you pockets of stone walkways smooth walls with a contrast of light and dark as small gaps in the rock face allow the Sun to penetrate the darkened depths the beach cave has a strange almost spiritual feel to it peaceful and tranquil and yet it feels as if it has had a purpose not simply carved by the elements but by loving hands smoothing the stone into submission the sound of water can be heard echoing from deeper into the cave although the tide is gently lapping along the rocks leading to the cave entrance inside the low rocks are dry so no danger from an encroaching tide the temperature changes as you move deeper into the labyrinth of cavernous rooms a carved archway lies ahead of you and the cave room within flickers and sparkles with flecks of green as you move into the deeper part of the cavern you hear the words once more vibrating throughout the cave your treasure is near in a cavern riches beyond belief you're drawn to move forward and enter a space so soothing and peaceful that you feel any remaining tension dissipate to your right deeper within the cave you see what looks to be a dusty old ornate chest moving to this large old crate curious to see what this is you blow the dust and sand away it reveals to you what looks to be an ancient old treasure chest could this be the treasure chest the homeless man on the beach was referring to treasure nearby you sit in front of it get comfortable and loosen the already unlocked latches the chest opens it glistens with gold you see that is divided into three sections they're marked past present and future and in each section a small tin boxes [Music] you glanced into the section of the chest marked past and see a little green emerald encrusted tin taking this out easing the lid off slowly you see two folded pieces of paper you unfold the first piece gently and it has printed in beautiful handwritten calligraphy the words let go take a moment to meditate on this what is this telling you is this something from the past that you need to release and let go of perhaps an old relationship a habit that no longer serves you for you or your highest good just take these next few moments to let go and find peace in the release of old and worn-out patterns [Music] you decide to read the next piece of paper you gently unfold it and it says the word forgive you think about this for a moment have you been harboring some distaste for someone or something that has happened to you in your past possibly someone who has mistreated you or maybe you need to forgive yourself and let go of guilt that you have been beating yourself up over for a long time just spend the next few moments contemplating forgiveness and release any pain you've held on to this long enough set yourself free [Music] you place both of these papers back into the emerald tin putting it gently back into the chest where you found it as you do this you feel a cool breeze blow gently throughout the cavern as if clearing away any final thoughts on letting go and forgiveness you reach back into the chest and take out a ruby encrusted tin that has been marked with the word present excited to open this you peel back the old tin lid to reveal a piece of paper that says meditate on three things you are grateful for today give thanks for what you currently have in your life take a moment think this through are you living with a roof over your head do you have food to eat maybe you have great friends family or even a loving pet think of three things you are grateful for in this moment and give thanks true thanks to your higher power within when we are grateful for all we have more of what we want will show up in our lives meditate on these words in the next few moments what am i grateful for [Music] you place the folded paper back into the ruby encrusted tin placing it back in the treasure chest before you you reach in and take up the last small box this one is diamund and crusted it glistens even within the dark cavern itself it has the words future carved in black on the top of the lid you are excited to open this one to see what it holds for you and you open it and notice three pieces of paper within you grab the first one out and slowly unravel it the words my career seemed to appear as if by magic on this paper you give this some thought what is it you truly want to do for your working life what would you want to do if you didn't have to be answerable to anyone envision this take a few moments to see what you are doing what are other people doing or saying that tells you that you have achieved this dream possibly you already have your dream job but want to take a moment to give gratitude be with this for the next few moments see it feel it be it [Music] you place this little piece of paper back in the diamond tin and reach in to grab the other piece of paper opening it up slowly the words relationships and love are written what does this mean for you is there something or someone you would like to attract into your life could there be a way that you could better serve a relationship that you are currently in whether that be a friendship partner or family relationship possibly it's all about a better relationship with yourself loving and accepting yourself more dig deep in the next few moments and see this relationship expand and grow into something beautiful [Music] [Music] finally you place this back into the tin and reach in to pull out the final piece of paper this one says the word health [Music] you give this one some thought are you happy with your current health of your body mind and spirit is there something you could do to help improve your life it will possibly eat less exercise more meditate more to give yourself peace of mind just take the next few moments to meditate and sit with this listen out for any directions visions or phrases that may come to your mind to help give you some clarity in this area of health [Music] you place this little tin back in the chest and just before you close it a breeze tunnels its way through the cavern once more clearing the way for all that you have discovered to take place in your life you sit for a moment in gratitude grateful for the homeless man who guided you here and happy that you have listened to your intuition you leave this treasure chest knowing that it will be here should you wish to come back to it sometime in the near future you begin to make your way towards the entrance of the cave and once more you sit for a moment into a stone carved seat at its entrance take a moment to breathe in deeply and then release deliberately letting go of any tension within your muscles deeply relax all of your muscles feel as each muscle begins to relax let go and if your body wants to sleep allow it to fall asleep the water sounds from the beach almost musical in its consistency from your vantage point you become mesmerised by the beautiful dappled green colors that dab the cave roof or zipped with an artist's brush consider how you feel this moment in time our peaceful how wonderful it feels to be cocooned within this natural place with such peaceful vibrations tell yourself that you are at peace here you are at one with nature remind yourself that life is for living for experiencing for discarding old wounds and for embracing all that lies ahead take a deep breath in through your nose and then breathe out slowly feeling your body relaxed yet further into the stone carved seat relax your body's still further feel your body unwinding the muscles growing heavy total relaxation enveloping you continue to be aware of the breath and use it to channel relaxation throughout your body [Music] [Music] [Music] the warmth from the Sun cocooned your body and brings you back to the present gently breathe in again deeply and then exhale ensuring that no areas of tension exist within you enjoy the feeling of warmth on your skin and the powder blue skies above like a giant canopy stretching across the open cliff expanse you are centered you retain the feeling of peace and wonder enjoy the moment and the feeling of harmony as you sit on the sand and enjoy the last few moments of this meditation before you drift off into a deep slumber enjoy the Sun warm against your skin and the gentle breeze playing with your hair breathe in and then out allowing yourself to drift off deeper and deeper into a deeply relaxed state remember that you can revisit this treasure chest cave of spiritual tranquility at any time you need by simply closing your eyes and allowing the sensations to wash over and embrace you sleep may be coming now the treasure chest awaits your next visit with riches beyond belief [Music] [Music]

yourself if you need to relax fully breathing deeply again and fully exhale and repeat inhale slowly and fully exhale on the breath out let any tension dissipate just let it all go [Music] now it's easy for your mind to wander during a meditation session but don't let that worry you this is natural this is a part of the meditation process and you will soon gain control over your mind just gently and firmly bring it back if your thoughts start to race acknowledge the thought and then bring it back again to your breathing it's all a part of the learning process and you will still gain all the benefits of this meditation session so if you're ready let's begin visualize yourself now transported to the steps leading up to an old bridge made from stone weathered from time and from an assault by the elements there are steps curving upwards with cast iron railings swirling alongside affording magnificent views across the deep tranquil waters surrounded by a mass of greenery the breeze is soft against your skin warm but soothing visualize yourself moving up the steps each step is worn and uneven but they are shallow you find them easy to climb trail your fingers across the top of the railings and feel the iron warm beneath your fingertips at the final step turn and look across the expanse of water it is afternoon and the Sun has started its gradual descent across the sky and as the light changes the trees surrounding the water glow and the colors change for perhaps the first time you become in tune with nature you become aware of the depth of color that exists as clouds scurry across the blue expanse of sky notice how the light shifts and the sun's rays muted send rays of gold across the tranquil waters flecks of light dance on the tips of slow-moving water cresting in places this place exudes serenity you feel calm you feel relaxed you feel peaceful inhale deeply drawing fresh pure oxygen deeply into your lungs exhale fully feeling your lungs deflate as you do so and repeat this intake of breath feeling air inflating your lungs once more and as you breathe out let go of any negative feelings or tension that you may be harboring in your body just let it all go turn your attention back to the scene in front of you and notice the power of blue sky as if dabbed on creatively and mixed with cotton wool white to form the clouds a screen of green adorns the edges of blue the breeze sends leaves whirling up into the air along with the blossom you watch it as it cascades even higher at the mercy of the air current and gradually released dropping towards the surface of the water where once lazy fish rise to the surface to investigate as you stand here and observe you realize that you are an integral part of this scene there is a sense of oneness yet you have not been here before it is as if something has been missing in life previously and now there is a sense of wonder as to what is to come ask yourself who are you deep within what do you need what are you searching for just allow these questions to resonate within you you feel a deeply wonderful connection with nature more than you have thought was possible you feel mesmerised by the sun's rays as they penetrate the foliage casting an almost autumn glow as clouds scurry past the Sun the light changes again and this time the leaves are shimmering gold and yellow these trees are different they Bend and sway teased by the breeze it is as if you are standing on the threshold of two worlds it is as if you're looking back over the past and all that could have been when you turn and look in the other direction your perspective shifts and you are filled with positive energy life is fleeting every second merges with the next and clock hands continue to move never pausing each passing moment striding fords to greet the next and such is life with each season that blends effortlessly the world continues to turn this place feels almost spiritual and it feels as if the missing piece of the puzzle revealing the secrets of the universe as clicked into place this is a place where the past the present and the future merge here life is almost timeless you have time to think to feel and to embrace the positive energy that is here you can contemplate and carve out a route towards happiness in life there are many lessons to be learned as we can learn much through letting go of tension and of deeply relaxing calming the mind only then in your mind perceive all that is possible so relax breathing in and breathing out be at peace with yourself find contentment in this moment as the birds above perform well choreographed flight across the sky effectively using the air currents to lift and twist and turn and butterflies flutter delicately their reflections mirrored in the water below you know that you have never been so at peace with nature you yearn for the freedom to fly and understand that to be free we sometimes have to make changes in life fragrance fills the air as plants lift their faces up to the Sun as you breathe in this delicate fragrance clears any muddled thoughts away and soothes your soul turning now you see a narrow trail leading off into the woodland space and tempted begin to move towards it feeling each step down as you leave the bridge this trail undulates throughout fresh young saplings and shrubs all the eyeing for their place in the sunlight you follow a small Inlet of water that meanders across the narrow trail alongside your chosen pathway it is cooler here with some of the taller trees blocking sunlight with only glimpses of gold penetrating those taller trees and the Rays and you bathe in natural light replenishing your aura you watch as the leaves fall you see each one with a shimmering energy as the leaf spirals around and dances on the breeze this brings an instant sense of reflection into your mind what do you need to let go of in life what changes are necessary to help you grow and develop as a person and to reach your full potential which part of your life needs more focus do you long for love perhaps you need a career satisfaction each one of us needs to find our own pathway through life so that we can reach our true potential and feel great happiness all around you is the purest energy of life which can be utilized at any time you need life love and happiness is here in abundance reach out and draw it to you you are empowered you are in control of your life [Music] insects dart and hover seemingly oblivious to your presence or simply accepting you are a part of this natural scene you feel so peaceful and so relaxed as the bird saw even higher consider the heights at which that inner you can soar to if you let go of the stresses and strains of life do you feel shackled to the past isn't it time to break free and to explore all there is to offer visualize now the chains of life breaking free and breathe in deeply inhaling the purest joy that freedom offers and exhale slowly casting all doubts to one side mentally repeat these words to yourself I allow instinct to guide me I embrace freedom of choice I welcome the opportunity to make life changes I fully embrace my abundant life the sound of water nearby is soothing your eyes feel heavy asleep gently nudges you follow a new pathway taking you to the water's edge where dark and light depths greet you this pathway resonates with you it shows you that life is a series of choices walk the road less traveled and you may be rewarded with experiences and successes you have not thought possible there is an abundance of natural energy light shade love and contentment you only have to let it into your life the Sun shimmers and teases the shallow depth sprinkling light on the surface the contrast is spectacular all around you is nature at its best the energy of the place reverberates deep within you it is a perfect place for relaxation it is as if nature has sculpted a semicircle of trees plants and flowers and there is an abundance of vibrant color and fragrances the tree nearest to the water's edge branches out over the water and one large gnarled old branch reaches inland and across the grassy area beneath your feet tied to the branch a perfect seat for you to relax in so to forge a stronger connection with this tranquil scene you clamber onto this world crafted swing seat which is adorned with deep cushions for support it fits you perfectly and feels so comfortable you feel weightless and as the breeze increases the seat starts to swing gently back and forth you hold on to the strong chords holding the seat and cast your eyes across the river catching a glimpse of the bridge mainly hidden from view by the trees growing alongside the riverbank this is perfection let sleep claim you your eyes are becoming heavier yet your body feels weightless tension dissipates with every intake of breath you feel peaceful you are relaxed you are sleepy [Music] feel the sensation of the supportive cushions soft beneath you and let yourself drift away this is the perfect place for sleep you are a part of nature there is nothing to disturb you in this place you are safe you are peaceful you are an integral part of the universe and as you breathe in and out you replenish your mind body and soul with healing energy and life-giving oxygen with each breath out relax even further releasing any negative thoughts or feelings let them go breathing in positive energy and on your exhale release old worn out negative patterns blow them away allow the light of potential for your future to shine brightly think of it as a star that leads the way towards successes and whatever your heart desires as you feel yourself slowly falling asleep know that your subconscious mind will work on solving any of life's questions or problems while you sleep deeply it's time to let go of anxiety of unresolved traumas or outstanding issues nothing matters at this moment but to simply be this is your place you can return here at any time you need all you need to do is close your eyes focus on your breathing and transport yourself back to the bridge as if the entry point to this tranquil setting here there is only positive energy visit at night or during the day visit whenever you need to each time you come here your senses will be awash with the wonders of positive energy and well-being each time you'll be greeted with new science and new sensations every experience every sensation promotes your personal positive energy within this place you open your perception the gentle swaying of the trees highlights your need to be flexible in life the falling of leaves highlights you'll need to let go of some elements that hold you back in your own life the bird soaring overhead I like your need to be free and to reach your full potential the gentle sound of water as it passes on reminds you of your need to be flexible in life and to go with the flow now it's time to let go of muddled thoughts and self doubts you see life clearly the universe and the natural wonders of the world provides you with energy to inspire to encourage and to see the best route through life for you here there is an abundance of positivity you have it all everything you need to carve out the life you have always wanted let's leap claim you now your eyes are getting heavier [Music] that all thoughts dissipate yeah there are no thoughts or feelings beyond the sensation of peace let yourself drift away sleep deeply you will wake up when your mind and body is fully replenished but until then allow the tranquil setting the gentle movement of your comfortable swing seat and the sounds of nature to lull you into a contented and peaceful state inhale deeply and exhale fully drift away if you want to end this meditation now simply stretch out and open your eyes however if you want to continue just allow the sounds of nature to take you away [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
1 [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] welcome to your the magic walk guided meditation for anxiety relief close your eyes and imagine every fiber of your body relaxing as if a great weight has been taken off your entire body allow your chest and belly to inflate filling with the air around you notice the way you were holding your eyes your shoulders your feet if you feel any tension or worry imagine it melting just like butter in the Sun breathe deeply and relax in your mind's eye and vision yourself standing up and approaching the wall nearest you as you get closer to it you notice a door appearing let yourself be drawn to this door and when you reach it open it [Applause] pass through to the staircase beyond where you sense the warm beckoning presence of a familiar place ascend the stairs feeling yourself grow more and more relaxed as you reach the top you are in a library a place you may have been before ahead of you Liars a comfortable looking chair with a small sandy colored book lying on the cushion let yourself sink into the chair and pick up the book as you open the cover and begin to read you notice the type growing larger filling your vision completely almost as soon as it begins it dissolves away leaving you in a totally new and different place you are sitting on a warm stone wall above you is the electric-blue of a summer sky and surrounding you are wildflowers growing out of the sandy soil breathe in the scent of these blooms and listen to the gentle rustle of their leaves in the slightest of breezes this place is safe and comforting a stone wall you are seated on radiates the sun's warmth filling your body with a heady sense of power feel the way the heat from the rock and the sky above you touches your skin warming you to the core you realize that just as the rock holds the sun's rays you hold and radiate your own incredible power even on cloudy days the Sun is still there and even when you feel weak or powerless your strength and unbreakable will are there as well next to you on the wall is a simply made pottery jug and a glass bottle with a cork the bottle is empty but the jug is full of an inky black liquid at the very core of your being you realize that this black substance represents your fears and anxieties stored deep inside your subconscious mind it is normal to carry fear with you sometimes however our busy lives do not leave us time to address these anxieties and they can fill up this jug inside your mind when you feel anxious it is simply your mind asking you to spend a moment or two relaxing and tending to this need this is what this time is for as we move through this meditation you will have the opportunity to cleanse yourself of all anxiousness and stress that you carry with you right now pick up the jug feeling the underlying complexity of its earthenware construction to not be afraid of this vessel nothing it contains is harmful you are entirely safe as you peer over the lip of this jug and look into your reflection in the black liquid as you hold the jug you feel the warmth from your hands and the Sun warming it and you realize that you are about to recognize the sources of your fears at a deep level of understanding and forgiveness so take a moment to watch your reflection begin to shift forming itself into whatever picture you need to see to understand your anxiety perhaps more than one scene will appear either way smile gently and say thank you to each picture you encounter expressing gratitude for its work and message in your life [Music] [Music] as the scenes in the jug dissolve back into the liquid allow yourself to pick up the glass bottle next to you remove the cork and pour the contents of the jug into it knowing that you cannot spill the black liquid now that you have communicated with it once every last drop of the liquid has left the jug carefully replace the bottle stopper and stand up you take a few steps forward and see that you have been sitting on the rock wall overlooking a very deep valley in your heart you know that no one has ever seen this valley except for you and that it is a perfect reflection of your own innate power take a moment to reflect on what you see below and understand that it is a geological expression of you and your unbreakable will you need not be afraid anymore [Music] with this euphoric realization feel the weight of the glass bottle in your hand raise your arm over your head and giving one last thank you to the liquid inside the glass throw it as hard as you can into the valley below you see the glass bottle shatter far below you the inky black liquid spilling out across the ground yet before your eyes it begins to evaporate turning into a silver shimmery mist at the base of the cliff you hear faint strains of song out of the Mist emerge thousands of birds their feathers all the cars of the rainbow they fly up and into the sky above you swirling and dipping in an aerial dance of pure delight watch their patterns as they move across the sky and allow yourself to realize that you yourself have transformed your fear and anxiety into this beautiful spectacle before your eyes listen to the birds jubilant song and watch the way they colored bodies flutter across the electric blue sky you have created this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the birds make a huge lap through the valley a farewell signal to you and dispersed far into the distance you smile wishing them the best of luck in everything they do as you do this you sense something behind you and when you turn around you realize it is the book from the library before your eyes it opens and the familiar sight of printed letters floods your vision lifting you from the warmth of the stone cliff the letters rush faster and faster then dissolve leaving you sitting back in the library the book resting on your lap allow yourself to rise and return to the staircase passing shelf after shelf of familiar books approach the staircase and begin your descent allowing the library to grow smaller behind you as you come closer and closer to consciousness as you approach the door below you you feel the same sense of power you felt by the stone war rushed through your veins you've contained the strength of character to change anything you encounter allow yourself to hold this sense of confidence and purpose with you as you approach the place you began this meditation you have returned from this meditation a changed person and so begin to wiggle your fingers and toes gently wake up the parts of you that have rested why you are on your journey when you are ready let your eyes open and smile at the world around you you are powerful enough to transform fear into beauty now allow this ever-present strength to guide you through the rest of your day or evening [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you

whatever the case you've arrived at the right place and this meditation is for you so without further ado let's relax the mind and firstly I want to drop the word and I want you to drop the word meditation there is so much associated with meditation what it is meant to do and what we must achieve from meditation so let's drop everything associated with achieving anything and let's just simply call this a before sleep journey so right now we want to let go of all expectations and set out to achieve nothing just to simply be if we can just be we are on the path to peace of mind accepting all that is in this given moment so getting comfortable now wriggling around if necessary arms by your side feet relaxed and just let your feet part naturally as they choose to begin by closing your eyes and gently taking three deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth and on the breath in sending that breath all the way down to your lower belly area and feeling this area expand and as you breathe out feeling it deflate like a balloon that's releasing air [Music] and once you've done this returning your breath to a natural and comfortable rhythm breathing in and out through your nose [Music] now during this journey we're about to embark on together thoughts are going to come and go in fact you're going to go off on tangents into your own world and at times not even realizing that you've drifted off and away from this sleep journey this is perfectly okay so when you become aware of this just welcome your awareness back saying to yourself ah Here I am again back on my journey so no matter how many times you have to do this it's perfectly okay and normal to have thoughts coming and going so right now just become aware of your body the weight of it the feeling of your head on the pillow or the mattress and feel yourself as you begin to get heavier as though you are sinking through the mattress with each breath feel this heaviness sweep across your body from your core Center out to the extremes of your body your toes your fingers the top of your head feel this getting heavier and heavier [Music] if you sense any worries or concerns at this moment you can let them go now you are safe in this moment right where you belong in perfect timing [Music] as you feel yourself sinking I would like you to visualize that you are sinking through to a soft Bank of white fluffy clouds now you may see these white clouds you may feel them or just simply sense that they are there surrounding you comforting you [Music] you may have had a busy day today with a hectic schedule but right now give yourself permission to let this go even if only for the next few minutes allow any stress and tension in your body to melt away to dissolve and the clouds are here to help you as they wrap you within their softness protecting you nurturing you [Music] [Music] within this time and space you have the opportunity to let go of your worries and fears and take some time to simply be [Music] so embrace this chance to be without thinking and instead focus your mind on the warmth and drowsiness it's filling your limbs allow yourself to move softly and intuitively through this journey allowing the physical sensations around you to be your focus instead of thoughts or worries if you find thoughts surface blow them out on your next breath let them go [Music] breathing deeply [Music] you are continuing to drift downwards sinking through the clouds softly safely moving closer and closer to a glowing white light shining brightly comforting you as you get closer to it

be absorbed into the gentle warmth that emits when the warmth enters your body flowing through your veins and even easing any aches and pains you may be experiencing you drift deeper into this velvety bed of fluffy white clouds feel the softness of the clouds around you the clouds are warm and comforting delicately reaching out to embrace you your head drifts into the airy whiteness surrounding you

sensations that come with it be all the soft heat of the Sun on your face now and your eyelids as they drift shut continue to breathe deeply inhaling the gentle sunlight and exhaling any stress or tension from your day just enjoy these next few moments floating effortlessly on your own in your save space [Music] [Music] [Music] focusing on your breath brings you to an even deeper sense of calm and relaxation in fact as you breathe deeper and deeper closer to the bottom of your lungs you begin to notice any lingering thoughts and worries as brightly colored balloons surrounding your pillowy resting place these concerns take shape as you watch them moving through the same sky as you the thoughts above you drift back and forth attached to you with thin almost invisible strings although these thought balloons are fascinating to watch move across the sky above you they hold you aloft when all you want to do is to continue to sink further into the welcoming bed of clouds around you so take a moment to look at these thoughts above you enjoying their colors say thank you for their presence with you today as you examine and thank your thoughts imagine now cutting all the thin threads binding them to you [Music] watch these thought balloons drift upwards their strings dancing as they rise into the air above you watch them until the small colourful shapes disappear from view [Music] [Music] know that these buoyant thoughts are gone leaving you free to sink further and further into the soft whiteness around you just breathe deeply now and notice how your body feels if you notice thoughts or concerns appearing in your mind's eye simply thank them for all their work today and cut them loose watching them float away far from view this place is for noticing the sensations in your body and savoring the relaxation that comes with it allow yourself to take a deep breath and enjoy it all allow yourself to keep drifting downwards feel the way the clouds touch brushes pain or aches

1 hello there my name is jason stevenson and welcome to tonight's guided meditation to help calm the mind and release anxious thoughts in tonight's meditation i'll provide you with guidance to witness anxious thought streams to surrender to them and to return to your inner peace whoever you are no matter what you are experiencing you are welcome here we will move through this process slowly and gently and you'll be given plenty of time to shift and soften any anxiety that is present for you during this practice you are encouraged to drift off to sleep whenever slumber comes naturally for you so we will begin by taking a few moments to settle in through breath and body awareness and then i will guide you to a comfortable place in the middle of a tranquil forest an environment that will further help you to let go and so before we begin take a moment to find a comfortable laying down position that will be supportive of deep sleep when the time comes just allow your spine to lengthen and your limbs to soften as you feel into how gravity is holding you here right now closing your eyes whenever you feel ready and take a moment to check in with your physical body just inquire with your body about whether you might need anything else in this moment perhaps a pillow a blanket a pair of socks or any other adjustment and when you're ready find a comfortable position of relative stillness you don't need to aim for complete stillness as your body is always in subtle motion anyways but see if you can surrender as much as you can into non-doing knowing that you are always free to make adjustments as you need to throughout the practice and turn your attention towards the breath for a few moments now just minding its natural rhythm as it moves through your body and for the next few breath cycles refrain from changing the breath in any way simply allow it to flow naturally while also considering the fact that each full breath cleanses and nourishes and supports you each breath in restores your blood of the oxygen it requires and each breath out emits what no longer serve you and now i invite you to take three deep breaths at your own pace beginning whenever you are ready and inhaling to the furthest depth that is still comfortable for you and then exhale maybe releasing a soft sigh or anything else that yearns to be let go of inhale completely and exhale what you no longer need after your third deep breath just continue to breathe naturally and then take a moment to re-ground into the surface supporting you and just take note of each part of your body that is in contact with your bed and noting the sensation of fabric against your skin and before we move into the forest inside your mind just take a moment to offer a word of gratitude for the place that holds you right now make a note of any aspects of your environment that you can be thankful for in this very moment and when you're finished turn towards the creative center within your own mind and through your mind i invite you to travel consciously now finding yourself in a brilliant forest held beneath the warm late summer sun you were standing on a narrow footpath of aromatic amber soil and on either side of you majestic trees stretch up towards the beaming cosmos the wind is warm as it brushes just gently against your cheeks standing here in the wilderness of these woods your shoulders begin to soften and drop this forest sanctuary comes to you as a refuge away from the weight of the world from all that you felt you needed to carry in the days up until now for these precious moments i invite you to grant yourself permission to let go to simply tune into what is right here and to open up to the possibility of deep release and inner peace as you grant yourself this permission you know that you don't need to force yourself to feel any different than you do right now and furthermore know that opening up to inner peace does not mean that all of your outer world challenges will disappear however consider that there is a chance of finding respite beneath the waves of the worried mind know only that this peace and tranquility is possible opening your heart to the journey that guide you there now take a moment to feel into your body here in the forest as you witness yourself acclimatizing to your new environment perhaps you might see yourself stretch your arms up towards the sky or reaching down to the earth in reverence witness yourself moving in any way that helps to free up and release stagnant or anxious energy within your body eventually you returned to standing gazing down the trail stretched out before you the path ahead is whimsical weaving in and out of the old growth forest you take a long deep breath inhaling the forest air and as you exhale you begin on your way taking the trail mindful step by step as you go you absorb the beauty of the forest around you hummingbirds flitter through the air and squirrels and chipmunks jump from treetop to treetop ancient ferns rise up from the earth in their cosmic patterns and countless other species of plants and animals make themselves known to you in fact the diversity is beyond anything you've ever seen take a moment to explore the environment for yourself as you walk through it allow it to come to life with any plants animals or even insects that bring you a sense of peace and well-being consider the fact that your inner forest is completely unique to your own mind and imagination and bring it to life in any way that soothes you in other words plant your inner refuge as you please as you witness the peace that lives in this forest notice how a sense of ease grows inside of you notice your belly softening your limbs relaxing and your worried or controlling mind letting go even further breath by breath by breath simply just being in this forest provides you with something you it helps you to naturally and effortlessly begin the process of letting go now soften your gaze on the plants and animals of this forest as you focus once again on the trail ahead of you as you do you notice that this pathway ends just a few meters up ahead and where it does there is a small clearing in the woods you make your way towards the clearing which enchants your heart and mind completely it's surrounded by tall ancient trees with wild flowers lining the perimeter teal violet and fuchsia petals are in full bloom the soil in the clearing is bare but it's still rich and full of invisible energy and in the center of it a tiny nest of sorts has been laid out for you a persian rug is spread across the solid earth and on top of it plush cushions and blankets are scattered this human-like nest in the middle of the forest has your name on it and so you make yourself cozy within it as you come to rest your back on the soft rug in the middle of the forest wriggling your body to get comfortable you take a few deep breaths to settle in and softening your belly as you breathe with each breath in you embrace the vitality of the forest around you and with each outward breath you feel yourself melting a little bit further into the earth each breath brings you back to what is right here back to the peace that is possible when you connect with what is present you continue to breathe naturally as you gaze out at the world from the surface of the earth those majestic trees stand even taller with canopies that dance through the glistening sun the trees are alive you can feel their energy and you embrace their shelter their stability and their protection now gazing up at the canopy you see that there is enough open space for the sunlight to pour through as it does it blesses your entire body not only does it offer you its warmth it offers ease and release as well to further soothe the mind you tune in more closely to the physical body as it rests beneath this glorious sun you begin by drawing your attention towards your crown feeling the golden light of this radiant star penetrating opening and softening the uppermost part of you this light begins to seep downwards relaxing all the muscles around your eyes it disarms the flow of any repetitive and unhelpful thought patterns you exhale to release surrendering your mind to the cleansing power of this light and then you feel the sun's rays inch further down filling and relaxing your jaw your tongue and your throat you take a long deep breath into this golden light feeling it ease any tension you've been carrying in and around this part of you still resting on the forest floor you feel into the sun's light as it enters your shoulders and then as it slowly seeps into your upper arms your elbows and lower arms and into your hands as this metallic yellow light fills you from shoulders to fingertips you feel your arms let go you feel them surrender you know that there is nothing you need to latch onto nothing you need to fix to grasp or to sort out you just grant your arms permission to surrender the light from your shoulders now enters into your upper torso your lower back melts it surrenders and your heart space opens up to the universal light that touches it as you breathe life force moves into and out of your heart with complete ease and then the golden light seeps even further downwards tracing the length of your spine until it lands in the center of your belly as you breathe here feel your belly filling with radiant sunlight it dissolves all tension all contraction and all worry helping you to breathe a little deeper at the same time your lower back begins to soften as well coming into deeper and deeper peace here in the forest where you rest you witness as the sun's glow enters your pelvic region now and as it does your hips begin to unknot tension begins to melt seeping into the earth beneath you for renewal and finally the golden light of the sun begins to inch its way down your legs first it fills your upper legs relaxing all of these muscles completely then it flows down to your knees into your calves and shins and eventually into your feet into each and every toe feel both of your legs surrendering with the support of the light shining down from above you waves of calm pulse through your entire body follow them for a moment now witnessing them as currents of golden light ebbing and flowing from the top of your head to your toes and then from your toes to the top of your head and back again as this golden wave of calm rises up to your crown it eases your mind and connects you to everything around you and as it ebbs back towards your feet it grounds you deep into the earth providing you with a sense of strength and resilience the sun's rays continue to hold you as you tune into other elements of the forest now first you notice the sweet aroma that fills your nostrils as you breathe you absorb the aliveness of the forest with each full breath then your eyes trace the lengths of those remarkable trees which are firmly rooted calm and stable you admire the base of the trees and the intricate pattern of their bark and then your gaze rises up them noticing the complexity of branches that extend out from the solid stable core the leaves on those upper branches are diverse and varied even from down below you can see that some are round some are triangular and some are irregular like the leaves of the chestnut trees and the maples just together they dance seamlessly in the soft breeze occasionally you witness a leaf splitting from its branch and dancing down towards the earth you admire how effortlessly it lets go how naturally it surrenders as you gaze up at the leaves you realize how transient they are seasons come and seasons go and throughout the seasons the trees shed their leaves in order to be renewed and so you liken the leaves above you to the thoughts that come and go for seasons in your mind anxious or worried thoughts are just as transient as those delicate leaves that shimmer in the wind and so as you rest here beneath the canopy pair each falling leaf with an anxious ruminating or worried thought that you would like to release or soften as one of these thoughts come to mind see it falling towards the rich and fertile earth as a delicate leaf does at the end of its season as each leaf of anxiety or worry falls towards the earth something remarkable happens time appears to speed up in your mind's eye as you watch each fallen leaf transmute from vibrant green to deep red to dark rust and quickly as if you were watching time-lapsed film you observe each leaf decay becoming one with the bed of soil it rests on continue to watch this miraculous process of transformation on your own link each anxious thought with a falling leaf and as it arrives on the earth watch as alchemy takes over what begins as a worried delicate leaf fluttering in the wind of life is capable of transforming of becoming rich dense soil through the ever-present possibility of transformation remember that your body is a tool to facilitate release with each thought that surrenders to the earth allow the body to surrender as well by relaxing your body you encourage the mind to do the same any and all sorts of anxious thoughts can be processed in this way so long as the cause of your concern does not require urgent action in this moment it's possible to tap into a sense of surrender and to let go of anxious thoughts does not mean we don't care about certain outcomes or that we are in denial of how we feel rather it's a simple recognition that the past cannot be returned to that the future is undetermined and that all we have is the present moment and in this present moment we can choose to open ourselves up to deeper peace you continue to rest on the forest floor bundled up as the sun moves behind the canopy now the air is still warm and so you are completely comfortable take a few more moments of silence to watch leaves of anxious thoughts fall towards the earth watch them quickly and effortlessly turn into dried leaves and then into soil itself your eyes are growing tired but you continue to absorb the tranquility of the world around you here amongst the plants insects and trees you realize that anxiety is not a concern the various beings that call this forest home simply go about their lives they know what needs to be done and they do it and the rest they leave an awareness grows within you that nature doesn't need to worry yes there are times when it must leap into action to protect itself but it doesn't over ruminate it doesn't overthink this recognition alone helps you to breathe deeper helps you to further surrender you come back to your breathing feeling the natural rhythm of this cycle moving through you just like the seasons the breath comes and it goes it comes and it goes you feel yourself surrendering deeper to this universal wisdom of the breath you realize that there is indeed an innate universal force that is holding you and supporting you you realize now that you do not need to do nor do you accomplish everything on your own and so if you'd like to i invite you now to ask the universal energy all around you for any support that you need for a final release in other words is there something that you are still struggling to let go of something that you need support with and if so turn towards the sky that seeps through the canopy overhead and ask for its wisdom for its support if you hear a wise voice offer its support to you know that not only does it come from the universe around you it comes simultaneously from inside your very own being you are the holder of the wisdom that you seek for a few more silent moments come back to the falling leaves let any thoughts that do not serve you be surrendered now allow the universe and your inherent wisdom to support you with this if it feels natural for you you might even tap into a sense of joy as you observe the falling leaves letting go doesn't always have to be difficult often there is joy in release now you can tell by the movement of shadows that the sun is beginning its final departure the forest appears to be preparing for a good night's rest animals have slowed their stirring butterflies have retreated for the night and all that remains in their place is near stillness as the earth slows down so do you the mind which had already experienced a sense of quiet tranquility slows even further you are beginning to pass into the state between wakefulness and sleep but before you drift off completely you continue to take in the radiance of the world around you namely the colors in this evening sky first the sky illuminates with a soft clementine orange glow it doesn't quite reach the uppermost cosmos but the horizon casts its light through the surrounding trees this radiant orange light floats across your body granting you warmth and balance and vitality from head to toe you open yourself up to it completely soon the orange light in the sky begins to transmute electric magenta begins to shine through in its place as it covers your body it grants you a sense of childlike wonder magic and trust open your heart to this enchanting pink glow the light in the sky continues to shift soon the once pink glow becomes a deep mesmerizing violet a color associated with wisdom spiritual connection and the soothing of emotions you feel yourself coming into complete alignment as this violet light passes over you all of your cells all of your muscles your nerve endings and all of your organs are touched by this cleansing radiant light it fills your entire body from the tips of your toes to the crown of your head and as it fills your mind space it dispels any last ruminating thought patterns that may have been stubbornly holding on you don't need to bring them with you into the slumber ahead the dark violet color grows deeper soon becoming a midnight blue you can still make out the night sky against the black silhouette of trees overhead and through that empty space that exposes you to the cosmos the milky way begins to appear the thick blanket of stars is mesmerizing you feel completely safe and supported here in the forest somehow as the day has departed and the midnight hour creeps closer you have gained an embodied sense of belonging you feel a part of this forest a part of this entire earth and universe in fact and it is this deep sense of belonging that awakens your inner peace worried thoughts may still rise from time to time but you've gained a new perspective of them ear gazing out at the milky way you realize that in fact you are not looking out at the stars you are a part of them and being a part of the universe like this you are unconditionally supported through everything you are unconditionally loved sink into this deeper understanding of your belonging for a few long deep breaths if you'd like to you might want to release a soft sigh with each exhalation if any worries or anxious thoughts creep back know that you hold the power to release and to soften them just refrain from judging these thoughts or pushing them away simply acknowledge them as a part of yourself that simply needs your love and compassion grant them your love let them know how strong you are and then allow these unhelpful thoughts just to fade away through the canopy above you catch side of the moon making itself known to the dark sky tonight it is a waning crescent moon fading into darkness day by day by day this waning moon offers a final reminder to surrender it invites you to make space by cleansing the old so that you may set new intentions and new belief systems to empower you in the days to come so as you gaze up at the radiant silver of the moon take a moment to consider what intention you'd like to set for the day that awaits you what qualities or ways of being would you like to harness while you sleep and carry into tomorrow once you have your intention silently repeat it to the moon three times release your words of intention when you've finished your third repetition and sinking back into the silent stillness of the evening forest feel back into your breath observing once again it's continual coming and going and as you breathe listen closely see if you can hear the sound that it makes if you can hear it liken this sound to the soft flow of wind through a tranquil forest canopy like the one overhead of you now you close your eyes and once again you can feel your body being penetrated with soothing light energy this time it's not the sun it is the subtlety of the moon and so eyes closed to the forest around you you feel into the silver light of this moon first it weaves its way into the crown and headspace reminding you to let go again and again and again as many times as is needed it then ebbs its way into your cheeks your mouth and your throat helping to release your jaw and anything you've been clenching onto there you then feel the moon's glow moving into your shoulders and as it does you release your shoulders into the earth words of the indian scholar and environmental activist vandana shiva come to mind you hear her whisper you are not atlas carrying the world on your shoulders it is good to remember that the planet is carrying you now the silver light seeps into the full lengths of your arms just as the sun did all those moments ago the silver light brings deep release to each of your muscles from those in your shoulders all the way down to your fingers let them go let each of those muscles surrender for the night you trace the silver light back up and into your chest now where it creates a sense of spaciousness your heart area illuminates with bright silver light and it grows with each inhalation if any thoughts arise from now on you can guide them into this luminescent heart for transformation now the silver thread of light weaves its way along your spine each vertebrae that it passes surrenders to the evening and eventually your stomach fills with this subtle silver glow and feel your breath as it moves into this space the silver glow expanding in your belly with each full breath and it softens all areas around your core front and back side to side this calming silver energy enters into your hips and pelvis bringing softness to this part of you one last time before sleep and then it weaves its way through your upper legs past your knees into your lower legs ending its journey at the tips of your toes just allow both legs to relax in their entirety take a few full breaths as you bathe in this silver light of the moon and if you find that there's any specific part of you that longs for a little more silver light energy draw your attention there let it fill to the brim with the light of the moon and when you are ready let the imagery of this silver light soften now the moon is still there high up in the night sky but you can shift your attention to any other anchor that feels soothing for you perhaps you focus on the breath inhaling and exhaling the fresh nourishing air perhaps you focus on what it feels like to be held against the earth by gravity what it feels like for each part of your body to fully surrender each muscle to fully relax into the surface beneath you perhaps you gaze up at the milky way at the tops of the trees or at some other point in nature that soothes and settles you just whatever brings you a sense of peace presence and well-being let that be your anchor for a short while longer and slowly now i invite you to release the imagery of the forest from your mind as you gently shift your awareness back to this physical reality keep your mind soft you've not physically gone anywhere and so you don't need to return you've always been here you've always been held by this space the entire time if you are still with me i trust that sleep will be coming soon for you between now and then use whatever anchor you please to keep your attention focused and your mind calm the peace and tranquility you experienced here tonight was not a product of anything outside of yourself it came from within remember this deeper truth anytime the mind seems to wander off on its own remember that you hold the power in all moments in all breaths to bring yourself back to peace the seeds of your inner forest refuge are always there always available to be tuned into good night my friend good night you

1 hello my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to fall asleep quickly and effortlessly after a brief journey through the body we will take a trip into the cosmos during which you will fall asleep swiftly held beneath the soft glow of the moon and the stars allow the words of this meditation to flow effortlessly through you there is nothing you need to hold on to allow yourself to surrender into slumber at any point during this practice [Music] now to begin ensure that all end-of-day activities are taken care of your blind should be drawn any required alarms should be set and all lights turned off or shut out so that your body knows it's time to rest deeply eyes closed take a moment to land in the space that holds you making any necessary adjustments to your posture for extra comfort let your neck form one straight line with your spine as all muscles soften into the bed or other surface beneath you [Music] turn your attention towards the breath as you spend a few moments grounding through this force of life that gently ebbs and flows through your body as you watch your breath know that there is nothing it needs to do in no particular way it needs to flow our breath contains a wisdom that knows just how to support and nourish us all that is required is that we slowly step out of its way by easing the mind and relaxing the body as we move through this practice know that you can come back to the breath any time you need to anchor yourself back into the present moment the breath your physical body and these words all serve that purpose each invite you to come back down into the sweet simplicity of this night now let's take a moment to travel through the body softening each part that our awareness moves through begin now by drawing your attention to the crown of your head holding your awareness there for a few moments [Music] imagine this uppermost part of your body softening and a process that trickles down slowly to ease your forehead your eyebrows and your temples let your entire top half of your head relax releasing all physical and mental tension it might be holding and then slowly let this softening seep into your cheekbones and your jaw your mouth and your tongue as your awareness gently descends further it brings softness to your neck and your shoulders helping them to release any weight they may have carried throughout the day and then envision that softening trickling down your arms relaxing each and every cell all the way to your fingertips returning your attention to your heart space now allow your chest to relax and your upper back as well and then slowly scan the length of your spine downwards inviting all tissues and muscles that surround it to surrender deeper into this night [Music] your attention centers itself in the belly now and let all muscles around your core relax as the belly rises and falls with each breath and then allow your awareness to soften the hips the pelvis and the buttocks before gently trickling down the legs softening each muscle completely until arriving at the tips of your toes [Music] hold your entire body in your awareness letting it surrender completely into the surface beneath you you might notice a heaviness within your body as well as a lightness the sense that your body has given up completely to the weight of gravity while at the same time feeling entirely free and weightless let yourself revel in that sensation for a few breaths now the feeling of being held by gravity while also freely floating within the airy cosmic universe [Music] [Music] in just a moment we will begin a journey into the stars floating gracefully away from the earth yet before we do so let's take a moment to realize where we are truly headed and that is into a deep and restorative slumber so before we begin our ascension into the cosmos take a moment to silently repeat i let go let go i let go surrendering completely to the weightlessness of [Music] sleep in your mind's eye as your body and mind become lighter i invite you to envision that you are resting in an open meadow beneath the starry sky a soft blanket of grass rests beneath you your body is kept warm amidst the summer air the breeze whistles in the leaves of nearby trees rustling through tall grasses as well the night sky is onyx black reflecting darkness into your eyes but for the dazzling stars and crescent moon above you [Music] the world is quiet around and within you you inhale the evening air filling yourself up with the airy cosmos you are a part of each breath in brings a lightness to your body [Music] and each breath out helps you to let go to surrender to the sky above and around you as your body gets lighter you notice the earth beneath you drifting away suddenly you are light enough to be untouched by the weight of gravity your body rising above the ground and into the night sky you are not afraid you know you are protected here so surrender to the process you are in allowing yourself to be carried away from the earth and into the stars [Music] your body floats higher and higher passing through thin veils of cloud that grace the atmosphere the air around you is quiet as is your mind space up here amidst the clouds and beneath the light of the moon nothing of your life on earth seems to matter all that matters is this miraculous open space you drift through drifting further away from the earth you take a moment to look down upon it the entire globe is in full view the atmosphere around it dark and peaceful and twinkling lights shine back at you as if mimicking the stars no sounds of the earth can be heard from where you are no traffic no wind no moving water you are miles away now [Music] your entire body floats higher still and as it does the stars become larger and brighter [Music] your eyes land on one star in particular and everything else seems to melt away you spend some time with this star whispering your intentions for the coming day and inviting it to support you in surrendering to the night your breath is still soft nourishing you as you float high above the earth you take one last moment to commune with your favorite star before letting your attention widen to all the other celestial bodies that find their home within the sky planets comets and shooting stars all come into view as you gaze into the abyss of the cosmos still you know you are held safe by the universe here you are calm peaceful and entirely at ease [Music] you consider all the constellations that are spread out before you indeed they look different from this higher vantage point their patterns not so easily observed this close up and yet you reflect upon some of your favorites orion libra capricorn and aquarius now that you are here in the realm of all the constellations [Music] you understand why ancient traditions and cultures have long held up these celestial formations the closer you get to them the more remarkable they come the more they enchant your mind heart and soul come back to your breath with full awareness now inhaling and exhaling deeply your body remains light and free as you drift through the cosmos reveling at the stars now like a feather gliding through the air slowly and steadily you feel your body slowly coming back down some magic mysterious force holds you supporting you as you move gracefully away from the realm of planets stars and the moon you do not return to the earth just yet though with grace you land gently upon a plush supportive cloud you release a deep sigh as you sink into this cosmic cushion letting it support you from head to toe as you rest here you find stillness [Music] you gaze up at the mystery of the atmosphere above you eyes landing on the silver of the moon that is transitioning through its waning face in a few nights from now it will become a dark and dazzling new moon and yet for now it is waning slowly growing smaller at a rate too slow for the human eye to catch in a single moment you consider the energy of the waning moon remembering that this particular lunar transition is a time for releasing slowing down surrendering and restoring now is the time to sink into non-doing to let yourself be exactly as you are perched on a cloud you take three full breaths each inhale lasting to a count of four and each exhale being a little bit longer lasting to a count of six inhaling for four and exhaling for six [Music] you finish one more breath this way allowing your exhale to cleanse you of any residual tension or weight you may be unconsciously holding allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm your body is relaxed your mind is relaxed and you are ready to completely surrender you take one more moment to gaze up at the night sky from this height you thank it for all that it has illuminated within you and then slowly you drift like a feather once again inching your way closer towards the solid earth as you make your final approach held through this transition by a gentle and mysterious force you count down from ten to let go more completely ten your mind is quiet held in the silence of the night nine your body is relaxed fully trusting of the universe that supports it eight your heart is open awake to the mystery and beauty of the world seven your shoulders surrender the weight of the world having been freed from them six your jaw is relaxed knowing there is nothing that needs to be expressed five your hands are free free of any desire to grasp attain or achieve 4. your legs are relaxed knowing there is nowhere they need to carry you three your soul is at peace pleased with the journey it has just embarked on two your eyes and eyebrows are softened knowing there is nothing left to be seen one your entire body is aligned feeling fully prepared to take the next journey into slumber zero your body grounds back down gently slowly coming into contact with the earth once again as the journey through the stars is now but a memory take a moment to let all visuals disappear from your mind as you come back to the felt experience of being held by the surface beneath you from head to toe every part of your miraculous body surrenders your mental and emotional body to sink into a soft and tranquil stillness connected once again to the physical earth that supports you you revel in the sensation of being both heavy and light simultaneously feel gratitude for the force of gravity re-tethering you to the beautiful and solid earth beneath you and deep appreciation for the mysterious enchanted realm of the cosmos for the lightness illumination and the magic it offers just allow your breath to flow through you with ease once again slowly allowing it to guide you into the final stage of surrender for the night with each exhale you let go you let go you let go sleep well my friend sleep well so you  English (auto-generated)

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this guided meditation this is the positive miracles guided sleep meditation I'm Jason Stephenson we're often told about the importance and power of being positive but knowing that we should be positive is one thing but actually being positive is another and when the day's stresses pile up and things don't work our way it's too easy to give in to our emotions and feel anything but positive and it makes it harder for us to go to sleep when this continues we sometimes give in to feelings of inadequacy believing that we're not good enough or worthy enough and never will be at the very worst we may begin to suspect that there's a vast conspiracy determined to foil us at every turn and thus cynics are born these perpetuate a terrible cycle they believe they're not good enough or that things will never work their way they therefore become blind to wonderful opportunities awaiting them at every corner thus reinforcing their own beliefs and this is the prison of negative thinking now this meditation is the antidote to such a prison the aim of this meditation is to get you to sleep with miracles of positive and kind intentions so let's begin now for this one you can prepare as you would go into sleep lying down on your back or you can sit upright with your spine straight and this allows you to maintain an upright but comfortable position without strain to help you breathe more easily and maintain a good balance let your shoulders relax and rest your hands palms up on your lap or by your side if you are lying down this stabilizes you rolls your shoulders back and opens up your rib cage now facing straight ahead and pretend that you're the CEO of a major company or the ruler of a powerful country in your hands lies the fate of millions you are a very important person so project your power through your upright and confident but relaxed posture and because of who and what you are you have earned the right to just be for now all appointments meetings schedules and deadlines they can all wait but now they must take a back seat to what you are about to do so keeping your lips closed relax your jaw so that there's a gap between your teeth and rest the tip of your tongue against the back of your upper teeth gently close your eyes so your work can begin now please pay attention to your breathing and notice how it moves in and out of your body and how your body responds to it and that's breathing now in and out through your nose notice how your body feels a sense of expansion as you breathe in and how your body contracts as you exhale bring your focus now to your stomach and as you breathe in bring the breath here so that it bloats with each inhalation and as you exhale feel your stomach contract you [Music] so in a few more moments I'm going to direct your breath by asking you to inhale and to exhale to a slow count of three ready inhale one one-thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand exhale one one-thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand inhale 1 2 3 exhale 1 2 3 inhale exhale now trying to keep this pattern of slower breathing for the remainder of this meditation just slowing it down naturally you don't have to mentally count each breath but just seeing if you can keep it nice and slow and steady maintain your focus on breathing into your stomach so it expands with each in-breath and contracts with each out breath you can visualize that your stomach is a balloon that grows and shrinks with each inhalation and exhalation you you still maintaining the pace of your breath think back to an incident where you put a smile on someone's face now you don't have to remember their names all that matters is that you made someone happy and that you did it with no thought of getting something back it doesn't have to be something major it could be something as simple as holding the door open for someone or giving a child a piece of candy or offering someone a sincere compliment that made their day now if several incidents come to mind pick the one where the recipient of your kindness expressed a genuine gratitude can you remember what they said or what they did just dwell in that memory for a few moments and try to recall as much detail as you can [Music] do you remember how you felt in that moment did the other person's reaction surprised you maybe it made you feel good maintain your even breathing but just keep that memory and enjoy the feeling I'd like you now to remember a time when someone did you a kind Act preferably one that you so badly needed but never expected now again you don't have to know the person's name or even remember the details of their face just try to recall as much of the incident as you can did it happen at night or during the day what happened just before the person or persons came along did you ask for help or did they just volunteer to help what did they do to help you do you remember how you felt in that moment did you feel surprised grateful did you express your gratitude if so how did it make you feel valued noticed no longer invisible that there are indeed good people in the world just take a moment to explore that memory and to relive what you felt still maintaining the slow even pace of your breath I'd like you to consider the following thought the gratitude you've felt toward another was the same gratitude that another felt toward you it might be a feeling of lightness and peace one where the world seemed right even if only for a moment but the person to whom you were kind they too felt what you are now feeling that the world seemed right because they were good and kind people in it people like you no matter what your situation is like no matter the state of your finances or relationships no matter the state of your health or the demands on your time and attention this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you if you but hold on to it no matter how much or how little you have no matter your state of mind or how you feel this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you if you hold on to it no matter what your country's social political or economic situation is like and how it affects you this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you you hold on to it by understanding that this is your innate nature that's why it feels so good because it's your default State this is how you came into the world and how you may have spent the first years of your life until you grew older and forgot your true nature you are not your gender nor your sexuality nor your job nor your economic status nor your nationality or political affiliation you are yourself a being filled with love with light with peace and joy you are a person who seeks happiness and miracles and wants it for others as well because you know that this is the default State for everyone your pain is the result of knowing this truth but seeing another that's why you come alive when someone shows you kindness because it reminds you of their innate nature and that's why you feel powerful and validated when you show kindness to another because it is a reminder of your own innate nature you may not be the CEO of a major company or the ruler of a powerful country but you have a power similar to theirs the power to change the lives of others and it begins with one thought that I am good and therefore have the power to demonstrate the goodness or to withhold it it begins with one act the power to sit or stand up straight and undefeated confident in understanding of your own innate goodness finally it projects itself with one simple but sincere smile one that makes you feel good and because you feel good you pass that feeling on to another changing another's day for the better by making them feel the same and when another person feels good they pass on that feeling on to another who passes it on to another and so on continuing a chain reaction that began with you so you do have a tremendous power one that could potentially affect millions and indeed change the world for the better knowing this you cannot possibly be as helpless or as powerless as you have let yourself believe understanding this you can live each day with an upright posture a kind smile upon your face and creating miracles there are millions out there whose dahi depends on you and because their day depends on you so do their lives and the lives of others let go of your limitations and accept your own power and responsibility to shape the world into a better and more positive place it first begins with you rest well my friend rest well and go out create miracles change your life and at the same time changing the lives of others [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this loving-kindness meditation prior to sleep my name is Jason Stevenson and I will be taking you on this journey though this meditation was originally used in Buddhism you don't have to be a Buddhist to make it work for you nor do you have to subscribe to any religion or belief in Supernatural love and kindness are wonderful things but often we feel anything but sometimes it's easier to feel anger and hate but author Jonathan Lockwood who he also known as the philosopher of happiness put it best when he said forgive others not because they deserve your forgiveness but because you deserve peace now unfortunately that's often easier said than done but fortunately this meditation can help you so let's begin so please sitting upright but comfortably so if you'd like to rest your back against something that's fine just don't slouch or lean back because doing so will affect your breathing and if you want to lie down and do this before you drift off to sleep that's okay to just rest your hands palms face up on your lap or or by your side if you're lying down now close your eyes and focus on your breathing it's alright if thoughts and images come in so long as you keep most of your attention on your breath you're doing fine when you see a thought allow it to be don't try and push it down but you simply shift your focus back to your breathing I want you to remember a time when you did a kind thing for someone it doesn't have to be dramatic but I have two conditions the first is that you did it without a thought of a reward or an influence to that person and the second is that you didn't later regret what you did just reflecting on that do you remember how it felt did it feel good did you feel proud of yourself did it bring a smile to your face [Music] if you're smiling now that's all good that feeling stems from a core goodness within yourself now I want you to try to remember what you looked like as a child the younger the better that child you were for all their faults and mischievousness deserved patience and understanding that child you were also deserved loved could you see yourself wanting to protect and provide for that child [Music] could you see yourself wanting to hold and comfort that child just explore this thought for a moment [Music] you you now if you can just mentally repeat after me for all the ways that I harm myself negate doubt belittle myself judge or be unkind to myself through my own confusions I forgive myself and if there is a situation I am not yet ready to forgive I forgive myself for that too may I feel loving-kindness may I be filled with loving-kindness may I be held in loving kindness may I be happy and peaceful may I appreciate the gift of just being alive [Music] I'd like you now to bring to mind someone you love dearly it could be a parent a child a friend or even someone who's passed away can you remember their faces how they move [Music] do you know why you love that person can you remember the things they did to earn your love how do you feel or how did you feel when they were around you what does your love feel like to spend a few moments exploring this [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] imagine there in front of you now and mentally repeat after me if I have harmed you in any way either knowingly or unknowingly through my own confusions I ask your forgiveness if there is a situation you are not yet ready to forgive me for I will be patient you have harmed me too perhaps knowingly or unknowingly through your own confusions but I forgive you and if there is a situation I am not yet ready to forgive you for please be patient [Music] may you feel loving-kindness may you be filled with loving-kindness [Music] may you be held in loving-kindness may you be happy and peaceful may you appreciate the gift of just being alive [Music] now please try to hold on to that love and think of someone you neither like nor dislike it could be your mailman a co-worker or simply you see someone every day but have never spoken to [Music] can you remember their faces how they move what they sound like if you've spoken to them now your love might be weakening a little at the moment try to hold on to that love you felt for the other person as you picture this new one [Music] what if you knew that this person has children they love very much children they'd be willing to suffer for would that change your feelings about them consider that they may have pain and suffering but they might also want happiness for themselves and those they love might that warm you toward them a little imagine that they could be kind to you if you gave them a chance does the thought of loving them with the same intensity still seem strange can you imagine the possibility of it could you fake it a little could you try to feel the love you felt for the other person and keep this new person's face in mind just try to explore this thought over the next few moments [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] mentally repeat after me may you feel loving-kindness may you be filled with loving-kindness may be held in loving-kindness may you be happy and peaceful may you appreciate the gift of just being alive whatever living beings there may be may they all have happy minds may I not deceive another nor despise anyone anywhere even when angry or upset [Music] may I not wish ill upon another just as the mother would protect her only child with her life even so mayor cultivate a boundless love towards all beings may I radiate boundless love towards the entire world unhindered without ill-will without enmity I'd like you to go back now and remember the person you love so much picture their faces and imagine that they're with you remember what it feels like when they're present and rest in that thought for the next few moments [Music] and now the hard part bring to mind someone you dislike it doesn't matter why you dislike or hate them but could even be someone you've never met perhaps some public figure whose blood makes you boil for some other reason if there's no such person in your life think of someone you've recently had a spat with and are still upset with I'm going to assume you've brought up someone you dislike let your emotions come but don't try to justify them simply let the experience of dislike come as your heart beat faster is a dialogue now coming into your header along the lines of I should have said this or I should have done that focus on your breathing but don't let the feelings go [Music] you I want you to imagine what this person you dislike might look like as a child long before they created whatever drama it is that upsets you so much try to create some emotional distance and imagine how they might act as a child perhaps when they were three or four [Music] visualize a small of them with a higher pitched voice and a face without whatever expression that annoys you so much [Music] [Music] could you see yourself hating this imaginary child if this child were hurt or upset could you see yourself wanting to pick them up perhaps hugging them to give them some comfort if you saw this child alone and scared could you see yourself walking away [Music] [Music] what could you see yourself putting aside your own feelings to comfort someone in the midst of their own pain and suffering [Music] now imagine this person as they are now if you saw them alone and scared far away from wherever it is you have to interact with them if you saw them vulnerable suffering and in pain and know that this is that same child you would have comforted could you still dislike or hate them with the same intensity or could you see yourself softening a little [Music] if you could see this person holding a little child tenderly perhaps comforting that child could you see yourself softening a little more could you be a little less angry or upset with such a person if you could talk to the child this person was what would you say [Music] you you [Music] mentally repeat after me if I have harmed you in any way either knowingly or unknowingly through my own confusions I ask your forgiveness if there is a situation you are not yet ready to forgive me for I will be patient you have harmed me too perhaps knowingly or unknowingly through your own confusions but I forgive you and if there is a situation I am not yet ready to forgive you for please be patient may you feel loving-kindness [Music] may you be filled with loving kindness may you be held in loving kindness may you be happy and peaceful may you appreciate the gift of just being alive whatever living beings there may be may they all have happy minds may our not deceive another nor despise anyone anywhere even when angry or upset may I not wish ill upon another [Music] just as a mother would protect her only child with her life even so mayor cultivate a boundless love towards all beings may I radiate boundless love towards the entire world unhindered without ill-will without em nity you can stay with this meditation now for as long as you wish and if you still can't let go then forgive yourself you can always return to this exercise at another time [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] you
1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to the deserving and manifesting abundance guided meditation [Music] it is the innate tendency of nature to grow and become more to produce more and create more of everything there are always babies being born new trees sprouting new plants growing new things are constantly being invented cars produced houses being built jobs created and new technologies being developed on a daily basis all around us the universe is always expanding and growing just as abundance is everywhere in the universe it can also appear in your personal life if you intend it and allow it to be you may not feel you have access to this abundance you may think you a li innate yourself from it and prevent it from manifesting in your life well it's time to change that tract abundance into your life you need to feel abundant you must believe you are worthy and deserving of great abundance you have to develop an abundance consciousness abundance consciousness means becoming aware of the existence of abundance of feeling it in your life and of connecting with it even if it doesn't seem to be a part of your life at this moment this kind of consciousness means feeling and believing that you are a part of it you are surrounded by it abundance lives within you intending it and releasing it out into the universe is all we need to begin with abundance consciousness breaks through the limiting beliefs of your mind and opens you to wider opportunities and a wider point of view so now let's get comfortable and allow ourselves the time and space to relax and manifest abundance in our lives you so finding a comfortable place either sitting or lying down that you won't be disturbed for the next 20 minutes or so and closing your eyes your arms can be placed beside you and begin this meditation by taking in three deep breaths in through the nose sending that breath all the way down and releasing it letting it go feeling that breath rise all the way up and out and return your breathing back to normal change it just being aware of it in feeling that stomach expand as you breathe in breath out feel your stomach contract just be in this moment and be aware of this breathing for a few moments and I will return if a thought arises during this time simply go back to focusing on your breathing it's all okay it's a part of the process of meditation [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as you begin to relax now I'd like you to visualize laying beside you an envelope with a golden wax seal stamped with an ornate letter a written upon it you lift this up and gently break the seal and open the flap inside is an invitation addressed to you it reads you are invited to celebrate your outstanding contributions to the people in your life and to the world as a whole a ceremony will be held in your honor follow the illuminated pathway as you put down the invitation you notice on the floor of your room an illuminated pathway appears begin to follow this pathway and you'll notice with each step the pathway glows more intense you noticed an arched doorway appears in your room where there was no opening before walk through this doorway and run your hands over the edge of its surface as you pass over the threshold you find yourself in a very large beautifully decorated opulent room filled with silk draped tables elegantly set and well-dressed people the ceilings are high in flying buttresses reach from one side of the room to the other beautiful stained glass windows surround this space the architecture is magnificent as are the room settings take a moment to look around at this majestic room what sort of lighting do you see what are the floors made of and how are the tables set how does it feel to be in this amazing opulent space move further into this room towards the smiling crowd there is nothing to be afraid of here music plays as you walk through the room toward the crowd [Music] [Music] [Music] others in the room are looking at you proudly acknowledging you with a nod of their heads and one by one people come up to you and shake your hand or embrace you telling you how happy they are to see you congratulating you on your achievements and thanking you for all you have done for them to better their lives you recognize some of the people there are family friends co-workers loved ones from all walks of life and yet many of the faces are unfamiliar to you to continue walking through the crowd smiling and thanking them for their kind and gracious works he reached the center of the room where there is a large silk draped table covered with flowers and candles in the center of the table is a large ancient treasure chest you turn to look at the people who have all gathered around you one person you immediately recognize walks up beside you holding two champagne glasses one is handed to you this person speaks we are all gathered here to celebrate the amazing person you are and the incredible things you have done for each of us in your lifetime I know you don't know some of the people standing here but through your actions you have touched and made a positive impact on each of us it may or may not have been a direct action but somewhere down the line it was you that changed each of our lives you are an amazing person and you deserve true abundance in your life you are worthy of all the best y has to offer unlimited wealth and good health unrestrained joy unconditional love and pure peace please accept this gift as a token about love and gratitude for being a part of our lives and for being yourself in the world everybody raises a glass and cheers for you applause breaks out the crowd encourage you to open the chest and as you do the room suddenly grows silent everything stops the light changes and now instead of music sounds of nature can be heard birds calling forest sounds you turn to see that everybody has vanished and you now stand in a beautiful outdoor forest setting the stone columns and flying buttresses have been replaced by tree trunks and branches foliage and earth replaces the opulent flaws and instead of candle lights sunlight streams in all around you you are now alone in this magnificent space with a beautiful gift this wooden chest the table and all upon it have vanished and the chest lays upon an earthen pathway beside beds of beautiful flowers at your feet you've been down and lift the lid of the chest light floods out and envelops you you're reaching to the light inside the chest and you find a note it reads you the owner of this chest for all the solace acts of kindness you have bestowed upon the people in your life have earned great abundance when you close the lid tell the chest what you want if it is wealth you see speak the words then open the chest again take some time now to state to this ancient chest what you would like in your life it may be health financial abundance better relationships and abundance of happiness whatever it is set your intention and know deep within your heart with an unwavering belief that you are worthy you are deserving and by setting your intention you are activating the law of attraction and abundance to receive these gifts in universal time and so it is enjoy these next few moments [Music] [Music] [Music] when you feel comfortable in knowing this chest is a treasure chest that will change your life for the better you close the lid and you pick up the note again you continue to read this chest is your gift use it as you see fit to fill your life with the abundance you so rightly deserve place your hands upon the chest and all that you asked for draw it into your heart trust in the universe or powers and you can bring it forth anytime you wish peace love and light be with you looking to the ride you see a large tall oak tree in front of sit or lay down in the sunlight close your eyes and take a deep breath taking in the scent of the forest and the earth hold the breath for a moment and release it begin to feel your body resting upon the surface where you first began this meditation breathe in old and release know that you can come back to this meditation and activate this ancient chest whenever you desire abundance coming back now when you were ready come back fully into your body and open your eyes welcome home [Music]

to support you fully so there is no need to hold your position and you can be completely relaxed become aware of your feet now notice this area and simply relax move your attention up from your feet and begin to release your lower legs and knees feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and goes deeper into relaxation as you allow it to let go and now find the sense of ease in your thighs and hips as you let go completely moving up noticing the area of your lower back and abdomen take a deep breath to move your energy and attention here to release any tightness in your lower back continue

mind let yourself go let your mind and body go to a deep and relaxed State and now that you are fully relaxed you can turn your attention inward by checking in with what is true for you since what you are actually feeling give yourself permission to experience in this present moment without trying to change anything without allowing thoughts to take over let your thoughts come and go there is no need to attach to them or follow your thoughts imagine your thoughts are like a river flowing gently downstream let your thoughts go so you can be here now make space for the truth to surface in whatever form it comes simply allow it to surface make space for awareness and acceptance without judgment whatever you're feeling is okay these are simply patterns that have developed they are not you recognize the self-talk going on in your mind and let your thoughts come and go allow yourself to move out of the thinking patterns and bring your attention to your felt experience no need to attach words or labels to your feelings simply explore what those feelings are pause and allow these feelings give yourself permission to be with this experience let your thoughts come and go [Music] if you find your mind drifting going back to old patterns of thinking or overthinking lovingly come back gesture your attention to come back to the present moment sensations once more being present is the way stay in the moment stay with the feelings and be okay with it continue to make space in your heart for these feelings to come up and simply be stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment longer as you continue this relaxed inward awareness become aware of any thoughts arising witness them as if you are witnessing a flowing river of thoughts see them surface flow by and disappear each breath cycle Rises and is released similarly our thoughts rise and are then released let this idea this knowledge be a comfort to you to allow your thoughts to drift down the flowing river of thoughts as you observe them as you let your thoughts come and go you may find it helpful to name these thoughts as they arise identify them as a way to simply be aware of thinking after they have been named witness them as one drop of water in the flowing river of thoughts moving with each of the other thoughts rising and falling and flowing away let your thoughts come and go [Music] [Music] like your breath rising and falling away your thoughts to rise and fall away no matter how many thoughts come up allow them to flow by if you find yourself following a thought or reacting to a thought bring your attention back to the sensations in your body notice your felt experience let your thoughts come and go [Music] if we resist the current of the flowing river of thoughts it will continue to rush against us pushing in opposition perhaps giving you the feeling of being stuck if we accept it allow it we drift effortlessly along with the current [Music] the awareness of your thoughts allows you to let go of the hold they may have on you continue noticing your thoughts as they arise and allow them to drift away you may even notice your thoughts coming with more space between them when you practice allowing them to rise and fall as with the cycle of the breath if you find you get swept up with a thought with compassion and patience bring your awareness back to the sensations of your body now allow yourself to go deeper still allow all of the thoughts to go let your scanning awareness drift off simply be present with your truest self letting all the layers of yourself dissolve let what seemed like boundaries blur since a place inside of you that is the place of your inner wisdom your intuition here inside you is where your present awareness and insights reside when you pause and simply be your mind stops and you open into expansiveness open into spaciousness [Music] take a moment now to open yourself up and be receptive to

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this short mindfulness meditation to help increase your awareness of both breath and body in this present moment my name is jason stevenson and i invite you to simply follow my words of guidance as we move through this meditation and know that there is nothing you need to know and no experience you need to have in order to practice this so to begin just take a moment to let yourself come to a comfortable seated position or lying down if that's comfortable for you you can be in a chair on the bench seated on the floor or whatever is most comfortable and wherever you find yourself just take a moment to check in with your posture ensuring that your spine and neck form one straight line and your shoulders are relaxed just rest your hands in your lap your knees or your thighs and then close your eyes if you've not done so now take a few silent moments to let your mind arrive in this present moment [Music] often when we go into meditation it takes the mind a few moments to settle in to let go of its attachment to the past or its ideas about the future you can help it to arrive by simply tuning into the surface beneath you noting what it feels like to be held by gravity against the floor or the chair below you once you feel firmly grounded and connected to the earth beneath you just let your attention shift gently towards the breath without looking for anything in particular in the breath's flow simply observe its movement into and out of your body you might notice the temperature of the surrounding air as it enters your nostrils or the feeling of the body expanding and contracting with each breath cycle if you notice the mind wandering at any point simply notice this movement with patience curiosity and compassion and note that it's entirely natural for the mind to wander so practice non-judgment when you notice that this is occurring just silently invite your attention back to the breath when you notice that thoughts have pulled your attention away [Music] now i invite you to let your attention and your awareness broaden to hold your entire physical body within the scope of its lens notice what it feels like to be here to fully occupy your physical being in this moment [Music] just as was the case when you observe the breath there is nothing unusual or particular you need to look for tuning into the body is a process of simply connecting with the subtle sensations of being alive you might notice tingling tension contraction or expansion or even numbness or any other barely traceable sensations just simply notice what is here inside of you [Music] now let your attention focus in on a single sensation you may have come to observe if nothing has stood out to you simply let your awareness land on either the heart space or your third eye area just in the middle of your brows [Music] whatever point of the body your attention has landed on i invite you just to stay with that notice what is there and even if that feels like numbness or emptiness just notice be with it and refrain from judging any sensations as good or bad just watch with openness and just see what happens [Music] if or when the sensation dissolves just gently shift your focus to another single point in the body alternatively you can stay exactly where you are continuing to be present with that original point of interest [Music] now i invite you to consider is there any part of your body that might be yearning for some love or attention and let your attention on that place or stay where it is at the present and then imagine as if you are breathing nourishing energy into that part of your body with each breath so with each inhalation you might envision a gold healing light being sent to that area of your attention and with each breath out you might envision that same light carrying away any tension or stagnant energy [Music] inhale loving energy to nurture this single point in your physical body and exhale all tension away now i invite you to broaden your awareness once again slowly expanding your attention to hold your entire physical body and then continue to inhale those loving breaths or that golden light letting each breath nurture every cell of your body just imagine that your entire body each cell each muscle and each organ is breathing in and out now soften your forehead relax your belly and then slowly let all visuals fade as you come back to the natural flow of your breath and ground yourself once again in the surface beneath you and when you were ready to close this practice slowly open your eyes [Music] and as you move through your day remember that you can always come back to the immediate sensations of your breath and body to find peace presence and grounding thanks for joining me today [Music] you  English (auto-generated)    
1 [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to this short guided meditation to help you start your day on the right note by setting an intention and visualizing how you would like your day to unfold to begin this practice take a moment to find a comfortable seated position and however you find yourself seated elongate your spine as if your crown of the head is touching up towards the morning sun and allowing your shoulders to drop and your chest to open gently closing your eyes if you haven't already done so and then take a few moments to check in with your natural ebb and flow of your breathing and just notice if there's any restrictions or contraction that is inhibiting your breath from flowing into the fullness of your lungs and where it is possible for you to consciously shift this see where you might invite increased softness or surrender into your physical body [Music] you might relax the belly the jaw or your shoulders to facilitate the flow of this life force and now before we begin our intention setting and visualization practice let's just take three long deep breaths together and begin by emptying your lungs all of it and take a full deep breath into the belly for a count of four pause for a second at the top and then slowly let it go for a count of four another slow deep breath in brief pause at the top and then completely release as you breathe out one more full deep nourishing breath in and brief pause and then release with a soft sigh as you exhale and just let the breath continue to flow naturally as it awakens you to this day ahead now i invite you to take a silent moment to tune in with your heart as you reflect upon what intention you would like to set for your day it might be to move forward with courage and confidence to be loving and compassionate with those you interact with maybe to feel grounded and centered in your being or anything else that feels true to your most authentic self this morning [Music] and whatever it is take a moment to silently formulate that intention into a single sentence and then silently repeat it to yourself slowly with heartfulness and commitment and know that there is no right or wrong intention to set so you don't have to overthink it just let whatever arises from within your heart and be led by that now with this intention in mind and with your commitment to embody it in each minute an hour that unfolds i invite you to visualize your next few steps upon finishing this meditation where will you go next and what energy will you travel with there how will your body and mind feel as you move through the morning with your intention radiating out from within you picture how you will stand how you will walk what you will wear and which qualities you will carry with you and then follow your steps even further into the future what will your late morning look like your lunch hour or your early afternoon consider any interactions you will have the effortless moments the potential challenges and the simple moments in between picture yourself navigate all of these moments with grace ease and authenticity as you visualize yourself moving through the day notice how it feels to be you to be the you who lives in alignment with your highest intent let this energy embed itself in each cell of your being as you watch yourself effortlessly moving forward through the day consider next how you will transition into late afternoon and evening what interactions do you expect to have if there are any obstacles you imagine might cross your path know that you have within you what it takes to navigate these as best as can be done let your intention and the vision of your higher self guide your steps forward spend just a few final moments visualizing any important details about the day ahead and then empower these visions with trust faith and confidence in yourself and in your [Music] intention [Music] and when you are ready slowly let the imagery dissolve as you come back to your breathing watch the breath as it flows through the heart space and from the heart i invite you to silently repeat the following words i move forward in alignment with my highest intent [Music] i move forward in alignment with my highest intent [Music] i move forward in alignment with my highest intent and now just take three long deep breaths to close this practice [Music] and after that last breath whenever you are ready you can slowly open your eyes to the day and as you move forward let your intention and your highest visions empower the hours to come thank you for your time [Music]  English (auto-generated)

of your energy to gradually find stillness begin to connect with your breath and if it feels right to you take a long slow deep breath in hold it for a moment and then slowly exhale fully empty out and allow any tension to melt away as you gradually relax more and more deeply with each breath as you continue to breathe intentionally allow your exhale to be slightly longer than your inhale to welcome ease and relaxation to flow throughout your entire body [Music] take another long slow deep breath in pausing again and then exhale empty your lungs completely with your out-breath [Music] and again take a deep breath in to signal to your body and mind that it is your time to fully relax take your time hold for a moment and then let it go perhaps you can already feel yourself drifting into a deep state of relaxation like the leaves being released from the trees in the season of fall you can let go to make room for new possibilities to develop and present themselves in your life [Music] consider each breath out as a time for releasing any unwanted energies and allowing the energy that you do desire to develop within you this is your time to heal and to let go with each exhale let go of any tension in your body scan for areas that are holding on to something and give yourself permission to let go of that tension with each exhale surrender to gravity let go of any resistance [Music] with each exhale let go and soften deeper and deeper into the surface below you allow your body to soften a little deeper now allow the out-breath to exhale tension from your body we'll let go of anything you might be holding on to from yesterday or earlier today [Music] let go of any to-do list that may be taking up space in your ID give yourself permission to be here right now doing just this sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission in order to let go of the past give yourself some space space for something new space to grow into what do you want to let go of right now [Music] what has become too heavy a weight to bear on your journey [Music] like the falling leaves it's time to clear out and free yourself of things you may have been afraid to let go of in the past without the falling of the leaves there can be no new growth let go of anger let go of guilt let go of grief [Music] let go of sadness let go of judgments let go of comparisons let go of

surrendering to happen naturally throughout your body by simply offering your awareness to your body it is okay simply breathe and notice [Music] be aware of your inner physical experience just as it is you can allow yourself to simply be exactly as you are [Music] a peaceful mental state and an ease fulfill state are available when you are able to stop resisting your experience at any given moment when we want things to be different than they are that is when we develop resistance or tension today practice letting go of resistance be here now just as you are and you can get into the flow [Music] as you notice your body sensations accept them just as they are whether you may typically label these sensations as positive or negative settle into your body except being in your body right now just as you are be with the sensations you experience accepting all that you are there is no need to make a change during meditation be just as you are accepting allows you to fully experience what is happening in the present to fully engage in life [Music] listen to what your soul is sharing with you right now continue to be receptive to these sensations for a few moments longer with love and kindness for yourself feel the lightness that has washed over you as you have shed the weight that you have been carrying around for far too long we can learn from our faults and grow from our experiences if we allow them know that without experiencing suffering we also cannot experience joy without darkness we cannot know light allowing life just as it is can lessen any struggle and perhaps any additional and unnecessary suffering continue to soften soften from the surface all the way to deep within you release any guarding you may be holding on to surrender to anything you were holding on to for fear of losing let go of what could have been let go of worry of the possibility of a new way let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders let the sensations dissolve from your muscles every day we get a new chance to be in this moment it is okay simply breathe and notice surrender to the ability of your body to heal itself surrender to the love within you know your ability to give and to receive love surrender let go and be held by pure love trust you are loved in darkness and in light all of you is loved simply trust [Music] notice once more how you feel and allow yourself to feel just as you are for an even deeper connection with yourself surrender to your breath feel your body being breathed being moved by your breath trust it's okay simply breathe and notice [Music] notice the sounds in your environment just as they are here are the sounds as they come to you without searching them out allow the subtle noises to drift into your awareness with simple curiosity take interest in the sounds just as they are simply allow the sounds to be rather than seeing them as a distraction or an obstacle if you can practice accepting the sounds just as they are without the desire to change you can also begin to practice acceptance and surrender in other areas of your life frequently the word surrender has a negative energy to it you may think of having to give up something that is important to you or lose control over a situation Surrender does not mean giving up when the word surrender is used as a mindfulness practice it can also be the opportunity to give up anything that is no longer serving you or anything that is keeping you stuck [Music] consider this beautiful quote by Debbie Ford surrender is a gift that you can give yourself it's an act of faith it's saying that even though I can't see where the river is flowing I trust it will take me in the right direction [Music] any obstacle or challenge in your life might actually be taking you in the right direction allow the flow of the energy of life [Music] when you feel life brings you challenges you can't accept you have the opportunity to be transformed by acceptance you may add suffering when you resist the way things are because they aren't the way you expect or want them to be [Music] you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the way things are naturally there is a possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true peace is available when you stop resisting any given moment [Music] although you don't have control of what goes on beyond yourself you do have a choice as to how you respond to your experience and this choice gives you the opportunity to experience in our peace you can decide your attitude in any given circumstance noticing the sensations in your body with a relaxed awareness once more since that you now feel as if the weight of tension has been lifted and released from your body you sense that you are feeling lighter now almost as if you are floating and gravity has let go of its effects on you [Music] this lightness comes from letting go of anything and everything weighing on you both physically and emotionally it has been lifted completely out of your body [Music] this release allows you to feel lighter physically and you drift into a more productive sleep to prepare you for the day ahead [Music] let go of tension [Music] let go of pain let go of negativity and make room for the rejuvenation of a deep night's sleep let this come to you easily and effortlessly in your mind here these positive affirmations as your own beliefs hear them as truth in this present moment let these statements move you towards a spiritual surrender allow these ideas to help you drift into a deep healing state you don't have to do anything simply listen and allow sleep to come easily to you eventually my voice will fade away and you will drift off into a deep healing state of sleep for many hours I am ready to release the past and move forward now [Music] I am ready to surrender and move forward now [Music] I surrender I allow I accept I surrender by giving up attachments to results [Music] I am freely allowing and enjoying this moment I surrender all struggle I forgive myself I release all attachments coming from me I let go of expectations I create space for new beginnings I am supported loved and cared for things always work out for me when I relax and let go when I stay calm the answers come to me easily and effortlessly everything is as it should be obstacles are part of my path [Music] I let go of old habits and choose new positive ones I choose the responses to my experiences I allow the lessons I'm learning I am filled with positive actions [Music] I release anything that no longer serves me [Music] I welcome positivity into my life I am at peace with what is happening each new day offers a clean slate I welcome health and happiness [Music] I am worryfree

1 hello and welcome to this guided meditation on letting go and sleep my name is Jason Stevenson and I will be taking you through a relaxation before hopefully you'll be having an immensely satisfying sleep today my aim is to assist you in completely letting go and surrendering before sleep before we begin set your personal space up for this wine down to a good night's sleep put away all distracting items and power down all your devices apart from the one on which you are playing this recording you may wish to take a moment to jot down any pending tasks which can wait until tomorrow it's vital to incorporate rest into your busy schedule and with a good night's sleep you recharge your batteries and rejuvenate your spirit for a great day ahead so without further adieu lie back into a comfortable position allowing your body to adjust your mattress feel your spine settling back and relaxing rest your head back against a pillow if that is your preference and just savor the relief of simply lying back after an active day if you haven't already done so let your eyes close naturally just allow the eyelids to gently come together no need to squeeze them shut and forget for the moment about trying to sleep just inhale deeply thinking to yourself breathe in hold your breath a little and then breathe out being conscious of your breath as our breathing comes under control so too does our mind it's not about trying too hard to control your breathing instead it's letting it occur naturally and just being aware of it you on your next breath in focus on the center of your forward hold your breath permitting it to gently soothe your forehead like a bomb and relax let go on your next breath in feel your eyelids become soft and relaxed and as you exhale notice how your eyelids get heavier and heavier as they welcome sleep on your next breath in breathing in and feel cool energy to your cheeks and hold your breath exhaling feel your cheeks lower comfortably like they just drop deeper and deeper relaxed on your next breath in focusing on your jaw muscles feel your teeth come apart and your lower jaw drop slightly if the tip of your tongue is stuck to the roof of your mouth let it fall and relax next bring your attention to your neck muscles and on your breath in energy of that breath to need away at your neck taking the strain away senior Nick further on your next breath in bringing a dose of relief to your back the energy run along your spine unwinding all the knots in your upper and lower back and on your next breath out allow any tension or aches to be carried away with this strand of exhalation feel your body relaxing deeper and deeper now breathe in again and bring your attention to chest pulling apart all the knots that wind your chest up tired and breathe out and savor this liberating relief of deep and satisfying relaxation breathing in again and this time feeling your shoulders let go they drop a little and the muscles in your arms your biceps and triceps and into the forearms feel any stress in this area melt away right down to the tips of your fingers you breathing in again and sending the breath right down to your abdomen and feel it expand and contract as you breathe out just letting it sink back in naturally and sending you into a deeper state of relaxation introduce some of that relaxing energy to your legs as you take the next breath in upon breathing out let any remaining pressure escape through the tips of your toes and your outward breath you through the breath you bring balance to your system with each conscious breath you become more and more aware of the present moment very moment you simply are you are perfect you are whole just take a moment now to observe the natural flow of your breathing you notice how with each breath in your chest izes and with each breath out it falls up and down just like the steadily swinging pendulum of life you bring your attention to this precise moment to struggle or to force yourself to do this by simply coming back to your breath you will return to the moment and become aware of it just breathe in and then breathe out from the start of a new day right up to the end we are exposed to thousands of thoughts don't try to fight your thoughts simply observe them witness them and then coming back to your breath slowly let those thoughts go remember breathe in and breathe out you may find yourself thinking about a particular event or events that have passed slowing down the thought process drift among those memories witness them from above and recognize them tell yourself I'm thinking about this event I acknowledge it and as you breathe out move along with the breath detaching yourself a little more from that particular thought we must understand that we cannot change the past that we can learn something from it upon a lesson you might have learned from that event or those events again to not strain yourself to think of the lesson simply breathe in and breathe out again and if something comes to mind take it with you if not remain with the breath and you can always return for further reflection at another time breathe in and as you breathe out let the past flow through your system and out to become one with the universe sometimes we are overpowered by a sense of anger or grief and that in turn holds us back if this is the case view now if any of these thoughts arise just breathe in focusing on that breathing breathing afresh energy and on your breath out becoming fully aware of your breath in this state of relaxation your mind is operating at a slower more passive frequency you are hence able to observe these feelings of anger or grief without letting it affect you a moment now to reflect upon this did not try too hard to determine the source of it simply acknowledge its presence and then return to the breath there are opportunities to become angry and upset every now and again however it's important to remember that we have a choice of whether or not to feed these emotions and by merely coming back to the breath you can bring yourself back into alignment you can choose not to let these things bother you they are not worth your precious time if you have any anger or resentment as you inhale and exhale let them go reminding yourself that is not worth giving into you want more you are strong our belief systems can sometimes place restrictions on us however we can all make the choice to follow what we truly believe in make yourself aware of this choice through the bread inhale bring into your system that things that are most important to you bring to mind what you most value in your life and as you breathe out let go of those feelings that do not resonate with you and that hold you back from being the best version of your truest self but those beliefs go knowing they do not serve the true you in any way it may not be our beliefs but a troubling thought may linger after hours of the event in this census like a game of tennis there are times when you may lose a point but there are other times where you'll gain one the only thing to remember is to keep playing and to keep playing it's simply a matter of breathing therefore just breathe in and breathe out again there is no saying what the future holds for us to dwell on the uncertainty only brings more stress more anxiety through gratitude and appreciation of all the gifts life has offered you today be certain that tomorrow will be better reassert this on your next breath bring in all the wonders of your present life everything that you are grateful for only think of one or two things and they can be as simple as having a roof over your head or having your next meal all this breath just for a moment as you breathe out release all expectations of tomorrow let go of all control surrender and that weight of expectation will be automatically lifted here and now you are wholly present neither your past your future your troubles nor your beliefs can take this moment away from you this is the gift known as the present one that comes for all of us to embrace stay here for a moment in and out existing completely in this present moment let go of everything that is beyond your control you've done your part to the best of your abilities the rest now will be taken care of trust in life now you deserve the best and with the following affirmations you may surrender completely you can mentally repeat these to yourself I accept all the gifts that the universe has to offer me I am grateful for mirakl I find around every corner I appreciate my life by living it to the fullest I love the way I am and believe in my abilities I am totally free I choose to do things that make me happy I fully deserve to be happy I am loved and loved fully I am the best version of my truest self I am fully present in this moment I welcome wealth and abundance into my life I now surrender that which is beyond my control to the universe this is your final passageway to a rich and abundant sleep you've come a long way in accepting your present and letting go of that which has held you back you've worked hard and the sleep that beckons is fully deserved hold more miracles and blessings than what yesterday did expect the unexpected and surrender any pre-existing notions about the future just let them go focus now entirely on the breath and let it carry you on to your slumber follow your own natural rhythm breathing in and out and in your mind's eye visualize a trap door that opens up ten steps covered in thick crimson carpet that easily muffles your footsteps leads downwards to a pleasantly lit place of peace I will count you down from ten guiding each step that you take 10 take the first step holding onto the golden rail you are reminded of the soothing balm of your breathing 9 letting go surrendering eight going down deep Oh seven breathing in and out drawing and closer to a blissful sleep six five

1 tonight I have a treat for your bedtime routine clear the clutter of your mind slow down the momentum of your day and sleep peacefully the practice of meditation is about returning your attention to the present moment with acceptance and kindness for what you find it is about coming back to the present when you find yourself going down the rabbit hole of worrying thoughts the more you practice the more skilled you will become both in the practice as well as in everyday life meditation before bed is a wonderful way to quiet the raising thoughts and positively prepare for the day ahead today I will guide you to practice this skill to help lessen the level of stress and worry so that you can experience a tranquil deep sleep hello and welcome I'm Sarah Raymond from the mindful movement thank you for joining me today here we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mind set and heal from the stress that's blocking your fulfillment now I invite you to make yourself comfortable take a moment and make sure your environment is all set for you to drift off into sleep it is important for you to have the sense of safety so you can fully relax make sure the room is dark all screens and electronics are off and you are as comfortable as you can be if you are listening to this on electronic device turn the screens light away from you create the most comfortable environment you can pause this recording if you need a little more time [Music] we will start this meditation with your eyes open gently although your room is probably dark focus your gaze softly on one point a spot on the floor or the wall or perhaps just a sense of color in the darkness [Music] narrow your focus to this one single point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away let your focus rest on this one point stay with this narrow focus for a moment then as if this one point could get even smaller begin to draw your focus in until your eyes gradually closed and you allow your attention to turn inward [Music] invite your thoughts to do the same narrowing inward letting the momentum of the day gradually slow [Music] be patient with this process of slowing down [Music] when your eyes fully closed and your attention turns inward bring your awareness to your breath [Music] begin to count the length of your natural breath in and as you breathe out encourage your exhale to be one count longer than your inhale allow each long exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress or tension [Music] by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will slow and your body will calm down continue lengthening your exhale for a few breaths cycles letting go of the counting if you like and simply sense the full exhale [Music] know that your breath is an anchor or a reminder for you to come back to the present moment if you find your mind wandering or find you are distracted by sounds come back to your breath you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment [Music] in this gradual process of slowing down you may still have thoughts going through your mind simply notice them and let them move on as you come back to your breath [Music] as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and to slow down allow your body to soften and your breath to be calm if it feels right to you as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up [Music] and as you breathe out this white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of worry [Music] [Music] take a long slow deep breath in through your nose [Music] move this breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to surrender to the weight of gravity and relax as you exhale [Music] breathe out anything that no longer serves you on your journey to simplify [Music] each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even deeper inhale the bright white light exhale let go deeper and deeper allow my voice to be your guide into relaxation you can drift off to sleep when your body is ready [Music] and your subconscious mind will continue listening and relaxing even further like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down in relationship to each breath as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts [Music] invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen be in the gap no need to do anything simply be in this space [Music] in a moment now I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the top of your head going all the way through your body to your feet as I say each part of your body see this part in your mind's eye [Music] and you can relax that body part completely [Music] welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind [Music] encourage the weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface below you so that there is no need to hold on you can simply let go into sleep now as we begin to scan the body bring your attention to the top of your head [Music] intend to feel this area from the inside of your body as sensations only [Music] without moving your eyes as you scan your body simply move your awareness to each part [Music] and as your awareness flows throughout your body you can relax each part completely [Music] let's begin this relaxation process by noticing your scalp [Music] moving your awareness to your forehead as it softens [Music] notice your right eye [Music] and your left eye [Music] and that your awareness rest on both eyes together sensing the small muscles surrounding both eyes relax completely [Music] notice your right cheek since both the outside and the inside of your cheek the right side of your gums and the hinge of your jaw noticing now the outside of your left cheek and the inside your gums and the end of your jaw on the left no noticing both sides together allowing your awareness to relax you even deeper since your right ear [Music] noticing the inner ear and now your left ear [Music] the outside and your inner ear that your awareness rest on both ears together and now moving your attention to notice the right side of your neck and the left side of your neck [Music] notice the front and the back of your neck and since the entire circumference of your neck sensing now your right shoulder right upper arm right elbow and forearm right wrist and and fingers [Music] and now your left shoulder upper arm your left elbow and forearm wrist and and left fingers [Music] and now since the length of both arms hands and fingers together [Music] noticing the right side of your chest your ribs your abdomen and back and the left side of your chest ribs abdomen and back [Music] now both sides of your trunk together as they soften and that go into relaxation moving your awareness now to your right hip down to your thigh your knee and your lower leg sensing your left hip by [Music] knee and lower leg and now begin to sense both legs together notice your right ankle the top of your right foot the bottom of your right foot and your toes moving your awareness to your left ankle on top of your left foot the bottom of your left foot and your toes and then since both sides together continuing to relax slowly complete one more scan of your bodily sensations from your head all the way down your body as you do breathe into any areas of remaining tension to completely let go going deeper and deeper into relaxation [Music] [Music] feel that your mind and body have slowed down you have let go of thoughts you have let go of physical and emotional tension from your body as your body softens you can make room for your thoughts to dissolve into spaciousness your body relaxes and your mind can unwind you can clear the clutter of your mind [Music] now that you are calm and deeply relaxed imagine a scene in nature with a waterfall this can be a place you have been before we're an image from a photograph or video or purely imaginary whatever comes to mind is fine [Music] in your mind see this waterfall see how quickly the water moves over the edge flowing freely here the sounds of the rush of water going over the edge and splashing down below notice the momentum of the moving water [Music] below the waterfall the water is flowing into a river the water here moving a little slower yet there is still much momentum carrying the water away this river moves the water into a lake where the water is much calmer and eventually comes to stillness [Music] on the far side of the lake you can see the still water appearing with a glass-like surface reflecting the surrounding scene [Music] like the movement of the waterfall flowing into the river and into the calm lake your energy and your thoughts can slow down and just illness invite the slowing of the momentum of your energy from the day past the slowing of your thoughts in your mind [Music] imagine your thoughts are like a leaf floating in the water being moved from waterfall to river to stillness in the calm lake [Music] when you hold on you fight the current let go and drift effortlessly into peace that the current carry you away to sleep [Music] let go of any thoughts of worry any thoughts that might be holding you back from experiencing tranquility thoughts holding you back from sleep see these thoughts drift off in the flow of water they will be there when you need them in the calm state of your mind let go of your worries so that you can sleep peacefully now [Music] what you resist persists [Music] they acknowledge your thoughts with acceptance without the need to follow them off into story [Music] meet your present experience with permission [Music] allow your thoughts to come and go without resistance welcoming a calmness to wash over you completely [Music] [Music] and now you have prepared your mind and your body for a deep and restful night's sleep [Music] a new sense of calmness is emerging as thoughts come to mind you allow them to drift off in the current not to disturb your calm state with this warm sense of comfort you can now begin to drift off into a deep relaxing sleep you will sleep so well knowing you are ready for what the next day brings you are so incredibly relaxed your mind feels smooth and there is an inviting sense of inner peace flowing through your body you are ready to rest your mind for the night you are in the perfect place to get the best night's sleep [Music] and you will wake up tomorrow feeling rested and calm like the still water of the lake [Music] you are relaxed and feel a sense of lightness and spaciousness as you have let go of anything weighing you down [Music] sleep is inviting you to let go and surrender to your dreams allow this to happen if you wish take the final steps into a deep restful slumber your body knows exactly what to do to relax and allow during your very productive deep sleep as you drift off into serene peaceful rest my voice will gradually disappear and you will be deeply asleep [Music] when you wake hours later you will be energized rejuvinated and call [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to the magic book series guided meditation visualization I'm Jason and for the next 20 minutes or so just make sure that you cannot be disturbed switch off your mobile phones and close your eyes and as you close your eyes you feel every part of your body in contact with the chair or the ground you can feel every fiber of your body soften relax release picture the room around you the way it would look if you opened your eyes feel the sunlight all the darkness the warmth of the room the softness of your clothing against your body if any thought or tension from your day appears just smile at it and let it drift away when you return from this journey you will remember exactly what you will need to and only the truly important matters will be waiting for you when you come back this is your chance to let go of your day to sink into a deep sense of relaxation and serenity and to explore the hidden adventures of your own subconscious mind [Music] [Applause] [Music] as we move through this meditation continue to breathe deeply and notice the sensations that come up in your body releasing thoughts and anxieties as they come up enjoy the feeling of just being here in this moment bring your minds are into the room around you and as you picture your surroundings look closer at the wall nearest you see the hazy outline of a door appear notice its texture perhaps not at dark oak or a sleek blond wood notice how it is becoming more real more concrete [Music] now imagine standing up from your chair or reclining position and walking towards that door reach out your hand and touch it feeling it's cool solidity now grasp its handle and give it a gentle tug opening it to reveal a staircase leading upwards you cannot see what's at the top of these stairs but you know deep inside that it will be something calming and pleasant [Music] take that first step up the stair feel your feet against the stairs treads worn from so many years of use grasp the handrail and continue climbing up the stairs each step you take relaxes your body more and more causing you to breathe deeper and release any tension that may be hiding in your muscles at this moment [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] as you begin to get closer to the top of the staircase visualize the warm sunny light emanating from the room beyond it feel its gentle warmth against your face increasing as you get closer and closer to the top of the stairs breathing deeper and relaxing more fully take two more steps and you've reached the landing you're in a library of sorts with tall ceilings and enormous glass windows outside of the glass you can see fluffy white clouds moving across a cerulean sky watch them pass for a moment slow and graceful wisps against a calm blue background feel the glow of the sunlight against your eyelids in front of you is a soft upholstered chair with a small table next to it walk towards it noticing all the bookshelves you pass and the colorful intricately embossed spines of the books that reside there know that they don't matter right now as the book you need to read is already waiting for you resting on that little side table just ahead when you reach it sink into the chair feel its softness how it supports your back your neck your shoulders right where they may be aching exhale all this pain and tension and inhale breathing in total calm feel how easy it is to just dissolve into this chair releasing any thoughts that you've been carrying with you until now exhale deeply feeling entirely peaceful in this quiet serene place once you are ready pick up the book on the table next to you it is small bound in royal blue leather its title is stamped on the front in gold leaf just above a delicately embossed pattern of stars look a little more closely at this title sensing these golden letters rearranging themselves until you can read what they say this book is called relaxation run your fingers across the cover feeling the pebbly texture of the leather and the slight indentations of the embossed pattern know that when you open it you will be taken someplace new someplace totally calm that you can return to at any time you will be totally safe and will return to the library feeling even more peaceful than you do right now with that in mind open the book and see the printed words watch as they run together and grow until all you can see is the texture of the paper and the text getting larger and larger surrounding your body like a warm gentle bath watch the characters dissolve slowly but surely until you can feel yourself standing on a grassy hill you are surrounded by night sky and the white pin pricks of stars [Music] [Music] [Music] inhale smelling the sweet scent of night blooming flowers and growing grass feel a soft breeze across your skin look upwards at the sky inky sky and the way the stars resemble tiny pearls at the bottom of a dark ocean breathe in this night air notice the way it swells into your lungs totally absolving you of any tension in your body inhale deeper and enjoy the sense the breeze carries to you listen to the crickets chirping the occasional sleepy call of a now simply breathe it all in and exhale any thoughts or worries that surface in this serene landscape if you become distracted bring yourself back to the details all around you the breezes gentle caress the trees whispering in the wind the fresh scent of grass and soil when you turn around you'll see the twinkling lights of a city somewhere in this city lies an object that will help you attain total and complete relaxation do not worry your senses will guide you right to it so in a moment turn around and soak in the side of glimmering lights in the city below notice how the lights mirror the stars like a reflection on a still lake a glimmer in the night sky and the town's lamps below Sparkle creating a landscape of almost unending light the whole valley and sky is filled with gentle dancing brightness breathe it all in letting your senses absorb the quiet twinkling of the stars the breeze and the plants and animals around you feel how soft the soil beneath your feet supports you letting you stand totally comfortably and view this scene savor the way the breeze brushes around your skin washing away any cares and tensions like water [Music] [Music] know that you can return to this hill to this very spot anytime you wish as you observe the valley below you bring your attention to your feet planted on the ground underneath them there is a pebbly path just in front of you made from small white river stones it leads down into the valley and fades into the distance somewhere beyond the city you know that this path will take you exactly where you need to go and so as you begin to walk down it you feel any tension melting away left behind on the hilltop feel the way your feet press against the cool smooth stones the way the pebbles give way like sand notice the city lights getting closer as with each step you take tension dissolves and you relax more completely keep walking enjoying the sights and sensations surrounding you welcoming you to this peaceful place [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now that you're close to the city you see that the Whitestone path continues through it leading you through brightly lit streets and dimmer alleyways it flows over any obstacles that may be in your way keeping you totally safe and guiding you towards your ultimate destination as you pass houses and storefronts smile at the sounds of conversation and laughter inside their walls but do not worry about speaking to any of the inhabitants you may return another time and explore the nooks and crannies of this city but now you are drawn almost magnetically to what awaits you at the end of this path if you encounter figures or thoughts from your day know that they accept this and will happily await your return another day the white stone path continues onwards through the city every step pulls you closer and closer to its end where an item waits for you this object will be uniquely personal something with significance to you but do not worry about what it might be before you discover it know that whatever this item is it will help you attain peace and relaxation in both your meditation and waking life so as you feel yourself pulled along this path release any ideas about what this object might be or what it might mean breathe deeply inhaling the soft night air and gentle lights of this quiet city you are now leaving the city continuing out into the countryside beyond the lights notice how much easier it is to see the stars out here feel the way the soft grasses brush against your legs as you continue on this pebbly path breathing deeply and releasing any cares you may be still carrying you can see an outline of something a little further ahead something at the end of this path as you approach it you see that it is an old well and on it hang as a small lamp flickering slightly in the gentle night breeze approach it feeling the way the path pushes you towards it when you reach this well stand a moment and notice the sturdy time-worn stone although it has been here for many years everything is still in good repair when you are ready grasp the wells handle and turn it lowering the metal pail that hangs on it down into the ground there are a few small bells tied to the rope notice how they tinkle merrily as the pail descends happy to help you along your journey take a moment to enjoy the sounds of the sleeping valley around you [Music] continue turning the handle until you hear the pails splash as if it's water once it does exhale releasing your expectations along with your breath inhale turning the crank the opposite way to bring the bucket back up to you when the bucket reaches the top of the well there will be something inside it for you something to help you remember this feeling of total calm so when you are ready reach your hand in and pull out whatever lies inside it what is it hold this item in your hands feel its weight its texture its temperature notice how relaxed you feel totally devoid of any tension or anxiety in your body slip this gift from the valley into your pocket and carry it with you knowing that anytime you feel tense or stressed you can touch it and be instantly transported back to this state of calm [Music] [Music] now reach your hand back into the bucket and feel your fingers curl around something else something solid and rectangular withdraw it from the bucket the blue and leather gold embossed pattern glint in the moonlight this is the magic book you read before ready to take you back to the library when you are ready take a moment to look around you notice the Stars and the glimmering lights of this city savor the sounds of the wind and the nocturnal animals the way the cool white pebbles press against your feet smile at everything you encounter when you are ready open the magic book and begin to read watch the words on each page grow small and smaller multiplying until they fill your vision when you can no longer see the valley or the light they dissolve and you find yourself sitting back in the South upholstered chair all ivory [Music] feel the weight of the object you found in your

1 hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will help you to visualize yourself achieving the weight loss or physique that is of your highest intent my name is jason stevenson and i invite you to open your mind and this meditation will help to inspire you to achieve the physical body that feels perfect for you and to help you sleep well to begin this meditation just bring yourself to a comfortable resting position and ensure that all end-of-day activities are taken care of and that you are fully supported by whatever pillows or blankets you might need close your eyes if you've not already done so and just take a few moments to ground yourself through the natural rhythm of your breathing you don't need to change the breath in any way yet for now simply let it flow in and out as it yearns to be in this moment considering it to be an anchor for your awareness notice what parts of your body rise and fall as you breathe as well as any other physical sensations that you observe [Music] now softening the belly and seeing if your breath might naturally deepen as you shift your awareness further down into your body [Music] and i invite you to imagine each breath extending beyond both lungs and belly to awaken each and every cell of your being let each and every inhalation breathe itself into your whole body with each of these full body breaths imagine that every in-breath brings vitality and aliveness to your cells and that each breath out frees you of stagnation or lethargy so feeling into the stillness yet radiant vitality of your body in this moment and now before we move into a visualization to help us manifest our greatest aspirations for the physical body let's take some time now to hone our attention on specific energy centers within your body as we draw our attention through the body we will awaken the major energy points within it that help us to achieve this new physical reality so begin now by drawing your attention to the base of your spine to the root of your being with your awareness held here at the root chakra let each breath in fill this part of you with a renewed sense of connectedness to the physical world to the earth beneath you and to your very own body you are grounded connected and full of vitality now let your awareness shift slowly to the navel as you hold your attention on your core let each breath in create an expansion here filling you with confidence will power and determination to achieve your dreams you are strong resilient and empowered let your inward gaze now move away from the core as it lands in the heart space in the center of your chest and as you hold your attention here on the heart let each breath awaken your sense of self-love and unconditional worthiness you are loved worthy and wonderful and slowly now shift your awareness to your third eye to the center of your forehead and just slightly higher than your brow line and as you hold your awareness here let each inhalation awaken your capacity for inspired imagination as well as your ability to intuit what your body requires in any moment you see and believe in your highest potential you know what your body needs and now allow your attention to land on the crown of your head the top of your head let each inhalation rise to fill this part of your being and as it does allow it to fill you with a deep connection to the limitless energy of this world whatever you require to achieve the physical state you long for the universe can provide it you are connected supported and ready for transformation now let your focus open up as you come back to full awareness of your body now in your mind's eye i invite you to envision that you are standing on a warm and sandy beach gazing across azure blue waters and behind you staggering amber cliffs rise up towards the sky the contrast between the bright blue waters and this rich orange earth is mesmerizing you revel in the beauty and wonder of this space and as you turn back towards the sea you take a few moments to ground yourself into the place that you occupy through the soles of your feet you ground yourself into the soft sand and earth that supports you that provides you with vital earthly energy [Music] and through the crown of your head you connect with the limitless potential of the universe your mind is beginning to expand to let all possibilities filter into your awareness [Music] the upward moving energy from the earth meets with the downward moving energy from the cosmos landing in the center of your heart and grounding you in love these energies meet in the heart to ensure that all actions you take are rooted in and reflective of self-care self-kindness and self-love so take a few long deep breaths as you harness the energy above below and all around you and after your last long exhale let the breath come back to its natural rhythm as you envision yourself moving down the coastline how you move down this beach is entirely up to you perhaps you walk with grace run with strength dance with full expression or move in some other way that your body feels called to move in whatever mode of movement helps you to feel strong and stable in your body envision yourself flowing effortlessly along the sandy beach before you you are deeply attuned to the needs and wishes of your body in this moment note what it feels like to move in this way take this time to observe what feelings and sensations arise how does your body look as you move how does it feel to move with strength confidence and agility spend just a few more moments allowing yourself to move in a way that inspires you until soon the beach begins to narrow as it reaches its northernmost end [Music] from where you stand at the tip of this beach you realize you have two options to go back to the place you started at or to venture onwards and up you choose the latter and so you decide to climb the rock face that leads gradually up towards the peak of these majestic cliffs you follow a small foot trail that takes you a few meters up from the beach and that is where the work begins step by step you make your way up the mountainous terrain with confidence and strength your body is fully engaged and your mind is radiant and alive with each step you take you shed any and all limiting beliefs that hold you back from achieving your fullest potential your body too sheds any excess weight that no longer serves you or it builds the muscle the natural strength that you have long been yearning to cultivate perhaps it does both you feel and empowered to achieve the perfect body for yourself you are beginning right here right now notice how it feels to exert yourself in this way to absorb the energy of the earth the sky and the sun and to propel yourself forward with vitality you are fully alive relish in what this feels like soon the incline decreases in intensity as you approach the highest plateau of the cliff face as your movements slow and require less of your energy you come back to the rhythm of your breath breathing slowly and deeply you take your last few steps towards the highest lookout point of this mountainous terrain from where you stand you can see the shoreline extending for miles and miles and the sea drifting into the horizon the water azure blue by the shore slowly fades into a deep and mysterious darkness you are in awe with the beauty of this landscape as you gaze out across the ocean you realize that anything is possible you see this infinite world of possibility reflected in your own mind and spirit confident in your ability to achieve whatever it is you long for and with your feet grounded in the rich earth beneath you you stand tall and strong fully grounded in this body that carries you through life a deep sense of gratitude for your physical body moves through you and so you thank it for its wisdom support and resilience you take just a few more moments to gaze out across the vast sea below you and as you turn around to find a comfortable place to rest your body you were surprised to find a mirror has appeared from seemingly nowhere it stands on the pathway that leads down to the grassy valley below slowly you make your way towards the mirror mindful step by step and as you reach it your eyes widen at the reflection you see in the mirror it is your perfect self a glimmering you embodying a physical body that makes you feel alive confident and radiant take a moment to scan yourself in the mirror admiring the perfection of your physical form and notice the way you glisten and then deepen your gaze as you focus in on what radiates out from within your confidence your happiness your vitality and aliveness you are supremely beautiful both inside and out just take a few more moments to revel in this radiant image of yourself knowing that this self will move with you even when the mirror is gone you feel confident to step away from it for now and as you pass it by taking the pathway that leads down to the lush green valley below feel a deep sense of self-appreciation warmth and tenderness rise up within you you sense that your mind spirit and body are in full alignment now and so you are ready to rest deeply for a while [Music] your feet carry you to a bright valley and there you find a picnic blanket and a place to rest your head for a while you lower yourself down to the earth resting flat on your back as you gaze up at the blue sky and scattered white clouds thinners cotton above you the sun has disappeared from your view slowly departing for the day to grace another place on this earth hours pass by and soon the sky transforms to orange and purple and then to a deep midnight blue the full moon rises and the stars too and as you gaze up at these planetary neighbors you feel called to set an intention to commit yourself to nourishing and supporting your physical body and all the ways it yearns to be cherished take a moment now to set this intention for your physical appearance and well-being in your words in your mind repeating it to the cosmos three times in silence the stars continue to glisten reflecting the beauty and radiance that is very much alive within you and soon your eyes grow tired your body heavy you scan your body from head to toe letting each body part you pass surrender into the supportive earth and as you close your eyes to the night the visualization of this natural landscape dissipates you come back to the place that holds you by feeling into the supportive surface beneath you just let your entire body relax slowly surrendering completely into sleep you may use your breath as an anchor once again to keep you grounded and present and simultaneously i invite you to allow the following affirmations to fill your consciousness and as they do they will continue to inspire your physical transformation empowering you through positive beliefs so let go of all effort now as you allow your subconscious mind to take these affirmations in i am beautiful confident and radiant my body is healthy and happy i look and feel my best i embody my greatest physique i am in control of my physical well-being i treat my body with love and care every day in every way my body becomes stronger i nourish myself through food and exercise i am empowered to achieve my fitness goals i find joy in

sleep so let us begin by getting comfortable closing your eyes resting your hands just lightly by your side and taking in three deep breaths in through the nose and exhaling through your mouth blowing all the excess air out and feeling the expansion and contraction of your stomach muscles as the air comes in and then leaves your body and bringing your attention now back to your regular breathing nothing forced or strained just find your regular pattern and be a witness to your regular breathing just observe it [Music] during this meditation you may find that your mind may wander and that's simply okay that's a practice of meditation it happens we are thinking beings and all you need to do is not to try to push the thoughts away but rather just bring your focus back to either my voice or to your breathing that helps you get back into the present moment so keep breathing naturally and let go of everything that has happened today and let go of everything that is going to happen or that you think is going to happen tomorrow this is your time now right here right now [Music] [Music] [Music] take a moment to tune into your body and to check how you feel if there are any areas of tension left just visualize the words let go and relax and feel your body responding to that [Music] you feel free from any anxieties feel your body getting heavier you are relaxed it feels perfect so relaxed in fact that your body is beginning to sink down down right down all the way down into the mattress as you get heavier if you have any tension feeling that draining away let everything go and as you do this feel a deep sense of peace well up inside you [Music] throughout this meditation you'll feel the sensation of relaxation and sleepiness just welcome these feelings do not try to fight them just embrace the warm vibe throughout but listen to the sound of my voice as I guide you deeper into this meditation which will ensure powerful feelings of positivity flooding through your body in healing waves and the more you embrace and open up to the sensation of relaxation the more powerful the results will be for you so I would like you to repeat inwardly after me I am ready for peace

feelings I welcome positive sleep mentally repeat these words again and the more you do this the more your body will respond you don't have to say them out loud just visualize yourself repeating and emphasizing the words I am ready for peace I am ready to let go of any internal stresses I am ready to switch off from any external stresses or distractions I am ready for complete freedom from my day I leave behind any negative thoughts or feelings I welcome a positive healing sleep now if you need to get more comfortable do this right now let's dive into this positive healing meditation for sleep

relaxing calming and soothing the soul the portal has a hazy slightly sparkly glazed to it through this portal is the route towards health positive energy and deep refreshing sleep nothing to fee you feel drawn to this portal its energy is merging with yours walk towards it stepping through it easily shimmers with positive energy as you do so now through the other side you emerge in the fading sunlight of what was a glorious day the Sun is still a golden ball sinking lower in the sky and you are standing on a wooden walkway leading out towards the gentle lapping waves of the ocean feel the sensation of the wood beneath your bare feet it is warm and feels just right for you absorb the beauty around you and let it replenish your energy and help to dissipate any self-doubt or concerns walk towards the end of this pathway and sit either cross-legged looking out to the sea or sit with your feet dangling over the edge and feel the waves splashing over your toes breathe in this pure salty air and let go of expectations stress concerns or any inner angst you may add they have no place here this is your time look up into the sky and notice the glorious transformation of colors at first pay attention to the golden and Orange rays from the Sun that shine out across the darkening sky now notice the blue skies as they darken with red and orange colors dabbed as if with artistic fingers transforming the skies and the colors around you you feel bathed in an orange glow she relaxed in this wonderful setting you notice tiny bubbles of thought and energy floating all around you like the scenery they are tinged with golden hues and they represent the various stages of healing and sleep transformation spend a little time focusing on these bubbles as one small bubble floats towards you

1 [Music] sleep well a guided meditation sleep talked down it's time to get comfortable now this meditation is best done lying down and preferably in bed prior to wanting to go to sleep so begin by closing your eyes having your hands placed beside you and taking in three deep breaths breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth really take deep breaths here and letting go of all the tension of the day on the breath out and after you've done this bring your breathing back to its natural rhythm not trying to change your rhythm just being aware of the breath coming in and going out with each breath in fill your body relax and loosen a little bit more and with each breath out feel the tension of the day melting away your body becomes supple and relaxed deeply relaxed [Music] whilst you are beginning to relax know that soon sleep will come you do not need to strive for it to obtain it you just need to listen to my voice as I guide you towards it naturally and without effort if any thoughts come into your mind during this meditation that's perfectly normal it's okay for this to happen we are thinking beings and so we think thousands of thoughts a day what I ask you to do is simply observe the thoughts without attaching to it and in their own time allow them to melt away whilst you focus back on my voice or to your breathing now make sure you are lying comfortably and if not change your position now even just slightly make sure that your body is evenly balanced your hands out to the side and mentally check right now for any tension throughout your body poor posture or day-to-day stresses can make you hold tension in various parts of your body it's time now to just let it all go focusing on your feet move them a little and tense them hold that tension and now let them go shake any tension free just allow them to fall naturally tighten up your ankles and calf muscles then your knees squeeze it all tightly hold and let the tension go really really relaxed this part of your body do the same now for your thighs hips and buttocks tighten then stretch out and release just let go as though this part of your body is just melting through to the floor [Music] now tighten your back and your stomach area tense hold and release all this tension let it go if you feel any tension here that seems to be deeply rooted you can repeat this again now move onto your arms tightening your arms shoulders and neck muscles hold and release let go make sure that your jaw is relaxed let your tongue rest against the roof of your mouth and your lips be open slightly we often carry tension across the scalp and forward to just breathe in and exhale and visualize the muscles relaxing at will and again breathing in and on the breath out see your facial muscles just relax systematically working your way through your body in this enables you to eradicate tension and allows our muscles to relax it enables you to embrace deep sleep as it happens without worrying about it it becomes a routine a positive behavior that leads naturally towards sleep you just have to let go of everyday problems and learn to empty your mind doing this form of meditation practice can help you to let go of everyday problems by focusing on other things and it helps release thoughts old thoughts negative thoughts unwanted thoughts for the day when these thoughts come up simply always keep coming back to my talking or your own breathing if you struggle to stop the bombardment of thoughts infiltrating your mind or find that you constantly try to solve problems the moment you lie down instead turn your attention to your breathing inhale and count the breath in for four seconds hold the breath for four and then exhale for a count of four this can work wonders take a slow deep breath breathe in and feel the breath filling all the way up from the diaphragm and all the way up to the top of the lungs now exhale slowly and feel the diaphragm deflating and tension starting to dissipate now repeat this do this again and this time on the breath out visualizing tension and anxieties leaving your body every time you exhale find me one more time breathe in deep breath in and let it go now imagine yourself standing in a cavern at the top of some ancient steps the steps have been carved into the rock face many years before and although you were inside with the roof of the cavern being too high to reach you feel a cool soothing breeze coming up the steps it's a narrow set of steps but you are longing to know what is at the bottom as you are ready to settle down for the night know that you will be safe as you walk down them and it is a part of your journey towards deep and undisturbed slumber strategically placed torches with golden flickering flames light the way down the steps casting an orange glow this late hour [Music] as you progress down the steps know that you will become more and more relaxed trail your hands down the rocky walls as you progress downwards one step at a time slowly and steadily listen to the sound of my voice but allow the sensations of the moment to filter within visualize the texture of the rock beneath your fingertips feel the slightly warm but textured surface beneath your bare feet you feel a part of nature and a part of history of this place you feel timeless sensations now step down again you feel peaceful you are relaxed and you can let go of any anxieties you may be holding on to step down again you are truly relaxed you feel safe and secure here step down once more notice the blue shimmering light flickering at the foot of the steps intrigued you keep moving downwards you are so relaxed each step takes you nearer to this fluctuating colored light feel relaxed absorb the sense of peace in this place [Music] [Music] as you make your way down to the bottom step and emerge from the cavern you realize that you are now outside at the bottom of a cliff but have emerged in the most beautiful and quiet secret place there is a small pathway ahead of you stepping stones that neatly interlock and guide you towards a platform surrounding by sparkling waters that glisten under the velvet night sky the sound of water trickling over tiny stones is soothing you pause to enjoy these sounds for a few moments [Music] [Music] as you walk along the pathway your feet bear against the warmth of the stones heated by the earlier Sun you see that the platform is small and partially covered at the sides with a pliant willow frame adorned with honeysuckle and jasmine climbing up over filling the air with the subtlest of sense stretching across the platform but looking further out to see a hammock ideally placed for the most relaxing nighttime experience take a moment now to climb into the hammock

1 [Music] [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided sleep meditation this is a meditation that is not only good to help you sleep you may also find it a tool to help with lucid dreaming as this is another way of entering that incredible state between wakefulness and sleep our minds and bodies are like children and the more we ignore their demands the more they demand our attention so if sleep eludes you then you could be possibly ignoring some demand from your body and your mind the solution there for us to pay attention to them but on your own terms not theirs and that can start with this sleep meditation it's based upon yoga nidra which literally means yogic sleep so let's begin and please lie on your back and keep your arms away from your body with your palms facing up allow your legs to naturally fall apart so that they're not touching each other if you're using a pillow make sure it doesn't elevate your head too much so that it restricts your breathing just a nice comfortable place so your back is as straight as possible but not held rigid now I'd like you to close your eyes and pay attention to your breathing inhale exhale inhale exhale your breathing should be as relaxed and as natural as possible with no significant pauses between each inhalation and exhalation now you don't have to make any attempts to keep your breath even your job is to simply breathe as naturally and comfortably as you can and pay attention to each in-breath and each out breath during this meditation you may find your mind wandering and that is normal our minds do wander your job is just to simply gently bring your focus back to your breathing or to my voice let's begin this beautiful process of a an internal mental massage if you like and to bring you into that deep state of yoga nidra so please take a few more breaths and let's begin relax the top of your head now letting go of any tensions you might be feeling there relax your face and all your facial muscles and just bring your mind to your forward and let it smooth itself out relax your eyelids your eyes and the fleshy part around your eye sockets let go and relax now your upper and lower lips but keep them together relax your cheeks from the top of your cheekbone all the way down to your jaw line allow your jaw to sag and let there be a slight gap between your teeth relax the fleshy part beneath your jaw from your chin all the way down to your neck release any tension at the top of your neck and let that feeling spread down to the base of your throat and bring your attention to the back of your neck let it go relax its entire length from the top where it meets your skull all the way down to where your shoulders begin relax your shoulders and let that feeling spread outwards to your shoulder joints the armpits and the space between your shoulder blades let them all sink deeper into your bed relax your upper arms let them become heavier and feel that heaviness seep down to your elbows and into the soft inner flesh opposite your elbows relax your lower arms feel that heaviness seep into your wrists into the back bony part of your hands and into your soft palms just allow that heaviness to fill your knuckles pushing out any tightness discomfort or pain that you might be feeling in them relax your fingers and all the joints of your fingers let your fingers curl or fall wherever they will just allow them to be relax the sides of your chest and let that feeling spread toward the center and relax your solar plexus and let that feeling spread down to your stomach the

run your hand across it noticing the texture in history of the material it is made from when you are ready grasp the door knob or handle and pull it open revealing a staircase behind the door [Music]

go of any cares and responsibilities as you breathe deeply watching the sunlight meander back and forth and trees sway in the breeze bring your attention back to yourself where our pain and tension

to gain a new and inspiring sense of perspective feel yourself begin to float gently out of the marble seat you move up even higher twisting your position around so that you can look around as you float higher you float up above the marble walls and now you can see the view of the city around you lights the twinkle far beneath the expanse of sky the view is magnificent you can see for miles the landscape lit by twinkling lights heralding the existence of those who live and share this reality with you a cityscape that comes to life with the sprinkling of artificial lights that mirror the heavens above you move effortlessly relishing in this feeling of freedom here you are cast afloat from the problems of daily life it is like flying but with no effort required a single thought enables you to change direction at will and you travel on you look down moonlight is reflected in the rippling waters of the estuary gentle waves lap at the shore and as you float out further high above the darkened waters boats Bob along the harbour walls and the feeling here is of complete peace and tranquility you feel invisible there is no blame here no regrets just or at being able to see life from a whole new perspective traveling over the estuary you head along the coastline scaling large cliffs flying high above them thin wispy clouds almost transparent from below are blown in from the sea hugging the cliffs as you move higher the clouds wrap themselves around you like gossamer threads the clouds wispy fragile and translucent follow in your trail as you saw ever higher rising vertically now higher and higher looking up towards the moon silvery gray the moon is for you marvel at its beauty and power knowing how it controls the ebb and wane of the tides he is suddenly life seems less complicated there is a sense of pureness of mystery and yet clarity life is good life is wonderful and you share a sense of connection with the universe breathing deeply and then release the breath letting go of any tension within your body instead focus on the softness of every muscle feel yourself loose relaxed and free from burden far below you low flying birds hug the surface of the water disturbed they seem tiny and fast moving the water ripples gently sparkling stars and the light from the moon Herald your way you see the world from an enlightened viewpoint and it is one of wonder here high above the fragmented clouds you feel a part of the world's mystery connected on every level and free from your problems you can sense a change around you gradually the air becomes warmer and misted as cloud formations begin to forge together the sky changes color dark muted through to light and for a while the Sun and Moon share a place in the heavens he dropped down now through the fluffy clouds thicker now and float down towards the Earth's surface you feel exalted as the see now mirrors the changing skies sparkling sunlight glinting across the surface and shimmers of blue you drift down moving on away from the water's edges still high above the city's architecture tall concrete pillars and homes reaching up towards the sky and small private residences alone surrounded by small patches of green like a complex jigsaw of life stone and irregular shapes all fitting together in an almost seamless ease marvel at how the man-made structures can look beautiful too here you can see that life is about living and not holding on to problems there is no place in your life anymore for anxieties that make you feel ill tension headaches regrets that nor away that cue or the decisions that you just can't make here in this weightless existence you realize that you can be free from all of the negative aspects of life no longer shackled by an existence that holds you back this acknowledgement is meaningful it has the power to change your life as you breathing deeply conjure up the image of those problems and all of the boxes that you left behind initially they were overflowing threatening in their power to hamper your life to impact you at every turn now picture them reduced in size no more threatening just minor inconveniences now that you have scaled them in your mind shrink the problems smaller still breathe deeply again and then out breathing out the last of your connections to those problems and visualize them growing ever smaller minut a fraction of their former size and you realize that your perspective was clouded before your judgement of center your realization of the truth in life and the importance of nature and your place in the world makes those problems seem insignificant by comparison [Music] focus again on your breathing inhaling as you open up the chest exhaling as you breathe out it is time to see the problems of life as mere obstacles it is time to look to the important things in life and to step away from any doubts regrets or anxieties that affect you negatively it is time to feel contentment and to embrace pure inner peace drift gently now down to earth close your eyes and feel your descent you are at peace with life and with yourself finally you understand your part within the universe drifting down bathed in golden light as the Sun shimmers in the early morning sky the faint warmth is comforting a beautiful start to the day it is time to feel positive about your life you have the power to do so you are centered you retain the feeling of peace and wonder you are now back in your own reality imagine that you are back in your bed comfortable safe and secure open your eyes and stretch out your muscles breathing deeply to send oxygen around your body realize how good you feel right now keep experiencing the wonderful sense of calmness and deep peace as you remember your wonderful high time above the clouds a part of the midnight sky and then a part of the early morning transition as night became day understand now that your problems are such a small part of time and space and even within your own reality understand that your problems can be dealt with quickly and clearly with clarity of mind breathing deeply and keep your sense of peace and tranquility breathe out slowly noting that no tension remains remember that you can return to this meditation whenever you need a renewed perspective you are one with the universe [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to wisely let go of any anger you might be experiencing before sleep when held onto anger can inhibit us from feeling into our innate sense of peace and our capacity for compassion and so by becoming mindful of this emotion and addressing it thoughtfully we can loosen its grip and uncover a new way forward so to begin this bedtime meditation take your time to get settled in for the night ensure that your spine is long and straight and your neck becoming an extension of it and then allow your limbs to relax and fall however they are comfortable close your eyes as you turn your attention inwards and then note what it feels like to be held by the surface beneath you what does it feel like to be tethered by the weight of gravity what does the mattress or other surface beneath you feel like against your skin without judging your experience see if you can simply become more intimate with the physical space you rest in and once you feel grounded and completely connected to the physical world i invite you to shift your attention to the air around you you might notice the sensation of it against your cheeks or you might observe the way it slowly enters and exits the body as your breath as each breath fills you you're provided with life-supporting oxygen offered to us by the plant kingdom and with each breath out we return this gift to the plant life in the form of carbon dioxide spend a few moments with your breath now noting how effortless this exchange this flow is see if you can allow the chest the shoulders and the belly to soften facilitating the flow of the breath and perhaps inviting it a little bit deeper now as we dive into this process of releasing the energy of anger it is worthwhile to begin by softening out judgments of this emotion in and of itself anger is neither good nor bad it is simply a reaction we experience to various circumstances or events in our life what we do with our anger is another thing when left to fest inside or when released mindlessly upon those around us anger can hurt more than it heals however we can also choose to use anger as a signpost for what we value for the direction we wish to move in our lives only when we begin by softening our judgment and opening to this experience with more care and curiosity do we enable ourselves to discover a new way forward so right now i invite you to take a moment to draw your attention to your heart space the center of your chest and as you breathe envision the heart expanding energetically with each breath in and softening its toughest barriers with each breath out with each breath that moves through the heart imagine your judgments of this emotion relaxing as you create more space for it to unravel in a healing and a cleansing way if stories about rightness or wrongness come to mind simply note these as they appear and then release with an out breath for example if we notice ourselves feeling righteous or holding on to the wrong doings of another we might invite these to soften if only just for a moment and this does not mean you'll not be called to take certain wise action in daily life but for now harboring the energy of this anger is likely of little benefit so continue to come back to the breath again and again as needed expanding as you inhale and softening or releasing as you exhale before we move into the visualization that will help us to cleanse any held anger for the coming night i invite you to mindfully inquire into the energy that lives beneath your anger the energy that this anger arises from sometimes our anger comes from the mind as a yearning to be right or as a defensive reaction other times it arises from our values from care and concern about someone or something and even sometimes it's a mix of these two things a blend of mental and intuitive responses to the world around us so i invite you to take a few moments to compassionately curiously and non-judgmentally inquire into the energies beneath or behind the raw experience of anger and just hold yourself gently as you explore this noting to what extent you might be reacting in defense and to what extent this emotion may be rising out of love when you awaken into another day you can use this self-knowledge to help you navigate your anger in a way that is conducive of deep healing on an individual and collective level but for now let's take some time to just let it all go to reaffirm that in this moment we are well that in this moment we can best serve ourselves by inviting our anger to dissolve so take a moment now to come back to your breath for a few cycles use the breath or the body as an anchor for your attention any time you find your mind wandering that does not serve you in this moment just bring it back focusing back on your breathing and once you feel centered i invite you to bring your attention to the creative capacity of your mind and in this space begin to visualize that you are in the midst of an autumn forest surrounded by trees with leaves turning amber mahogany gold and crimson the forest floor beneath your feet is a path of densely packed earth a thin layer of early autumn leaves lays sparse signifying that the turn of seasons is upon you the air is cool but you are dressed warmly for the evening the sky is still a pale blue but you can tell by the glimmer in the trees that the sun will be setting soon before making your way along the path that leads you through the woods you take a moment to plant your feet into the earth reaching the top of your head towards the sky above your heart opens your shoulders relax you take a few long slow deep breaths to ground yourself into this calm and soothing forest you allow your forehead to soften your jaw to unclench your belly to relax and all unnecessary tension to soften and following your next breath out you decide to move forward to venture deeper into the transitioning woods you have arrived in step by step you move along the pathway that guides you through the colorful enchanting landscape the air is crisp and earthy cleansing you with each breath that moves through you small forest critters scurry across the earth and and birds chirp from their cozy nests snuggled in the trees as you admire the harmony of life here in the woods you feel yourself surrendering to it opening up to this moment exactly as it is any weight you've been carrying upon your shoulders begins to lighten guided by the energy of the falling leaves any judgments frustrations concerns or worries that you've been harboring also find their place in the forest dissolving from within your body as you harmonize with the environment around you the woods are at peace inviting you to find that tranquil space within yourself as well though the forest is not immune to the challenges of life but now it embraces the harmonious transition from day into night you carry on just a short while before the forest begins to thin and as it does your jaw drops at the radiant beauty that emerges glimmering back into your eyes a silent still pristine lake surrounded by the vibrant foliage of the forest comes into view treading lightly towards the water's edge you find a sandy stretch of shoreline and allow yourself to take a seat from where you rest you admire the reflection of the trees and the still surface of the lake the perfect mirror image softens your heart calling you deeper into the mystery of the world the reflection reminds you that we are all mirrors to one another that everything we face has something to show us about ourselves or about the nature of the world see if you can feel your mind softening as you reflect upon this sinking into the silence that holds it all and now as you sit here by the lake you hold yourself and the world in a full embrace without desiring to change anything about this simple moment see if you can open yourself completely to what is the frustrations the judgments anger that you've experienced as being a part of the world now begin to feel distant here amidst the autumn trees and silent lake you are granted with the time and space required for you to process all of those inner energies you trust that as you process them new possibilities for more wise and loving steps to take in days to come will present themselves to you as you gaze out across the water you realize there is nothing that needs to be done in this moment but to continue allowing yourself to surrender and so you lean back allowing your full body to nestle into the sandy shore beneath you feel yourself fully supported here on this small beach by the lake as the sun seeps behind the tree line the orange pink glow of the night radiates throughout the cosmos bringing a warmth to your being and as you rest here you take a moment to inquire with your body about any areas of tension or residual anger that may be longing for your attention drawing your awareness to the crown of your head to begin you slowly scan the body downwards consciously relaxing or inviting a loving breath into each area you pass when you're finished tending to the entire body come back to your breath filling yourself with cleansing crisp air of the surrounding woods that hold you your inner eye is still open to the night sky you watch as the colors deepen soon transitioning into a dark and deep purple the crescent moon appears as do thousands upon thousands of shimmering stars with your entire body relaxed breathe mindfully through the heart space inviting the universal energy of love to fill you on your next breath in and offering your inner love back to the universe on your next breath out and as you gaze up to the night sky take a moment to offer a few silent loving words to yourself grant yourself permission to feel as you feel while bathing yourself in words of love and patience and care and kindness [Music] now i invite you to repeat the same for someone or something that may have stirred anger within you in recent days and note that this doesn't mean that you need to make right the actions of another it is simply an invitation to where possible send love and care and patience to that which sparks anger within us when you are finished come back to your breath noting how it causes your body to rise and fall as you rest in the silence of this night let all thoughts and all images within the mind dissolve now there is nothing else that needs to be done slowly your eyes begin to close to the cosmos above you and the lake before you your mind's eye becomes clear and you feel your body once again tethered to the physical reality you rest in you take three long slow deep breaths releasing with the sigh as you exhale and when you are finished with those three breaths just allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and as you move deeper into the night you let yourself go completely getting the past and releasing the future all that matters now is this present moment as well as the energies of love and care curiosity and tenderness and so you allow yourself to be here to be bathed in these soothing energies as you drift into the restful slumber that awaits good night my friend so so hmm hmm [Music] so um hmm hmm so foreign so um hmm um so hmm so foreign hmm [Music] hmm

moment and enjoy the way the tide pulls it water undulating past your skin let the sea wash through the hair at the nape of your neck erasing any tension you hold there feel the way your body Bob's up and down slightly as you pass through small soothing waves allow your eyes to drift upwards and notice how the Sun is beginning to set the sky is beginning to turn color scarlet streaks appearing against bright blue as you watch daytime sky begins to fade giving way to a brilliant mixture of pinks reds and oranges the Sun begins to drift below the horizon a regal sphere returning to its own place of rest as it sinks lower inky blue joins the brighter colors soothing and calm while you continue breathing you notice that although the Sun has gone down the ocean around you remains warm and gentle rocking you gently across its surface in fact the darkness around you leaves you free to enjoy the relaxation and aimlessness the water brings instead of noticing the science around you you focus on the sensations in your limbs let yourself drift further if any thoughts or ideas come up allow the current around you to wash them off observe them without worrying as you drift further and further into the distance let the concerns you leave behind relax to notice the way they sink into the warm comfort of this tropical sea you are cleansed of thoughts of worries of tensions now you

moving on to a nearby flower feel the soil underneath your back smell the flowers the grass the dirt all around you see yourself looking upwards watching the clouds move across the sky they to calm you loving your body into an even deeper tranquility if you can imagine your body falling asleep in this mirror growing heavier more relaxed your spirit may not want to sleep yet and that is okay perhaps you want to envision your spirits standing back up even as your imaginary body falls into a deep and restful stillness [Music] and now let your body slumber for a little while as your spirit continues its journey into relaxation your body will rest right here entirely safe entirely secure until you are ready to return to it no harm will come to you during this meditation with this in mind turn your eyes to the horizon at the edge of the meadow you can see a leafy green band of trees standing Sentinel the majestic guardians of this sacred space in your heart you know that there is a tree there's that is taller and larger than the others far more ancient than those that grow around it you feel inexplicably drawn toward it connected at a deep and spiritually significant level you begin to walk towards the edge of this meadow allow yourself to move towards the forest following the path that appears at your feet and leads into the trees as you approach they grow taller and taller in your vision beginning as the size of your smallest finger in the distance but soon towering over your head with a calm wisdom that permeates your entire being as you step under the canopy you feel any stress or strain you're carrying begin to loosen falling away in the same way dried leaves fall from the boughs of the maple in autumn everything you let go of drifts away disappearing already decomposing into the soil that will nurture the trees here for years to come [Music] the sunshine here is less bright dappled and soft instead of its usual brash gold the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to and yet it is a soothing coolness filled with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss all around you stand the trunks of trees and saplings some tall and smooth others old and knild there are younger trees too skinny and gangly as they grow towards sunlight let yourself sense the slow determination of these trees anchored by roots as long as the tree is tall the trees are content to simply be here calm and strong against the weather they welcome you into their presence greet you as one just as ancient and wise as they are [Music] [Music] as you breathe deeply watching the sunlight meander back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze bring your attention back to your spiritual self the tree sense that there is something you still carry with you a mental or emotional weight that troubles you even in this place it is safe to understand it here perhaps you are mourning the end of a relationship or struggling with a relationship that exists now maybe you are tired after a long journey toward a still unreached goal perhaps you worry about money or health either for yourself or for someone else you might carry guilt or regret bitterness or perhaps even hatred [Music] whatever appears does not make you evil but is a sign of yourself outgrowing something that once used to fit there's no need to judge yourself here but instead calmly regard whatever appears in your mind and spirit [Music] let whatever this may be surface within you and when you have looked at it from every angle imagine as a handful of mud materializing in your hands as you look at it a breeze appears drying it out turning it to dust blowing it away from you into the trees your palms are clean and no trace remains of this worry or concern in your heart [Music] feel the way the sunlight darts about moving with the fluttering leaves but also heeling wherever your soul may be hurting first the wind cleansed you of any emotional pain and now allow the Sun to heal you whatever may be aching [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you continue your walk down the path hearing the distant chatter of squirrels and the occasional chirp of birds the path leads you onwards as you take in the sounds sights and smells of the forest drawing you onward until you reach the oldest tree in the forest this particular tree has a trunk so large that a cave has been carved out within the middle of it a perfect place for quiet reflection and contemplation its bark is smooth with a goldish sheen and far far overhead the leaves dance in the breeze with an almost silvery tint this tree is tall taller than any of the others taller than the tallest building you have ever seen you sense its benevolence the warmth with which it welcomes you invite you into its magnificent cave deep within the girth of its trunk except its invitation you begin to enter the cave knowing you are completely safe although it's somewhat dark there are lit candles within already illuminating the inside of this ancient tree your soul grows light or with each step as the cool darkness of the woods gives way again to the healing candle light within the cave helping you to relax deeper almost instantly you feel calm wiser and safe you feel an old familiar feeling a serenity that you have not had for such a long while from the cave you can see out to the entire forest witnessing the bobbing leaves of the other trees nearby and a squirrel scampering about far off in the distance a brightly colored swath of grass and flowers catches your eye it is the meadow and you can see your physical body resting totally and completely on this blissful summer's day allow yourself to enjoy the tranquility of the cave and the view of the forest feel a breeze into the cave and ruffle your hair and watch the Magnificent scenery around you from this position you can understand and see anything you like stay here peaceful tranquil for as long as you like and if you would like allow your spirit journey back through the forest and back to the meadow where you sink down beside your physical body a washing piece and restful contentment [Music]

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this back to basics guided meditation for beginners in the next few minutes your delve into meditation with me as your guide this recording is designed for anyone new to meditation but it also provides an opportunity for anyone to return to basics and rediscover the heart of their practice many of us have a very fixed idea of what meditation is perhaps you may see someone sitting cross-legged on a pillow and chanting or even refusing to speak for days at a time although these techniques and practices can deepen your understanding of yourself and the world around you they do not necessarily define meditation but simply meditating is becoming attuned to yourself finding peace and stillness in the midst of a hectic world it's an intensely personal experience and soon you will find yourself developing habits and preferences for your own practice for right now though allow yourself to release all of your expectations for what you will encounter in the next few minutes and open yourself to a world of infinite possibilities when you are quiet and contemplative any mystery can reveal itself to you [Music] we will begin by relaxing if you have not already situate yourself in a natural relaxed position many people like to meditate seated in a comfortable straight back chair feet firmly resting on the ground with hands placed gently in the lap you may prefer a different position perhaps you would like to try listening to this recording laying down or with your feet crossed whatever you do find a comfortable posture and let your eyes drift closed fill your ribs and belly as you breathe savor the heaviness in your limbs as they relax letting gravity hold you in its gentle embrace you can feel every fiber of your body soften relax and release now as we continue through this meditation let everything be effortless and easy continuation of your physical presence give yourself permission now to stop planning expecting and reacting just for a little while just be brave in [Music] and exhale as you breathe you will begin to notice areas in your body that feel tense or uncomfortable on your next breath in imagine your breath as a white light or cool breeze feel its surge through your body touching the places where you carry tension or pain then as you exhale this tension follows your breath out of your body leaving you more relaxed than before [Music] take another deep breath in and sigh it out feel your shoulders softening the corners of your eyes smoothie and your belly relaxing [Music] with your eyes closed the world outside may seem sharper notice this and then direct your attention back towards yourself notice you're breathing without trying to change our daily routines are busy and we spend much of our lives focused on things outside of ourselves deadlines tasks and other people's reactions can fill our consciousness leaving us no room to be still and peaceful bringing your attention to your breath is one of the fastest and simplest methods to bring you into sync with the present moment if thoughts or concerns from your day crop up acknowledge their presence and let them pass you by when you emerge from this meditation you will remember everything you need to do so there is no need to grab on to any thought right now this is your time to be light and relaxed free from the demands of daily life allow your breath to be your focus as you slip into a deeper state of peace and comfort [Music] some Meditation Center on imagining certain scenarios or sensations when you feel ready you can pursue them but just for right now allow your own feelings to rise up inside you be attentive and listen to what your body mind and spirit are trying to show you paradoxically letting go of all expectations is what will bring you a deep sense of stillness and open you to your own inner wisdom [Music] breathe in and out let your whole be exist in the present [Music] with every inhale you sink deeper into a state of relaxation and stillness this is the heart of of meditation [Music] give yourself a moment to recognize the feelings within you and then return to your breath [Music] listen to the rhythm of your breath and the sounds of the world around you observe them with detachment letting thoughts and sensations flow through you as easily as water runs over pebbles feel a deep sense of calm and develop you in the next few moments allow yourself to simply be in this space [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] begin to bring your awareness back what do you feel right now

1 [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to this healing space guided meditation over the course of the next few minutes we will travel together into contemplative silence and then open the doors to any feelings you may be holding inside yourself offering them a safe way to emerge and be released as we begin make yourself comfortable settle in and begin to listen to the rhythm of your own breath allow the music to carry you deeper as you begin this journey into your own mind and spirit [Music] [Music] begin to let go of the thoughts that appear in your mind jockeying for attention they are bright and exciting but they will lead you off the path of relaxation and into the arena of problem-solving you spend so much of your waking life problem-solving like a matador against a never-ending series of balls he do not need to do this now this is your chance to be quiet soft tranquil as you feel your breath flowing through your lungs oxygen transported through your body by your blood let your breath flow through you dissolve any energy blockage or muscle tension it encounters along the way [Music] [Music] [Music] as you find yourself relaxing more deeply muscles softening and bones resting easily let your mind's eye open and your imagination take flight on your next deep exhale you are sitting beside a river legs crossed and hands resting on your knees palms up it is night here and the sky and the water of varying depths of black despite this you know that you are absolutely safe here and that as long as you continue breathing and listening to this meditation nothing bad can happen to you so take this opportunity to follow your breath even more closely feeling every minuscule change in your lungs as you inhale and exhale [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as thoughts come up look them in the eye smile and give them permission to leave you they bow to you and promise that if you need to speak with them again they can be caught up at a moment's notice they do not want to disturb you during this time for you so allow yourself the freedom to tend to them later this space is a space for your healing and total surrender to relaxation and awareness embrace it now [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] and now bring your mind's eye back to the night around you the dark water ahead of you feel how there is no danger nearby as you are protected by your own subconscious mind and the benevolence of the world surrounding you you are absolutely safe with this in mind let your imaginary eyes adjust a little further into the darkness and begin to notice the variations in the night the places where some of the deep blue or black a lighter than others embrace the silence and feel the tranquility that comes with it in this space your hands rest on your knees palm up they are receptive to whatever emotions arise in yourself a feeling good or bad appears in your heart and as it does you begin to notice a paper lantern hovering just above your palms growing slowly less translucent as you become more familiar with the emotion within you let whatever you feel fill your consciousness passing through you and into the lantern without judgment or fear feel fully but let yourself feel without thinking allowing the emotion to be within you but not about you Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] there is a candle nestled within this Lantern and as you allow this emotion to flow through you a small flame appears with your every breath it grows a bit stronger until a cheerful tongue of flame illuminates the paper that shelters it from the wind no matter how an emotion affects you it is beautiful and unique just as this lantern is exquisite in its simplicity take a moment to say thank you to the wisdom this feeling has brought you as you carried it along your daily journey these past weeks or years feel gratitude for it slight well-up in your chest a warmth radiating from your heart outwards and then when you are ready whisper goodbye as the lantern begins to lift away from your palms it floats higher bobbing gently in the breeze as it floats upwards stopping high above your head its candle flame is golden against the inky night sky the light rippling on the surface of the water admire it for a moment and then return to your hands as another lantern perhaps a different color or pattern begins to materialize just above them feel the emotions run through you and when you are ready release this lantern and any others that follow it into the sky watching a constellation of candle lights appearing in the sky and the rivers reflection you are surrounded by lights [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] look at all the lanterns all around you the lights that flicker in the sky and the water with the golden warmth these are the feelings that you have carried with you the emotions that have taught you much but are no longer useful on your journey they are magnificent but they are temporary and you may let them go take a moment to thank them again for their presence and their guidance and when you are ready sigh out your breath in a long slow wash as you do so the lanterns Bob gently and begin to float upwards lights growing smaller and smaller until they are like tiny pinpricks in the sky one by one they disappear from view carried far out into space to dance with the Stars you are free [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] you [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] and now slowly begin to bring yourself back to your physical body calling your spirit back with compassion you have undergone significant healing in the past few minutes so be gentle with yourself as you continue your daily journeys when you are ready let your eyes drift open and smile you are light you are free and you will discover exactly what you need [Music] you you [Music] you
1 it has been said that one hour of yoga nidra equates to four hours of deep sleep because we go through all of the brainwave stages you typically go through during sleep only in a compressed amount of time using this systematic approach to full body and mind relaxation can help you connect with your own true and natural wisdom your ability for healing and relieving stress if you are feeling stressed this practice can be just what you need to experience inner peace and joy it is also a great way to help you fall asleep and sleep deeply if you practice before bed get ready to heal and restore your body quiet your mind and bring compassion and love into your heart hello and welcome I'm Sara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are on Oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing before you begin to settle into your comfortable yoga nidra posture it is important for you to set a specific intention or personal resolve for the practice so you can commit to it at the start let it sink into your subconscious during and revisit it when the practice is coming to a close this intention is called a San culpa this San culpa can help you make a positive change in your life as your brain enters delta-wave frequencies where you are very receptive to change for your San culpa choose something that aligns with your deepest desires this statement is positive in nature and is in the present tense you may choose to start the statement using the words I am as you are solidifying your intention feel it in your heart as if it is true perhaps imagine what your life might be like when it is true you can keep the same San culpa for as long as you like and come back to this practice frequently to send a consistent message to your subconscious feel free to pause this recording to take time to set your intention maybe write it down on a small piece of paper to keep with you after your practice is complete now I would like to take a brief moment to give you some suggestions for your setup as it is important to be extremely comfortable and feel safe in the position you choose for your yoga nidra practice you can choose to lie down on the floor or in your bed for this practice you will want to be fully supported the intent is not to go to sleep it is to relax your body fully so you can relax your mind and let go of stress you may choose to have your head and shoulders slightly elevated to make sure you stay awake you can use a yoga bolster a pillow a rolled blanket or towel under your knees to make sure there is no strain in your lower back you may like a pillow or a blanket under your head as well and I recommend covering up with a blanket as your body temperature will drop as you become more and more relaxed and finally if you like you can cover your eyes with a washcloth or eye pillow now I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes if you like and settle into comfort [Music] let your body sink into the surface below you make any shifts in your body to let yourself settle deeper into the support you can be comforted to know that at this time there is nowhere to go nothing to do everything is okay you have set aside this time to simply feel your body and listen come into stillness now for deep rest and deep nourishment do not worry if you don't hear everything I say it is natural to flow in and out of consciousness the deepest part of you is listening bring your attention to your environment around you listen to the farthest sound outside the room listen to the closest sounds inside the room allow yourself a moment to become aware of anything else you can sense any smells anything you can see inside your closed eyelids or perhaps the temperature of the air around you allow your attention to move inward for a moment and discover a safe place within a place where you feel secure and loved this may be a feeling within your body or a visualization of an actual place where you feel safe know that you may return your attention to this place anytime you need it now in your mind remember your intention or San culpa and stated three times feel it in your heart and body as if it is true now letting your San culpa go for now visualize your own body resting and become aware of your own physical presence [Music] allow the weight of your body and your bones to become heavy [Music] feel your bones sinking into the support allow your awareness to follow the sound of my voice and travel through your body now on a journey of sensation simply feel each part as it is mentioned as you remain still and relax deeper welcome all sensations you experience just as they are begin by noticing where your head meets the support below you allow your head to feel heavy and supported resting fully allow your face to relax letting go of any facial expressions to soften anywhere you can now in your mind you can let your awareness visit the areas in your body as you hear them moving your awareness to your face sensing your mouth feel your mouth feel sensations inside of your mouth notice your jaw lips and where your upper lip touches your lower lip since the inside of your mouth your teeth gums and your tongue feel the inside of your cheeks feel all of your face now as a whole inviting yourself to relax deeper and deeper in your mind find your right hand no need to move simply sense where it is notice your entire right hand your right thumb first finger middle finger ring finger and pinkie finger since your right palm the back of your hand your wrists lower arm elbow and upper arm since your right shoulder now bring your attention down to your right hip thigh knee lower leg and ankle since the top of your right foot your big toe second toe

your foot your heel and since your entire foot since your abdomen now relaxing your belly as well as your lower back notice any tension here dissolving away from your abdomen back and hips bring your awareness to your neck and throat as you soften here relax your jaw letting your teeth part and softening the area of the corners of your mouth noticing your tongue relaxing inside your mouth since your right eye eyelid and eye socket relax completely and your left eye eyelid and eye socket [Music] since both eyes together noticing a softening notice your right ear inner and outer ear and your left ear inner and outer ear and both ears together and since your entire head and face as a whole to relax completely invite any remaining holding or tension to let go from anywhere in your body bring your awareness now to your breath since your natural breath as it flows through you feel the in-breath and the out-breath notice your breathing as it comes and goes noticing your breath you can relax further if you wish remember this is a time to consciously relax remind yourself to stay awake and alert yet relaxed watch your breath closely without manipulating it simply experience your breath since it feel it follow it attach no judgment to it simply experience your breath fully since the sound of your breath allowing this to be the object of your attention to relax your mind and body further the soft subtle sound is the breath of life when your mind wanders during this practice bring your attention back to the feeling of your breath feel your breath entering into your body through your nostrils follow the path of your breath as it moves into your chest and abdomen and follow the path as your breath moves back out through your nostrils you may feel enlivened by the inhale and relaxed by the exhale feel each breath as energy moving through you inhale with a sense of energetic expansion or inspiration exhale with a sense of letting go of tension letting go of any need to hold on or control because you can let go with every exhale you can make room you can more clearly focus on what's important to you you may notice with the attention on your breath it is slowed down it has relaxed you like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down with every breath you may sense more space between your breaths as well as more space between your thoughts as you inhale and exhale you may imagine a wave passing upward and downward throughout your body carrying away tensions bringing a sense of calm to every cell inside your body now scan through your internal sensations to observe what is there for you right now with acceptance as if you are offering permission to your experience rather than judgment start with your physical experience do you feel a sensation of floating or lightness do you feel other areas of sinking or heaviness can you sense these opposites at the same time light and heavy coexisting scan through your body to notice any areas that feel comfortable and any areas that might feel uncomfortable [Music] noticing back and forth between the two sensations and since areas of comfort and discomfort at the same time coexisting [Music] become aware of your emotions now since the physical feelings of your emotions and where in your body you may experience them scan through your body for the physical sensations that are associated with emotions notice with curiosity and acceptance experience your emotions just as they are looking inward for what you're feeling right now is there contentment or peace or do you sense agitation do you perhaps sense both peace and agitation at the same time what are other qualities you are aware of when you quietly observe look inward not inwards or labels but in sensations and feelings without judgment when you acknowledge and accept these emotions you can allow the energy to move through you these sensations and the awareness of the sensations the listening inward allows you to connect with your body in your heart experience the emotion and the physical sensations rather than think of this emotion and the stories that are associated with it open to all of it awakening to the full experience of life as a balance of sweet and sadness comfort and discomfort blissful moments as well as difficulties when you connect with and sit with this energy it doesn't have to rule you as it moves through you this energy can awaken you to the full experience of life let go of the fear of the emotion and allow it to awaken you let go of the tendency for avoidance of emotion and lean into it as a message from within [Music] as you continue this relaxed inward awareness become aware of any thoughts arising witness them as if you are witnessing a flowing river of thoughts see them surface flow by and disappear each breath cycle naturally Rises and is released similarly our thoughts rise and are then released let this idea this knowledge be a comfort to you to allow your thoughts to drift down the flowing river of thoughts as you observe them you may find it helpful to name these thoughts as they arise identify them as a way to simply be aware of thinking after they have been named witness them as one drop of water in the flowing river of thoughts moving with each of the other thoughts rising and falling and flowing away like your breath rising and falling away your thoughts to rise and fall away no matter how many thoughts come up allow them to flow by if you find yourself following a thought or reacting to a thought bring your attention back to the sensations of your breath if we resist the current of the flowing river of thoughts it will continue to rush against us pushing an opposition perhaps giving you the feeling of being stuck if we accept it allow it we drift effortlessly along with the current the awareness of your thoughts allows you to let go of the hold they may have on you continue noticing your thoughts as they arise and allow them to fall away you may even notice your thoughts coming with more space between them when you practice allowing them to rise and fall as with each cycle of breath if you find you get swept up with a thought with compassion for yourself and patience bring your awareness back to your breath [Music] allow yourself to go further still into relaxation since a safe place inside you a place where you feel secure and loved since the place where your inner joy that you were born with is within you remaining as relaxed and calm as you can invite your imagination to call to mind a person a friend or loved one that makes you smile simply by thinking of them this person is someone that is easy to love your love for this person flows naturally perhaps this individual brings you joy allow the image and the energy of this person to rest within your heart make space for the image or the energy of this person to stay within you perhaps imagine your heart expanding with love that you feel for this person see and feel joy and happiness from this person perhaps do you think of a specific experience or just the nature of this individual feel their joy their happiness if at any point you find your mind wandering let the feeling of joy and happiness bring your attention back and now imagine sharing their joy imagine lifting each other up supporting each other and experiencing joy together since this joy not only in your heart but throughout your entire body connect with this loved ones joy and positive energy as if it is intertwining with your own as you continue to stay with the sensations of joy and happiness in your heart you can repeat the following phrases in your mind or simply send positive energy to that individual that brings you joy may you appreciate the joy in your life may your joy continue and grow may you live with joy and gratitude always [Music] may you appreciate the joy in your life may your joy continue and grow may you live with joy and gratitude always let go of these memories and sense that joy is still within you it is always present and you can call upon it anytime you wish now allow yourself to go deeper still allow all of the thoughts to go let your scanning awareness drift off simply be present with your truest self letting all the layers of yourself dissolve let what seems like boundaries blur since a place inside of you that is the place of your inner wisdom your intuition your truest self here inside you is where your present awareness and insights reside when you pause and simply be your mind stops and you open into expansiveness open into spaciousness [Music] take a moment now to open yourself up and be receptive to whatever you find here open to any messages that arise during this introspective time [Music] [Music] now remember your San culpa bring your intention back to mind repeat your San culpa in your mind several times feel it in your heart planting the seed to grow as you begin to transition out of yoga nidra begin to move your awareness outward again becoming aware of your breath follow your breath awaken gradually with each passing breath become aware of your heart and breathe into this space let the energy of your heart move outward and awaken you as you become more and more aware become aware of the room around you perhaps you notice the sounds around you listening to your environment in your own time begin to move away from your practice moving and stretching your body in any way that feels good to you waking up your body your mind and your heart to go on with your day with your intention and mind when you are ready open your eyes thank you for practicing with me today come back to this practice as often as you need enjoying the benefits equivalent to four hours of deep sleep I hope you have a wonderful day
1 Hello my loves, welcome to a guided sleep meditation by Lavendaire. This meditation will help you relax your body and your mind, preparing you for a peaceful, deep sleep. We will start in a seated posture, and then move onto a lying posture later on. Please find a comfortable seated position on your bed. It might help to add a pillow under you for support. ... Rest your hands on your knees, with your palms facing up. Close your eyes. Take a moment to feel your body, and feel the natural flow of your breath. ... Regardless of what happened in your day, it is time to let it go. Release your day, release all the worries, release all the stress. You don't need it anymore. We'll take 5 deep breaths, with an open mouth exhale. When you inhale, think of peace. When you exhale, let go of any tension that you may be holding onto, both in your body and in your mind. With each exhale, find a deeper & deeper level of release. Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling up the space in the bottom of your belly... Then a deep exhale out through your mouth, releasing all the worries and tension from your day. Take another deep breath in through your nose, breathing in peace, And a big exhale out through your mouth, exhaling all the stress... Deep inhale through your nose, let the air reach deep into your belly... And a deep exhale out through your mouth, letting go... Another deep inhale through your nose, Exhale and let it all out... feel your body soften & relax... Final deep breathe in... inviting peace... And exhale... drop your shoulders and release... Become aware of how your body feels now. And how your breath grows slower and deeper as you relax. .... The mind and body are one. When our mind relaxes, our body relaxes, and vice versa. When we feel stress or anxiety, our bodies hold onto these emotions as physical tension, and it makes it harder for us to relax and sleep well. Every night, make time to clear your mind and relax your body. This is your time to love and nurture your mind, body, and soul. Now, we will do some gentle stretches to further relax the body. Let's start with some neck stretches. Take a deep breath in… And on your exhale, bring your chin down to stretch the back of your neck. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your hands behind your head. Hold here for two full breaths, breathing through the tension with each exhale. On your next exhale bring your chin to neutral and face forward. Onto side neck stretches. Gently tilt your head to the right, and hold for three deep breaths. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your right hand on your head… Reset on your 3rd breath. Now do the opposite side. Tilt your head slowly to the left, and hold for three deep breaths.... Reset on your next exhale… Now let's do a couple neck circles on each side.. While inhaling, slowly roll your head to the right, back, then exhale to the left, and then down… gently at your own pace, do one more round…inhaling for the first half, exhaling for the 2nd half..... Now switch directions. Slowly circle your neck the other way, inhaling to the left, back, exhaling to the right, and down. Repeat for one more round… When you’re done, take a deep breath and open mouth exhale to reset. Next, do 5 shoulder rolls in each direction. Inhale and bring your shoulders forward and up, then roll them back then down. Repeat this circular motion four more times, deep breathing throughout.... Now roll your shoulders 5 times in the the opposite direction, deep breathing throughout and loosening up your shoulder muscles. .... Take a deep breath and reset. Notice how your body feels now. Now that you've begun stretching, listen to your body. Where else would you like to stretch and release tension? Follow your intuition and what your body craves.... Maybe you want to stretch your legs and reach for your toes. Maybe you want to lay down and do some spinal twists. Whatever it may be, listen to your body and follow what your body is telling you..... Remember to deep breathe through each stretch. .... [ 2.5 min ] Whenever you're ready, move into a lying position. We'll start with a slow breathing exercise with 3 slow breaths. Take a deep breath into your abdomen... hold it there for 3 seconds, and exhale slowly, elongating your exhale as much as you can.... Take another deep breathe in through your nose, breathing into your abdomen.... hold it there for 3 seconds... and exhale slowly. One more breath like that, inhale into your abdomen, hold it for 3 seconds.. and then slowly exhale until you have no more air left. Take a healing breath in, and exhale it out... Feel your breath and heart rate slow down. It is time to completely let go, and allow yourself to just be. We will now relax the entire body, bringing awareness to one area at a time. With each area, feel your body melt into the bed—into total relaxation. Relax your forehead… Relax your eyebrows... Relax your lips… Relax all your facial muscles... Relax your scalp… Relax your brain… Relax your shoulders… Relax your arms... relax your hands… relax your fingertips. Relax your heart…. Relax your stomach. Relax your hips.. Relax your thighs... Relax your calves…. Relax your feet.... Relax your toes. Feel your entire body totally relax... Take a slow deep breath in... and a slow deep breath out.... allowing your body to sink into your bed, comfortably, peacefully. You are safe. You are safe now. .... Allow your mind to drift... into the space between the conscious and subconscious. You are safe. You are safe now. In this space of zero effort, there is nothing more for you to do, but to let go and allow yourself to rest. Rest. Beautiful, nourishing, loving - rest. You deserve it. Sending you so much love and light. Sweet dreams. & Namaste.

other realities breathe from galaxy to galaxy you explore seeing things you've never even imagined it before you choose the experience you wish to have and so you choose to stand amongst the stars they move and swirl in cyclones and waves they shine with an incomparable brightness and yet the brightness does not hurt your eyes it's as if you were looking at a soft glow instead you encircle them in or of what is happening you stick out your hands and the stars fall through the center of your palms and zip through the sky notice that the sound they make as they dash through the sky as you look

observe and admire [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] with complete trust in the universe you give yourself to the eye of the cyclone and you like the stars race down through the galaxies as you fly down when you run your fingers across and down the body of the stars somehow they do not feel separate from you it is as if you are experiencing your own touch looking around you can see other beautiful beings dancing upon the Stars as they continue their descent as you fly downward you begin to feel a familiar sensation of home closer and closer the sensation grows and suddenly the stars disappear and your feet may planted on a field of tall green grass [Music] there is immediate stillness the contrast between the stillness of standing versus the inertia of flying puzzles you for a moment and you stand there taking note of all that surrounds you the blades of grass feel cool soft and moist between your toes you look around fields of flowers being caressed by a golden stream of light the Golden Lion draws near to you moving through the air like a snake you desire to feel it touch you and so it is the golden light runs over your arms and suddenly your arms feel much warmer you take this light into your hands and form a ball staring at this ball you create the most radiant color patterns you have ever seen all colliding and spilling inside of this golden sphere you place the ball onto your chest and it seeps through to your heart warming it instantly you look down and watch the colors run through the insides of your body you can see every vein within you is filled with light your entire body warms and you are overwhelmed with joy the light has filled up everything within you and rays of color begin shining through your pores [Music] your pores expand opening themselves more and more to this experience [Music] you can no longer distinguish between yourself and this radiant light that shines through you the feeling of joy deepens and your

your life may need a little energy healing and you will give your spirit exactly what it needs compassion gentleness and the ability to transform into something more beautiful than you can ever imagine so for right now relax a little deeper feel every part of your body from your feet right up to your face from your scalp right down to your toes as you notice tension allow it to dissolve away sinking into a state of blissful calm feel your breath and relax [Music] [Music] as you grow more relaxed your attention drifts to a red light at the base of your tailbone this is the root chakra your connection with the earth and your physical body it grounds you and harnesses your energy at a very intuitive level this chakra is your sense of survival it has your will to live as such fear or trauma in this area can manifest itself through physical or mental imbalance fear or distrust of others at its best the chakra allows you to reconnect with wisdom and stories of your ancestors resting secure in your own place in the human family if you have struggled with any of these areas or simply wish to boost your courage and resourcefulness imagine this ruby red light growing stronger and more resolute with each inhale feel your strength and rootedness growing with every breath even as your body sinks into a deeper sense of calm [Music] your breath and awareness continues up your spine to rest just above your pelvis this is your sacral chakra represented by an orange light take a moment to sense the energy of this chakra is the orange light brilliantly colored or does it emit just a dull glow whatever you sense allow your breath to flow freely and without judgement as you listen to the wisdom of this chakra the second chakra is your Center for emotions pleasure nurturing and creation whatever that may mean to you our desire for warmth and nourishment resides here asked us the drive to create things that share our gifts and talents with the world a lack or surplus of any of these things can result in an imbalance or sense of disease in these areas so as you listen to the wisdom of your body feel your breath of stoking the fire of your second chakra restoring your energy and vitality breathing in and out [Music] [Music] as you grow more relaxed feel your mind shifting gently to your third chakra the energy center that pulses with yellow light just below your solar plexus the chakra is the home of your willpower and sense of belonging as you notice the way it looks and feels ask yourself if you have felt any discomfort in this area either physically or mentally are there places in your life that you feel you aren't meant to be do you have habits or routines you wish you could put an end to or develop further maybe with every breath you take this golden light grows brighter and brighter as the light brightens you can feel your sense of self and your personal drive returning to balance either increasing in strength or mellowing in intensity as you breathe and grow even more tranquil [Music] [Music] your body sinks deeper into the bed engulfed in a sea of relaxation your consciousness calm and at ease turned its attention to the fourth chakra lit by an emerald light resting at your heart this chakra like the ancient heart symbol represents love and compassion for yourself and others in its purest state this love is unconditional unreserved and filled with joy love is a part of everything from the way you order a meal at a restaurant to the way you talk to your body for many of us love is a subject tightened with anger pain and distrust [Music] as you breathe allow your mind to disconnect from past relationships experiences and beliefs that may limit your ability to love others without reason or expectation and as you do so feel your heart grow warmer and this emerald light become brighter and cleaner [Music] [Music] [Music] feel a breath rise a little higher stopping at your throat noticing the bright blue light that emanates from this part of your spiritual consciousness the chakra addresses speaking out truths sharing our creativity and ideas and moderating the balance of sharing and listening as you breathe a little deeper feeling muscle tension dissolving away ask yourself if this blue light is as vibrant as you would like is this something that you need to say that you haven't yet have you said something you regret do you balance your speaking with listening your creativity with rest if not smile gently at yourself and forgive even as you allow your focus to strengthen this area to better represent your spiritual intelligence and magnificent wisdom and as this light grows brighter cleaner more pure feel your body sink a little deeper into your bed the blankets around you soothing your body as your spirit grows stronger and brighter than ever before [Music] [Music] above this bright blue light is the darker regal glow of your sixth chakra the third eye chakra it is located just between your eyebrows and governs your ability to see and understand seeing in this context does not just imply the physical act of viewing what is around you instead it allows you to perceive the meaning of what you witness allow yourself to reflect on whether you have been missing the obvious or seeing things where there are none if you find yourself skewed one way or another simply allow your breath to realign your body and spirit as you feel your intuitive self grow in confidence and clarity breathe and feel this chakra between your eyes notice the sensations that come with it so you understand when the third eye begins to communicate through your physical presence [Music] [Music] [Music] and now your awareness reaches your seventh chakra the crown chakra which inhabits no physical space in your body but instead hovers above your scalp like a halo some people perceive this chakra as a royal purple while others see it as brilliant white the combination of all other colors of light whatever you may see here allow your consciousness to ponder the phrase I know for it is this Madra that guides this chakra boredom depression and confusion can result in an imbalance in this area for it is the crown chakra that helps us focus not on ourselves as individuals but on ourselves as a part of a greater whole so breathe in welcoming the unity that comes from the being part of something greater and feel your physical being revel in the unity of mind body and spirit breathe in and let go [Music] [Music] [Music] and now give yourself a moment to understand the way alignment feels in your body [Music] since the rainbow of light that begins at your tailbone and runs all the way up your spine illuminating your body and the room around you with a vibrant light feel the strength and confidence that comes from being totally aligned body mind and spirit working together in perfect concert feel it and breathe give yourself the permission you need to relax for a few moments utterly and completely giving yourself to this sense of deep relaxation and a wholeness at this moment in time you are in tune with the tremendous power yourself as the spoken part of this meditation draws to a close focus your attention on the way your body feels enjoy the sensations of harmony and peace as you feel your mind drifting into unconsciousness as your body follows suit breathe and know that you are complete namaste [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to this guided meditation my name is Jason and over the course of the next half hour or so we will journey into relaxation leaving your thoughts and worries behind as you saw through the sky this is a meditation about flying if you are uncomfortable with heights or nervous about the idea of floating on the air don't worry as long as you listen to the sounds of this meditation no harm can befall you you are entirely magnificently safe free to drift with ease of any a great burden with this in mind make sure you've found a comfortable position and when you are ready settle in and let your eyes drift closed take a moment to get back in touch with your breath how does it feel to inhabit your body right now are there any areas that seem more tense than usual can you let go of that pain just for a little bit and now turn your attention to your mind to the constant dialog that accompanies you through your waking life are there any sticking points in your thoughts or does your stream-of-consciousness flow through your mind easily nothing left behind if there is an issue a memory or a person who keeps cropping up ask yourself if you can let go of it just for a little bit even the most pleasant of thoughts and memories can cloud your meditation experience keep you from focusing and enjoying the present moment when you are ready turn your attention away from your body and your thoughts and toward your breath let the oxygen flow a little bit slower a little bit deeper [Music] and as you breathe allow your conscious mind to shut down and your imagination to awaken your body sinks deeper into the chair or mattress as your imagination wakes up bringing you visions of bright blue skies the sensation of flight [Music] imagine yourself standing up from your chair or bed wherever you might be right now imagine yourself walking out of this room all the way to the front door of your home or office [Music] as you stand outside on the sidewalk you take a giant leap into the air as you do so you find the air support you hold you suspended on your next inhale the wind catches you lifting you gently upward or quickly or as slowly as you would like you are flying in control of the direction and the speed of your path take a moment to experiment with your newfound ability dipping and twirling through the air as the wind tickles your cheese [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] far below you the ground looks like thousands of tiny rugs all laid together pinpricks of light spill across the landscape like glitter punctuated every so often by the fluffy green of a stand of trees lakes and rivers squiggle through the dusty plains and grassy Dells houses are sorted neatly into little rectangular yards divided up by narrow ribbons of gray pavements highway and interstate roadways meander around sharp mountain peaks the vehicles traveling along them with tiny flakes of color even the most chaotic sides where the construction projects or road work are neatly organized from above everything has a pattern articulated through swoops and grids and arcs visible only from the air if you would like now you can take some moments to examine them more closely or you can simply let go and enjoy the experience of flight [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the air supports you boys you up carries you along on it's warm currents you can feel the resistance against your arms a sensory knowledge that tells you exactly how sharply you can turn how deeply you can dive how quickly you can stop midair your body understands how to dip and twirl how to saw or slow down without your mind and necessarily knowing what must happen you are fearless carried by the knowledge that your muscles know exactly what to do with this in mind allow yourself to soar to dive to Bank against the wind allowing the sensations of flying to leave daily worries and stress far behind you you are as magnificent as an eagle as strong as wise as utterly in control as a majestic bird of prey enjoy it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as you saw along you encounter a flock of birds perhaps geese or songbirds on their migration somewhere following invisible ancestral flight plans through the clouds if you would like you can fly with them for a bit body instantly attuned to the way the air washes across their wings over their backs bearing them effortlessly along the wind you can speak with them enjoy their chatter or savor the silence and whenever you want you can bank with the wind off in another direction swooping low over mountain canyons and desert flowers feel the air temperature change your speed increase and decrease all with the easy confidence that your abilities bring [Music] there are some rain clouds off to one side if you would like you can fly through them feeling the cool rain on your back and face as you dance with the raindrops as you spin through the air gracefully entirely in control oh you could fly to where the Sun is just rising feeling the warmth of the morning creep over the horizon watching it gild the clouds with a heavenly light anything is within your reach here high above the earth here amongst the clouds you are completely safe and entirely in control your every moment as graceful as a ballet dancers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and now allow yourself to hear the call of your physical body the beckoning of the place where you began this meditation there is no rush to return instead let yourself frolic amongst the clouds dip between the travelling currents of air savor the grace and power within your body enjoy the tranquility within your mind watch the world below noting its geometrical rhythms the colors melting into one another [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] give yourself a few moments to find your home or office amongst the neatly organized buildings below you and when you are ready begin your gradual descent allow yourself to circle savoring the rush of air against your arms that particular pressure that assures you that you know exactly how to fly you move more slowly more confidently the lower you get at first the sites below you grow gradually larger sinks slowly down to the ground outside your home or office [Music] with a deep breath you open the front door move inside head back to whatever room you began this meditation in when you arrive you see your physical body calm relaxed resting take a moment remember the sensations of flying and when you are ready reach out your hand to touch your physical presence and feel yourself re inhabit your body when you are ready allow your eyes to open this meditation is drawing to a close and you are back amongst us just as majestic and graceful as when you were soaring amongst the clouds [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you

breathing because our inhales holds and exhales will all be equal amounts of time each breathing cycle will incrementally increase in length as we progress both inhales and exhales will be through your nose for every breath start breathing through your nose now this breathing method is effective in calming the nervous system relaxing your mind and reducing stress it is especially effective when trying to relax and fall asleep in fact why don't you start getting comfortable right now pull back the sheets and blankets lay your head down on your comfortable pillow settle in a body at rest is the first step to a mind at rest lying down is an important surrender a surrender - gravity it's you giving up that constant exertion and muscle tension that accumulates over the day just from standing and walking bring your focus to the soles of your feet and see how much tension there is to let go of there feel the light tingle in your arches and toes that's the relief of not having to hold the body to wait any longer as you continue to scan your body moving up from the feet let the rest of your muscles follow suit relaxing one by one it's time to give up and let gravity cradle you into your bed you have to give up control in order to fall asleep give up any restless streams of thought give up thinking about the day you just had for the day you're about to start just be here in between and know that this is your time for release and restoration keep in mind breathing exercises can be challenging for some people I'm here to be your guide there is no success or failure in this exercise just go at your own pace and stop to rest as needed keep breathing in through the nose out through the nose [Music] let's begin [Music] start by just taking a few deep breaths like stretching

exhales by one second each round until we get to eight seconds so after our four second round we will slow and deepen our breath for a five second round then a six second round followed by a seven second round ending on an eight second round of inhale hold exhale that's equal breathing now that we're calm and comfortable let's begin following my count inhale two three four hold two three four

1 [Music] [Music] the chakras and your higher self guided meditation hello and welcome to this guided meditation my name is Jason Stevenson and thank you for taking the time to join me and trusting in my work this meditation will consist of a body relaxation to begin with followed by the spoken chakra and communing with your higher self too often we get so caught up in our lives that we forget to really live and really living means existing beyond the confines and demands of schedules immediate wants and needs the expectations of others and the need to conform I wonder if you can remember what it was like as a child what it was like to just be to live and to be joyful without a question to live free of doubt and self-criticism it's all about being in the moment enjoying it free of expectations and just being alive William Blake put it best when he wrote to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour it's and so beautiful but I guess we think but how can you hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour is it even possible yes it is true.you exists in all things and all things exist within you when you truly understand that you experience the entire universe within yourself and yourself as the entire universe once you experience that then you grasp that heaven already dwells within you as does infinity within that heaven lies all possibility and all joy and with that infinite space lies infinite wisdom and infinite power all begins with breath the bridge between your smaller self and your higher self let's begin just finding a comfortable place either seated or lying down making sure there are no distractions for the next 30 minutes or so and just breathing in and out now through your nose and seeing if you can slow your breath down to a count of three so breathing in on a count of three through your nose and releasing that breath on a count of three so it's inhaling one two three exhale one two three and just see if you can keep a steady rhythm similar to this but that's comfortable for you the remainder of this meditation we'll begin with a body scan now just becoming aware of your body and starting at the top of your head noticing any sensations here the density and the space this area takes up and including in that awareness as your phorid I'm aware of this area [Music] without judgment just being aware and feeling any sensations that may arise [Music] and taking in and awareness of your eyes your ears your nose and cheeks [Music] your mouth and lips or teeth the entire face sensing any sensations even sensing where the air meets your skin and becoming aware moment by moment if any sensations or feelings that you feel come and go and during this time if your mind wanders that's simply okay just allow it to be your only role is to simply acknowledge your thought if it wanders and then come back to focusing on the parts of your body my voice and sensations that you feel [Music] so we're going to shift that focus now from the top of your head and your face moving it down to the neck your shoulders you might even feel your shoulders relaxed a little this is a place where we store a lot of tension our shoulders and our shoulder blades also being aware of your neck and your throat area [Music] you're sensing what is going on here [Music] you might even be able to feel air coming and going in the throat area moving down now to focus on your arms elbows [Music] and your forearms [Music] and down to your wrists and your hands [Music] your hands may be either resting on your lap or at your side right down to your fingertips [Music] see if you can sense the weight of your hands and each individual finger [Music] and any sensations that you may feel just being aware moment by moment [Music] and shifting your awareness now up to your chest area you may sense the rise and fall of your chest the subtle rise and fall [Music] and bringing your awareness to your ribcage the front the sides of your ribcage and ride around your upper back its resting either against the chair or on the mattress of your bed if you sense any tension or aches or pains just bring a gentle awareness to this not forcing any pain or aches away but rather just simply being aware [Music] moving that awareness down now to the abdomen area your stomach feeling sensations here you may feel it softening releasing and just the chest you may feel your belly rising and falling as the air comes and goes whatever you feel whatever you sense just be open and aware and accept [Music] and shifting that awareness now to the lower back area [Music] you may send some pressure here [Music] and continue to shift your focus to the pelvis area your buttocks being aware the space that this takes up the air against your skin any sensations that you may feel allow them to come and go with full acceptance [Music] continue now to bring your awareness to your thighs the top of your thighs besides inner thighs and underneath you may feel the pressure of where you're laying or seated sensing the weight of your legs if your mind begins to wander at all that's okay just simply bring it back now to focusing on your thighs and moving now down to focusing on your knees the top bony part of your knee and the inner fleshy part underneath in full awareness just accepting anything that comes and goes any sensations feelings thoughts with full acceptance [Music] you may become aware of some discomfort or pain that is okay to just be with this [Music] moving your attention now to your calf muscles of both legs if you were lying down in bed you may feel the calf muscles spread against your bed [Music] and shifting around your shins and finally bringing your attention to both of your feet the soles of your feet any pressure that's attending here the breach of both feet ankles and right down to your toes each single toe you may even sense the space between each toe [Music] [Music] just checking in on your breathing now and feeling this breath sustaining you breathing in and out throughout your entire body [Music] and seeing if you can take in now the awareness of your entire body from your feet all the way up to the top of your head [Music] accepting all that is without judgment just being aware [Music] just stay with this for a few moments and allow yourself to relax further [Music] I'd like you to bring your focus now to the base of your spine [Music] and Eli's your first chakra the part of you that says I am see if you can bring your breath here and give thanks for your sense of being inhale into this chakra and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I am just stay with this for a few more breaths [Music] [Music] I'd like you to now bring your attention to the spot just below your belly button this is your second chakra the part of yourself that says by desire and see if you can breathe into this point and give thanks for your existence as you exhale mentally say to yourself by desire and just stay with this for a few breaths [Music] now if you'd bring your attention to your belly button this is your third chakra area which gives you the urge to act just bring your in-breath here and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I act and keep this breath going here for a few moments focusing now on your solar plexus and this is located just beneath the midpoint of your chest and this is your fourth chakra the part of you that feels take your in-breath here and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I feel and again just staying here for a few breaths now bring your attention to the base of your throat and here lies your fifth chakra the part of you that expresses bring your in-breath here and as you exhale mentally say to yourself and make myself known and please keep this up for the span of a few breaths now bringing your focus to the space between your brows this is where your sixth chakra is the part of you the comprehends breathe into this spot and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I understand and stay here for a few moments [Music] now with your eyes still closed see if you can raise your eyes and try to look at the roof of your head don't strain yourself just if you feel discomfort or pain just lower your gaze until you find a position you're comfortable with here at the top of your head lie as your seventh chakra the part of you that understands things free of prejudice discrimination feeling and attachment so bring your in-breath E and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I know and we'll stay here for a few moments shifting your awareness now to pay attention to your entire length of your spine visualize it as a white pillar of light whose bottom starts at the base of your spine rising up through your body up past your neck rises through the middle of your head and right to the top of your head if it helps you can imagine that your entire body is a pole made of pure white light one end of that light rises up through the middle topmost part of your head stretching many miles above you with your eyes raised as high as you can comfortably lift try to see where that light goes as it rises up past the roof of your head although that beam of light goes off into eternity there is a sort of barrier that lies some 12 inches above your head this is the eighth chakra also called the great sound from your perspective it might look like an umbrella or as if you were sitting beneath a great transparent jellyfish loading some 12 inches above your head it's also called the witness the part of you that's attached to your body but isn't in your body [Music] this witness is the midway point between your physical self and your higher self which has never been born and can never die you might like to think of it as a boy bobbing on the water's surface beneath that boy is a string attached to the oceans floor the beam of light that starts at the base of your spine and shoots out through the top of your head between the boy on the water's surface and the anchor that keeps it bound to the oceans for liars and not and that knot is the witness connecting your physical body your highest self which never lives and never dies [Music] rising up that beam of light that point some 12 inches above your head is a light body it's a detached version of you one that knows your likes and dislikes your passions and urges it doesn't judge you simply observes and record your thoughts and your feelings without thinking or feeling them [Music] as the witness you sent your body below feel it breathing gently beneath you [Music] as you witness you feel and see the line of light stretching forth above you toward infinity there is an ebb and flow of impressions and sensations that your lower self transmits to you in flashes remember there you sit a float in a timeless sense of being you are light made of light and encased in light emitting light from that perspective you see but do not judge the actions of your lower self you see it scrambled back and forth like a toddler just learning to walk like a child it makes mistakes as it was born to do but how else can it learn [Music] this is part and parcel of who and what it is that one that sits a liar's in meditation is calling out to you but may feel lost alone adrift or in need of guidance may feel disconnected confused and grounded it reaches for you as a toddler reaches out to its mother just listening now it asks for guidance reach out simply reach out and reminder that it is loved it has always been loved and will always be loved [Music] with each in-breath that draws the memory of you deeper into itself with each out breath it stretches forth and reaches out to you here in this moment [Music] let the barriers of memory weaken so that the body sitting below you can feel you again feel its gentle rhythmic in-breath and out-breath expand and contract its wondrous body drawing you in with each inhalation and reaching out to you with each exhalation guide it that it may live in wisdom and power so that it may make the right choices at the right time in the right place and with the right people guide it but it may live in dignity and grace making the right choices at the right time at the right place with the right people guide it that it may live in peace and joy [Music] guided that it may speak to you and hear you whenever the need arises always at the right time at the right place and with the right people [Music] through your guidance may had finally learn to see the world in a grain of sand and heaven in everyone and everything even itself [Music] through your guidance made finally learn the power of seeing infinity in its own existence and eternity in the joy of every breath and every passing moment [Music] [Music] bring your focus back to the top of your head be all that light of your own power above you and know that it will always be there whenever you need its guidance simply be still and breathe slowly rhythmically [Music] inhale now and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I know [Music] and again inhale and on the exhale say I know [Music] and stay with this for a few moments return your focus to the spot between your eyebrows gently lower your eyes so they gaze at the back of your foreign [Music] inhale and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I understand inhale exhale I understand [Music] still focused on your breathing keeping your eyes closed and slowly return your breathing to normal bringing your breath back to an easy comfortable rhythm at this point you may return to waking life who you may continue to drift off into a deeper purposeful sleep welcome home my friend

1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this sleep meditation hypnosis over the course of the next few minutes we will journey through four different environments exploring peace and relaxation in the context of each one of them at the end you will have the freedom to select the right one for you attuning your spiritual surroundings to what you need for health healing and your happiness with this in mind allow a calm sense of expectation to rise in your mind and set an intention to rest deeply and completely feel your body relaxed more than it has in a long while all the tension in your body dissolving bit by bit let every muscle in your body relax even those in the place you normally hold tired this may be your forehead your lips or jaw the back of your head your shoulder blades your lower back your belly your knees or ankles and right down to the tendons in your feet feel your whole body melt into wherever you rest and allow the surface around you to support your body let's begin our meditation so lying down keeping your back straight as much as you can feel your body becoming more serene you are still and peaceful in this breath and the next as you relax you begin to hear the crash of water in the distance as you sink a little deeper into relaxation it grows louder until you yourself are standing on the banks of an enormous waterfall it is morning and the sunlight catches the water as it falls creating thousands of tiny rainbows in the spray around the cliff the rumble of moving water is at once both soothing and awe-inspiring a symphony of Earth's very essence tumbling around you take a moment to breathe in this majesty [Music] [Music] as you look more closely at the waterfall bill the cool mist envelop your face leaving dewy droplets on your cheeks and Florida feel the vitality and power of this place all around you in the warmth of the cliff bases the gentle glow of the Sun the frothy water around the Falls notice yourself becoming karma beginning to let go of your worries and physical tension allow yourself to breathe letting the rush of the water guide you into a deeper relaxation allow yourself to feel the slow transitions from inhale to exhale and from exhale to inhale note the tiny delicate paws in the center of these transitions that space where inhalation ends but before exhalation begins breathe as deeply or as shallowly as comfortable for you your chest moving rhythmically and effortlessly as you sink a little deeper into relaxation letting go of any worry or stress if at any time your mind wanders simply bring it gently back to your breath a calming gentle process of bringing air into your lungs feel any tension in your body lift away with every breath you take nothing can hurt you here enjoy these next few moments next to the waterfall letting your worries dissolve under the relentless rumble of fresh rainwater [Music] [Music] as you notice the sounds of the meditation begin to change allow your imagination to follow your feelings to follow creating around you a magnificent sandy beach waves break in crystalline sprays and the call of seagulls eases your mind smell the sharp tang of salt and the warm dustiness of hot sand let your shoulders droop and your fora done crease in the background you can hear the wash of the ocean waves breaking on the beach you can watch the water if you like or close your imaginary eyes and simply dwell in the presence of your other senses breathe and listen let everything else go so much of meditation is the practice of letting go of accepting that you cannot control everything around you of welcoming in the infinite glorious possibilities and opportunities that are waiting for you letting go of your conscious discipline your task oriented nature is the gateway to relaxation so taking a breath in and exhale letting go of the need to control your experience just for a few minutes allow yourself to feel whatever arises letting go of everything negative and treasuring the beauty of this moment's experience as your body lets go of any tension your breath slows down and it may deepen just a slight bit simply follow its rhythm listening to the quiet in and out of air in your lungs if you would like match your breath to the tempo of the sea nearby following the rise and fall of the waves behind whatever feels most comfortable most relaxing and embrace it this is your chance to discover and choose whatever you need to rest most fully and again as the music and sounds of this meditation begin to change allow yourself to be transported to the banks of a freshwater brook or river where fish jump and the sunlight glints on the wet rocks as you take a deep inhale you breathe in the burbling sound of water on stones and the gentle sigh of wind in the young tree boughs take another deep breath and then release it relishing the warmth of the air that leaves your body feel your feet sink into the soft grass of the riverbank and notice the bright green color of early spring if you would like you may dip your foot into the stream noticing the way the water washes over your toes cooling your skin you can hear a few honeybees buzzing about enjoying the landscape as much as you are you know that the bees will not harm you and so you can continue to enjoy the gentle harmony they make a soft sound that sets off the silver tinkling music of the creek a little way in front of you a butterfly flutters on the breeze dipping and soaring with the invisible current of the wind you hold out your hand and it floats closer to you landing on your skin with an almost imperceptible touch allow yourself to lay down on the riverbanks feeling the way the grass molds around your body supporting your back and neck so you can relax more completely above you you can see a fluffy white cloud a clear blue sky all around you are the sounds of nature peaceful and rhythmic your thoughts disappeared replaced by this music of nature you can feel all the aches and pains in your body dissolve away as you sink a little deeper into the warm grass relaxed and at peace in this beautiful landscape give yourself permission to enjoy it as you breathe you feel yourself growing lighter more relaxed almost as if the stresses and tensions of the day are being washed away in the cheerful sound of the river breathe in welcoming inspiration and peace breathe out exhaling worry and fear this is your time embrace it now in these next few moments and now as the music and sounds around you change one small breathe in and find yourself on the path of a majestic and ancient forest the trail through the forest is verdant lined with the carpet of the grass your feet sink into it's slightly brushing against the soft coolness of its surface birds sing in the trees a symphony of natural beauty some chirp back and forth others trill melodies into the wind a gentle breeze sways in the trees and the soft touch of its passing soothes your skin the sunshine is less bright here dappled and soft instead of its usual brash gold the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to and yet it is a soothing coolness filled with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss [Music] [Music] as you walk further and deeper into the forest the trees become larger their trunks wider and spaced further apart in the resulting space hangs a mantle of pearly fog floating a few feet above the ground as you walk your legs stir the fog and it swirls around you gauzy tendrils lazy soft against your skin birdsong accompanies you along your journey lifting your spirit and soothing your body with its innocent sounds let your self marvel at the size of these trees as wide around as dining tables and almost taller than your eyes can see smell the dampness of believes and dirt underneath them nourishing and protecting their roots imagine how far these tree's roots must extend into the earth in order to remain sturdy and upright above all allow the nature's music to guide you into further relaxation as you breathe deeply watching the sunlight meander back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze bring your attention to yourself are you holding any tension or is there any pain in your body are you carrying or holding on to something in your back your neck or your shoulders is there tension in your hips or perhaps the way you squeeze your eyelid shut how does it feel to be you right now you are still and tranquil United with this peaceful an ageless environment feel your body relaxing as you breathe a little deeper letting go of anything that might distract you let yourself focus completely on the beauty of the forest sense it feel what it's like welcoming the harmony and stillness that accompanies it [Music] allow your attention to travel across your body noticing how deeply your muscles and tendons have relaxed since now the space between your thoughts the ease with which your mind moves between thoughts never lingering too long on one subject you feel calm peaceful and daddy's now in this state of quiet peace as this meditation spoken part comes to an end allow your mind to return to that place savoring the beautiful details as you sink further into this state of happy equanimity let your breath guide you and enjoy the final moments of music as you drift off into a deep and peaceful sleep rest well my friend rest well you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] release all mind matters a meditation just prior to sleeping begin to find your connection to yourself a constant unbreakable tie that might have been silenced or ignored throughout the course of a busy day only you know what you went through today and only you can begin to release its hold on you tomorrow will be another day but for now this is time just for you time for stillness clarity and relaxation finding a comfortable place either seated or lying down and taking a breath breathing in and release let that breath go and again breathing in and release let that breath go in and let go as we get further in tation relax even further over the course of our time together we examine everything your mind dwells on and use your breath to release everything in preparation for a deep and healing rest if it helps you imagine that you are passing these worries on to a higher power or greater wisdom in the universe allowing this presence to carry your burden until you elect to pick it back up again if you find this challenging simply imagine your thoughts melting dissolving or blowing away according to what feels most natural to you let's begin the beginning portion of any meditation practice is the most challenging give your mind permission to take a break from all its work this is time for rest and healing take a deep breath in and exhale as you breathe start to let go of your expectations for this meditation everything is happening as it should even if you don't realize it even if you don't see it even if you don't expect it to especially then underneath it all lies a web of connections and new and beautiful threads are being added every day breathe deeper and that someday soon you will be able to find meaning in what might at first appear to be a giant tangle you do not need to look or sound a certain way to find deep peace and contentment follow your heart and intuition slow and effortless is a time now for letting go this may be a guided meditation but it is not a scripted meditation it's up to you to find your place your breathing and your Zen within it you are guided not led and this practice is your own so make it yours as you breathe in and exhale sink deeper and relax relax [Music] [Music] [Music] this meditation is a sleep meditation but it is okay if you do not fall asleep at the end of it ultimately this meditation practice is about gaining greater calm and stillness within your own life take a deep breath in and exhale feeling the microscopic changes in your body as you do this trust that your body knows what it needs if you fall asleep before the end of this recording perhaps you are in need of a little extra rest and if you make it all the way through your body desires a relief from the physical pressures of the thoughts that are weighing you down right now nothing here is good or bad right or wrong you are simply you caught in a current of ever deepening relaxation embrace these since a even as you let go of your expectations for sleep [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if you are upset about your own watered expectations for yourself release them plants goals hopes dreams intentions desires whatever you name them let go letting something or someone else carry them as you rest you may reclaim them whenever you desire but for now simply breathe trust that everything is happening at the correct pace trust that things are happening in the right order know that everything even the gray successes look like failures in the thick of things you have permission from yourself and others to rest to tend to your own well-being and sometimes the person who needs this reminder most is you and so breathe a little deeper because you can allow your limbs to relax a little further because it's possible and give yourself permission luxurious decadent permission to fall deeply and powerfully asleep it is not a command only permission your body may do whatever it pleases sinking even deeper into the peace and comfort of the present moment [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it does not matter what you are worried about at this moment know that there are thousands of other people in the world undergoing the same or similar pain concerns about health appearance money Korea relationships in the future we all share these worries and yet for every person in pain there are two people or beings or presences sending them positive energy and blessings at this very moment if you have the strength send your own loving healing energy out into the world extending love and hope to your fellow humankind and on your next inhale feel it returning to you magnified by the light of a thousand beautiful souls worry is just that worry it will not chain anything it will not improve anything it will only tempt you and snare you keep you from the deep restful sleep you so deeply desire so give yourself permission to let go of the worries all the worries give even this anxiousness a chance to relax this is your space to heal and to breathe [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as you listen to the sounds of this meditation feel yourself sinking even deeper into relaxation your mind is soft your body's still uncomfortable every part of you is at peace nothing disturbs you if a stray thought or musing should appear simply breathe it away returning to this state of tranquillity and with each breath your body relaxes a little further the thoughts come slower and slower until you realize that it has been a very long time since your mind was occupied with anything other than the serene sensations of rest allow your breath to guide you deeper easing you into a more profound state of relaxation [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] with each breath you feel your mind body and spirit becoming more closely aligned any leftover thoughts from the day continue to dissolve muscles tendons and ligaments often more doubts and uncertainties fade away this is the essence of peace of finding the spaces between your inhale and your exhale of finding the serenity in daily life breathe and imagine your scalp relaxing the creases in your face loosening your tongue unsticking from the roof of your mouth each tendon your neck let's go every bone in your spine separating gently returning to the natural state of balance it all happens effortlessly relaxation increasing with each deep inhale and long exhale just breathe and allow your body to slip a little deeper into relaxation [Music] [Music] [Music] you are here grounded in the present moment still and comfortable and fully relaxed your body is heavy and your mind is at peace lulled deeper into sleep with each passing strain of music and deep breath nothing here can disrupt you can lure your way sleep is inevitable a

1 [Music] greetings my friends my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this sleep meditation guardians of the rainforest where you will journey deep into the lush rainforests and your questions will be answered allowing you to drift into a deep and restful sleep [Music] just making sure that you are comfortable now completely comfortable lying on your back with your arms by your side wriggling around until you get comfortable gently closing your eyes and using this initial time to take in a number of deep breaths sending that breath all the way down to your belly area breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth as you're breathing in be comfortable where you are and knowing that you're in the right place at the right time for this moment [Music] [Music] and returning your breath to a natural comfortable rhythm in and out through your nose as you do this becoming aware of the sensations of the breath as it goes into your belly we feel it expand doesn't leaves your belly you feel your belly just go down slightly this is not a forced breath or forced movement rather it's just a reaction a natural reaction to the breath going in and out moment by moment breath by breath [Music] [Music] [Music] I'd like you to become aware now of your entire body where your body meets the bed where your heels are resting your arms and your hands lying by your side and feeling the weight of your body feeling the sensations of the sheets or blankets against your body or the pillow supporting your head [Music] and what I'd like you to do in these next few moments is to allow a body scan from the top of your head right down slowly to the tips of your toes and as you scan your body you're going to go along and witness any sensations that might be happening within various parts of your body now this may be physical sensations or it may be even stored emotions it's not about changing anything it's just about being present with your body your physical sensations and your emotions so scanning now from the top of your head right down to the tip of your toes and take a few minutes to do this and I will return [Music] [Music] [Music] I'd like you to visualize yourself now entering a lush green rain forest a place that seems almost magical hundreds of thousands of years old trees and foliage and a river that meanders to the right side of you you begin to go down to this river and walk alongside it as you do paying attention to the sounds of this river the healing sensations that it delivers to you you are at peace here there's no one else to disturb you only you and nature each time a thought comes up for you allow that thought to float by and you might like to project that thought into the river and allow that thought to trickle downstream actually see that the thought beginning to be placed into the river and beginning to leave you watch it as it goes the tune comes to your mind row row row your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream the river and all the stones within the river are here today to have lessons to teach you gentle lessons reminders because you already know inherently what it is here to teach you as you continue to walk up a slanted hill the gentle rivers still rolling along beside you you hear it whisper to you you already have everything you need it says you already have everything you need this reminder circulates throughout you at times you might be striving wanting reaching desiring something else to come in your life the river is here to tell you that you are already connected to everything that is and whatever you need whatever you desire is really only a thought away from your reality it all begins with a thought you are the co-creator of your life it's almost like you can let go of the striving this is not by any means being lazy rather it's simply surrendering to the process and trusting that your gentle actions are already in place manifesting your desires take a moment now to visualize the river and put your hands in allow the waters to splash to your face be grateful for this river and for all you have within your life at this time you might want to say a silent thank you as you continue on to move upwards the Sun peers through the top of the canopy of the rain forest creating almost a halo effect around you warming you soothing you you can almost feel the vibration of the cells within your body as they come alive from this beautiful sunlight you stand still in this place and allow the sun's rays to sink into your mind your body and spirit and so you continue the gentle sounds of the river following you as you continue on your path you take some time now to sit at the riverbank and allow your feet to soak within the cool water enjoy the coolness of the water as it flows between your toes around your feet and feeling the gravelly earth within the riverbed itself soothing your feet you might even want to rub them with in this gravelly earth almost like a massage for your feet as you look upstream you begin to see a bottle floating down with a note inside it as it comes closer to you you catch the bottle and you pour the cork out and read the note as you open up the note take a look at what it says you read the note the words materialize almost out of thin air they say you are loved for the uniqueness of who you are go out there and shine and let it be known to the world here is another reminder to you that something you inherently already know and yet sometimes you dismiss this you don't feel worthy you don't feel that you were good enough well this note is here to tell you that right now you are loved you are worthy and you are perfect in this very moment and it's calling out for you to truly recognize this and to acknowledge this to feel this with all your entire being and once you acknowledge this you give a mission for others to light up their lives too for others to recognize the love within themselves just take a few moments to sit with this to sit with this love within you you might begin to feel it radiating from the inside out allowing your body to grow lighter and shine brighter with every breath in and out you take this note and you place it back into the bottle and put the cork back on throwing it back into the river and allowing someone else downstream to receive the same message you begin to get up and continue on your journey [Music] as you continue on a little squirrel runs past you he stops looks at you you look at him and even if only for a few moments you connect with him your eyes meet the squirrel looks peaceful in this environment content and he's here to simply remind you that in this moment you're content that you can allow thoughts of yesterday and worries or concerns of tomorrow to let go because these are not your reality your reality is only in this present moment this is your reality right here in this forest now this is your reality you feel this wonderful connection with this squirrel and he scampers away you continue on climbing inclines and steeper Hills the river still below you babbling away as you reach the top of the hill you see an enormous pine tree with a wooden rope ladder and you begin to climb this tree you are safe you feel safe up and up you go [Music] beginning to be far above the river and this tree continues on even past the top of the canopy so right now you are up the top of this tree you see a hammock swinging from branch to branch just the perfect size for you and decide to spend some time swinging laying down with in this hammock right above the beautiful lush rainforest you're comforted here and supported and of course safe just enjoy lying here whilst the Sun envelops you soothes you and comfort you [Music] feel the Sun penetrating right deep down into every cell of your entire body energizing you healing you on a deep sea level relaxing you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just as you are enjoying this sunlight this gentle swinging of the hammock from high above the forest and the river a gentle tapping is on your right shoulder and as you open your eyes you see a baby chimpanzee he looks in your eyes with a joyous smile he just gently pat your head for a moment and it's like he's communicating directly to you with no word spoken reminding you of your child within and the joyous times you've had as a child think of how simple it was no concerns no worries no problems just happy within that moment at one particular moment see if you can recall a particular moment as a child when you were happy recall what it felt like see if you can pinpoint where that joy sprung from that excitement and he's here to remind you that this joy this inner child this happiness is always within you and you may sometimes need to take a little more time out to connect with this joy to do what pleases you to do what makes you smile and to look after that little girl or boy that is within you and has always been within you do what makes this little child feel happy and you can carry this back into your waking life the chimpanzee looks at you with a mischievous grin and he bounds away swinging from one vine to the next calling out as he goes you decide to have one last look around at the top of this canopy before you begin to climb back down the wooden rope ladder as you go down thanking the mischievous monkey breeze lessons on your inner child you finally reach the floor of the forest and continue now on your journey beginning to go downhill again getting closer and closer to the riverbank as you continue downwards towards the river you see an old man sitting in the seat it's a carved out wooden log the seat that has probably been here for centuries he's a frail old man and he turns to see you he motioned you to come and sit with him and he has a glint of joy within his eyes he says to you just for this moment be still no thoughts needed just be still and enjoy the sounds of the beautiful rainforest around you and so you sit with him and begin to listen and it's like the sounds of the rainforest a magnified a symphony of nature to your ears just enjoy these next few moments [Applause] you turn to look at the frail old man and he reminds you never be afraid to take time out to do nothing because in that nothingness there is everything that you need contained there you acknowledge this and you say goodbye to the old man and you continue on your journey as you continue on the meandering path alongside the river the sounds of water gushing begin to get louder and louder it seems like there is a large waterfall ahead excitedly you continue to move towards the sound the sound gets louder and begins to wash all over you reverberating through your entire body as you turn a corner a giant waterfall is seen a large cavern behind the 100-foot waterfall water cascading way above your head it's just you here you and the waterfall and nature you edged yourself close to the waterfall and put your arm underneath it you can feel the heaviness of the water as a pounds against your arms and hands it's cool but not too cold you see a little trail that leads behind the cavern of this giant waterfall and you decide to go under this and from here you can see the water pounding right in front of you splashing down to the rocks and the river below this waterfall is here to remind you of the strength you have within any obstacles that come forth in your life but you have this power within to overcome them to see them through no matter how dark these times may be this strength this inner strength can overcome almost any obstacle set before you and if there is an obstacle that can't be moved just like the waterfall it just travels around it and moves onwards not stopping not fearing just continuing to move with the flow of life you are how you are strength just be with this for a moment and allow the water to fall reminding you of all the strength you have all your ever need is right within you right at this moment you head on now back out from under the cabin back in the direction where you came you thank the waterfowl for the reminder as you begin to follow the river back downstream going with the flow of life you continue on with in the forest with the flow of the river passing the old man once more still seated on the carved out wooden chair you acknowledge each other and move on you pass the wooden rope ladder again a chimpanzee the squirrel and just as you begin to get closer to the edge of the forest a Sun shower begins to fall gently down rather than running from this you rejoice in this and look upwards and see this water gently coming down and refreshing you reminding you to surrender to life but whatever comes up for you to not try and force things aside to not try and push motions down [Music] but rather to acknowledge everything that happens and surrender to it allow it to be and this makes your job in life so much easier so much more comfortable and joyous it's almost like you can use life as your playground you don't have to tighten your grip on anything it just be enjoy whatever happens at any point in given time allow it to be and in allowing it to be as it is it gives you so much power and strength you're acknowledging this present moment you won't have to get lost in the past or in the future within your mind these can be waste of time and this is all you have right here and now so just stand here and allow this gentle Sun shower to wash away old thoughts or remaining concern and be truly present coming back now you're leaving the forest as you do take one more moment to glance back and to thank the forest for all it has offered you today but every reminder that it has given you right now you're returning to your body where you can continue on begin to sleep and with the knowing that right now there is nothing else that needs to be done you can sleep be present

benefits of lavender oil and happen to have some you can rub some on your temples and your pulse points take a moment now to turn off all distractions and pause this recording if there's anything you need to do to prepare yourself for safe and comfortable night sleep know that you are safe and supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you choose to do so as we begin allow your eyes to close gently and focus your attention on your breath imagine the air you are breathing in as a warm glowing light that fills you up and heals you from the inside hold your breath for just a moment allowing this light to go deep down into your belly and then let out that breath gently allowing any physical and emotional attention to leave your body with your exhale again take another deep breath hold it for a short moment and this time take your time with the exhale slowing it down take the next few moments to breathe in this way for three more cycles of breath each cycle allow the exhale to slow down a little more than the breath before it and feel your body soften and your thoughts slow down even more with each passing breath now releasing that breath pattern and allowing your breath to return to its natural rhythm and notice how you are feeling how you're focused breathing pattern has slowed your heart rate is quiet in your mind it has brought about a heavy sense of calm to your physical body with each breath in bring a sense of relaxation into your body and with each breath out breathe out tension being fully present to this moment to your physical body to the sounds around you and to the surface below you set the intention for peace and relaxation for your physical body and for you mentally and spiritually for today open your heart and your mind to the opportunity the state of comfort and mindfulness offers for healing your body know that you are safe and fully supported to release stress and improve your health and well-being as you sleep deeply for the night you take another slow breath in making it your deepest breath yet and as you release that breath feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside feel that your body is becoming heavy and calm take a moment to be fully present with the physical sensations of your body right now let go of distractions let go of your responsibilities let go of expectations of what you might think this experience should be and simply surrender to the process of relaxation notice what you are feeling without changing or judging just notice you might feel a light tingling sensation in the palms or a floating sensation in your body that comes and goes or you may feel a comforting heaviness throughout your body you may begin to notice it feels as if there is no difference between where your body ends and where the surface below you begins whatever you're feeling is perfect and you just observe the feelings and sensations as you allow yourself to enjoy this journey allow yourself to turn the whole world off and to go within with my voice as a guide to deep sleep in a moment now I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the top of your head going all the way through your body to your feet as you see each part of your body in your mind's eye you will relax that body part completely and as you move your attention throughout the body you will scan for any areas of tension tightness or pain if there are areas of tension you will stay on that part of your body for a moment and breathe in the warm healing light right into that area to soften it you will ask your body to relax and release and this warm loving light will melt the tension away from your body and allow you to fully relax as you continue scanning your body you will feel this relaxing and healing energy move through you as it takes you deeper and deeper into a safe and supported state of sleep and recovery as this light passes over your body it progressively relaxed as you and releases each muscle small and large and now let's begin the slow process of relaxing the entire body to prepare for a deep and productive sleep for the night now begin to ask for release from your scalp and head and feel your forehead soften and smooth the tiny muscles around your eyebrows melt and you can allow the tension from the day to dissolve from your face peel your eyelids becoming very heavy part your teeth unclench your jaw and relax your tongue this softening of your faith and Jah will deepen the relaxation of your entire body you can now feel your throat softening and you notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper allowing this wave of comfort to continue its journey down your body you feel your chest and shoulders release and rest heavy every breath in brings healing air into your belly and allows the abdomen to let go even further and now allow both arms to relax and feel as all of the tension from your upper body flows out through your fingertips and as you continue to breathe in fresh healing oxygen into your chest and abdomen your body is able to use this oxygen to recover and repair from your activities of daily life and now inviting the relaxation to continue its path down your body into your hips and lower back linger on this area a little longer and ask your body for a sense of ease let go of all the tension held in this area feel your body softening as each in-breath creates space for an easy flow of energy through your body this comfort moves into both of your legs washing relaxation over your thighs your knees and your calves and you feel any remaining tension tightness or pain flush out of your body through the bottoms of your feet so that you are completely relaxed throughout your entire body know that your relaxed body will allow for a productive recovery while you sleep so you all wake feeling refreshed and rejuvenated after a good night's sleep you are now deeply relaxed and you can begin to use your imagination to visualize yourself from the outside as if you are an observer looking down at yourself lying in your bed and your very own room I will guide you on a journey taking you into a dream state and you can simply follow my voice or drift off to sleep whenever you are ready see yourself right where you are in your own bed in your own room but imagine now that your room has a moonroof just like a car it's able to slide open with the push of a button in your mind see as your ceiling begins to slowly open right above your bed so that it begins to reveal the open night sky directly above you you are still nice and cozy in your bed completely safe and supported and now you can look up into the night sky and see all of the many stars shining bright you can see the moon lit up above you and the clouds passing by as each cloud passes by you notice the thoughts in your head going along with them and your body becomes more and more relaxed as each one passes by you can feel all of the tension from the day leaving your body and your mind with each cloud as well and now find the brightest star in the sky and bring your attention to that star only bring this brightest star in the sky into full focus and allow the rest of the background to blur slightly in your vision in this dream state continue for the next few moments to focus your attention on the one brightest star in the sky you in your mind allow your gaze to soften and your attention can now brought in to the bigger picture of the sky with all of the stars in it and in a moment I will guide you to count the stars above you beginning from 10 counting down to 1 and with each star you count you will get deeper and deeper into relaxation and into the comfortable state of sleep and now begin to count the stars in the sky to take you into a deep sleep ten you are deeply relaxed you feel the tension melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do and you allow yourself to just be as you drift off into a comfortable sleep eight notice how you are feeling a deeper sense of relaxation you are

1 Music] hello my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this short guided meditation that will facilitate your release of any negative or limiting thoughts that no longer serve you it's time to let go of whatever has been holding you back to begin this transformative practice bring yourself to a comfortable seated position either on the floor on a bench or in a chair and wherever you find yourself straightening your spine and let your heart space open up ever so gently and allow your shoulders to drop closing your eyes when you're ready [Music] let's take a few moments now to settle in by drawing our attention to the breath [Music] and simply observe any sensations associated with each inward and each outward movement [Music] you might notice the temperature of the air as it enters your nostrils the feeling of the belly expanding and softening or a general sense of relaxation moving through your body [Music] and now with each breath that enters your lungs i invite you to envision revitalized energy mingling with your cellular body and with each breath that departs imagine any unsupportive energy being released so breathing in fresh energy full of renewed vitality and breathe out whatever is calling to be surrendered now i invite you to enter into a visual journey of transformation by imagining that you are standing at the foot of a wooded mountain beneath you your feet root into the rich soil footpath and all around evergreen trees stretch up towards the cosmos [Music] your nose picks up the scent of the pine infused aroma of these woods cleansing you from within with each full breath you take [Music] and before you the footpath weaves its way through the forest up towards the mountain's peak eager to begin this journey of transformation and release you take your first few steps in the direction of the summit above [Music] as you walk you feel life's vital energy flowing through you your body is engaged your mind is focused and your breath begins to deepen along your journey through the forest that blankets the slope of the mountain you admire the qualities you observe in this natural landscape the resilience the strength the adaptability and the beauty of the wildlife that is abundant here as you admire these qualities in the world outside of you you begin to realize that they reflect what is innately present within you too as you continue to hike towards the peak you feel this truth permeating more deeply with hours passing that feel as though they were sheer minutes the land beneath you begins to level out as the earth plateaus you make your way through the final stretch of trees before emerging onto the flat rock of this majestic mountain's peak you breathe in and release a deep sigh your jaw drops and your heart widens to the beauty of the world that extends around you valleys rivers lakes and forests down below reach out in all directions you are witnessing the world from this heightened perspective as if for the very first time and as the gentle breeze rushes against your skin you remember your intention for coming here to release what no longer serves you and to welcome the winds of change that will propel you forward and so here standing upon the mountaintop you let come to mind any and all of the negative thoughts that no longer serve you when they arise they do not stay with you for long as you surrender them up to the wind that dances through the atmosphere all around you surrender with the breath exhalation by exhalation each thought each feeling and every negative knot of energy that holds you back from realizing your true potential let the wind carry them away from you leaving you vibrantly alive [Music] allow the muscles around your eyes to relax now and your attention to land in the center of your heart and as you gaze out upon the wonder of the world above below and all around you silently set an intention to nourish yourself with positive thoughts in the minutes hours and days to come take one more long deep breath in here and when you release let go of any residual negative energy with a deep sigh let it out [Music] slowly now let the imagery of this landscape begin to fade from your mind's eye as you come back to the natural rhythm of your breathing tune into your body into the earth supporting you from below and when you are ready you can gently let the light seep back into your eyes as they slowly open [Music] and as you move through the day ahead let yourself be empowered by the transformation and release that you've experienced in this practice today allow the winds of inspired change continue to awaken and guide you many blessings you
1 [Music] hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will take you on a journey to your inner child as you encounter the child within you'll be guided into developing a more loving freeing and forgiving relationship with this aspect of self then you may previously have had my name is Jason Stephenson and thank you for joining me tonight allow your heart to open to this transformative process as you develop perhaps a new or reimagined way of relating to that child within so to begin take your time to find a comfortable resting position where you can settle in for the night ahead [Music] ensure that your spine is as straight as possible they're still relaxed and allow your limbs to rest comfortably and naturally with your eyes closed take a few moments to reconnect with your breath simply notice the way it waxes and wanes through the body soften your brow [Music] you're turning your jaw and your belly as you settle deeper into the space that holds you [Music] and see if you might allow the stomach to rise and fall to its fullest capacity with each breath with each in-breath the belly extends with ease and with each breath out it gently falls back down [Music] extending with ease as it feels and falling gently as it empties now before we take a journey to meet the inner child let us ground ourselves in compassion patience and care each one of us has a unique relationship to our inner child and sometimes it is a challenging one for this reason it is important that we establish ourselves in love before moving further so take a moment now to draw your attention to the heart space watching as the breath flows into and out of this loving center of your body you might imagine that each inhalation feeds your inner capacity for love and that each breath out softens any resistance to self-love and care and as you breathe through the heart take a few moments to reaffirm the following sentiments that will support you on your journey I am patient and gentle with myself [Music] I care for and embrace my innermost self I support myself unconditionally I am grounded in love and compassion let these words dissipate into the background as you sink into this energy of loving-kindness continue to mind the breath remembering that each inhalation fuels you and that each exhalation frees you of what is no longer required and as we move through this journey know that your experience will be as unique as you and your inner child are for some this process might be difficult know that as you move through this you are always encouraged to follow your own inner guidance so be sure to do whatever you need to do to support yourself just allow my words to guide you and remember that you can always come back to the breath to ground you [Music] before we move into this visualization let's take three deep cleansing breaths together begin by letting your last inhalation leave the body completely and then take a deep full breath in for the count of four and then slowly exhale for a count of six another deep breath in for a slow count of four and when you've reached the top slowly exhale for a count of six one last breath in for four and let it back out for six [Music] and allowing your breath to come back to its natural rhythm as you sink into the surface beneath you use your breath as an anchor whenever you need it to tether you back into this present moment now let all unnecessary tension slowly begin to dissolve into the space that supports you allow yourself to be held here unconditionally to begin this visual journey turn your attention towards your mind's eye and imagine yourself standing in a deep lush evergreen forest your feet are firmly rooted in a pressed Earth pathway that weaves through the trees and all around you majestic aspen spruce and pine trees climb up into the clear blue sky [Music] your spine is straight your chest is open and your shoulders are relaxed and as you breathe you do so deeply welcoming the cleansing pine infused air into the depths of your lungs you exhale with a soft sigh letting go of anything that does not serve you here [Music] take three full deep breaths at your own pace now letting the crisp and clean forest air cleanse mind body and soul you [Music] and after your third deep breath you begin your journey ahead step-by-step you make your way through the enchanted forest that holds you the air is a comfortable temperature keeping you both warm and refreshed observe the colors and textures that fill your eyesight as you pass through this landscape what shapes do the trees take what hues appear in the leaves the trunks of the trees and any other plant life that thrives here [Music] what richness and diversity is apparent to you [Music] the further you venture the more settled you feel this flourishing ecosystem holds you as one of its own leading you gently onwards down your own path of healing it's not long before there is a break in the trees and you step out of the woods upon the site of a magnificent shimmering lake your shoulders drop even further from your ears as your soul is stirred by this body of water you approach the water's edge slowly inching your way towards the rocky shoreline that surrounds it the still water loves you right up to its edge and so you take a seat on the smooth rock face overlooking the water to rest for a while [Music] [Music] the Sun inches its way towards the treeline inviting a car and wrested energy to the fading day the wind is barely traceable and the flat water sparkles beneath the Setting Sun all is well as you gaze across the water you realize you feel deeply content in this space and time there is nothing missing from this moment and yet your heart is wide open to whatever might come your way you feel strong stable and secure in who and where you are remaining seated here something draws your attention down the shore that leads into the Setting Sun some distance away you notice someone making their way towards you it is a young person perhaps five or six years of age though their exact age is entirely up to you this individual slowly makes their way closer and closer to you until soon you realize that the person approaching is you it is you from some many years ago it is the child within the child that has always kept some space within you [Music] they're returning to you and you to them [Music] take a moment to fully notice this child let your heart be completely open to their presence regardless of how they've shown up today [Music] [Music] this child moves carefully and as they come within a few meters distance you offer a few words of kindness and invite them to come and sit next to you knowing they're safe in this visualization they come to take a seat in front of you you begin this interaction simply by extending the warmth of your heart onto this small person before you grounded in a wisdom and self compassion that they have yet to develop you hold this energy for them simply through your presence you offer them your unconditional acceptance [Music] meeting their eyes you take in the heart and soul of this child and you ask them if there is anything on their heart or mind [Music] leave plenty of space for what arises and if or as they speak listen without judgment simply hold space but whatever it is they are feeling know also that it is okay if they do not have any words to say your inner child may speak through nonverbal language and in the face of whatever arises whether that be fear joy anger grief guilt playfulness or anything else you offer them your love you offer this child your compassion without expectation and without condition let yourself be there Rock as steady as the physical rock beneath you you nurture them in whatever way feels most comfortable for the two of you perhaps that is through a big hug or through hands held tightly or perhaps it is simply through holding the space for one another know that there is no right or wrong way to nurture your inner child here [Music] [Music] and then ask your inner child if there is something they'd like your help with is there something they'd like you to set free for them is there something they would like you to forgive [Music] let this child know that they have your unconditional support in releasing anything that does not serve their sense of happiness and wholeness you as their wise elder can offer them the love support and forgiveness that they've been yearning for [Music] and now in the silent space that holds you both next to the lake you might silently repeat to them I see you I hear you I love you I am here for you I support you I forgive you I honor you I embrace you I free you take some more time now to fully embrace this in a child through your loving presence through hands held or through a warm and caring hug let this child be held by your love and by your strength [Music] let this child take the time they need to feel as they feel reminding them that you are not here to change them you are simply here to listen and to support [Music] and as they feel heard the inner world begins to quiet as does your own soon the two of you sit peacefully and contently gazing out over the calm waters of the lake at dusk [Music] The Sun has disappeared behind the trees and a warm orange glow stretches across the horizon the sky above is ocean blue slowly deepening its turn as the day fades away you and your inner child look towards one another and smile you were grateful for this moment and for this opportunity to reconnect [Music] you and as the colors of the sky signal that it is almost time for slumber you ask your inner child where they like to rest for the night perhaps they yearn to go to bed in a place from your shared past perhaps they longed to slumber beneath the open starry sky or perhaps they would find the most peace the most happiness falling asleep in some imagined land that inspires them wherever your inner child finds peace and comfort let them know you will guide them there [Music] and then slowly slowly letting the landscape in your mind transform call to mind the place where they know they will rest with the most ease [Music] imagine what this place looks like and what comforts it holds wherever you find yourself invite your inner child to settle into a cozy and comfortable bed for the night you tuck them in with love and care reminding them that you are always here for them and as they surrender into the night you whisper the words I love you I am here for you I love you I am here for you I [Music] love you [Music] I am here for you [Music] spend a few more silent moments whispering these words to your inner child perhaps aligning the words I love you with your inhalations and I'm here for you with your exhalations the inner child drifts off to sleep and you are left with the revitalized sense of love and care for this part of yourself you set an intention now that when the signs of this inner child arise in you in the future you will tend to them with unconditional patience presence love and compassion [Music] now you two are ready to surrender into sleep and so you come back to your body letting the evenings visualizations gently begin to dissipate [Music] notice the felt sense of your body being supported by the bed or other surface beneath you what does it feel like to be held here [Music] notice the breath as it flows through you creating an expansion and a softening with each full cycle and then draw your attention to the heart space once again connecting with the center of your compassion for one last time before drifting into sleep [Music] and as you hold your attention here imagine a small white light beginning to appear in the center of your chest it expands outwards with each second that goes by and as it permeates through your body it offers its a loving energy to each cell that it passes [Music] soon your entire body is held in this healing white light arising from within it nurtures every part of you the present self the past self and the future self all at the same time [Music] spend just a few more moments now feeling yourself as you were bathed in this warm glow [Music] and when you were ready slowly let that light dissipate come back to the felt sense of your body in this space let yourself connect intimately with the earth that supports you here and then let your attention come back to the breath noting this natural movement as it passes through you if there is anything else that needs to be released let it out now with a deep sigh [Music] allow your breath to be an anchor for your awareness as you slowly drift into slumber sleep well my friend sleep well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 hello this is Sara Raymond with the mindful movement welcome to this guided sleep meditation to help you prepare for a deep and relaxing night's sleep we will also focus on inviting in abundance to your life first I will guide you through a complete body and mind relaxation that will bring about a sense of calmness and allow your subconscious mind to let go of anything blocking the flow of abundance to you then you will hear suggestions to invite abundance into your life in any way that you desire the mindset of abundance is the opposite of scarcity abundance is the overflowing and over sufficient quantity of that which you desire and you have the power to invite it into your life what you are thinking about right before you fall asleep will set the tone for the quality of your sleep and your mindset for the next day you have the choice to change the way that you look at things before we get started make sure you are ready to drift off to sleep if you like when this recording is over if you like the relaxing benefits of lavender oil and happen to have some you can rub some on your temples or your pulse points or perhaps diffuse it into the air or spray a light mist on your pillow make your environment as dark and relaxing as possible take a moment now to turn off all distractions and pause this recording if there's anything you need to prepare yourself for a safe and comfortable night's sleep know that you are safe and supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you choose to do so now that you have prepared your surroundings welcome a sense of relaxation and peace into your mind and body invite it in as if you are welcoming an old friend as we begin allow your eyes to close gently and focus your attention on your breath by simply being mindful and intentional with your breath your body sends a signal to your brain that you are safe and can move into rest and digest mode now begin to deepen your breath take a full breath in to fill up from your belly up to your ribs and into your chest and hold your breath for just a moment [Music] and let out your breath gently allowing any physical and emotional tension to leave your body with your exhale again take another deep breath hold it for a short moment and this time take your time with the exhale slowing it down so that it lasts just a little longer than the inhale take the next few moments to mindfully breathe in this way encouraging each exhale to be just a bit longer than the inhale to signal the body to relax each breath cycle allow the exhale to slow down a little more than the breath before it and feel your body soften and your thoughts slow down even more with each slow deep breath now release that breath pattern and allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and flow notice how you were feeling while you're short and focused breath practice has slowed your heart rate it has quieted your mind it has brought about a heavy sense of calm to your physical body [Music] notice the natural rhythm of your breath and feel the sensations that accompany your breath perhaps you feel a slightly cool sensation as the air passes through your nostrils maybe you feel a floating sensation as your abdomen and chest rise and fill with breath or a heaviness as the air moves out of your body taking any tension with it maybe the breath brings a warming sensation to the body as it travels along its path whatever you're feeling is perfect simply observe the process this process of relaxation is not about what you are feeling but that you are being curious and looking [Music] as you continue to attend to the sensations in the body associated with your breath let go of distractions let go of your responsibilities let go of expectations of what you think this experience should be and surrender to the process of relaxation simply notice what you are feeling without changing or judging just notice invite in the feeling of peace as you tune out the whole world around you and go within with my voice as a soothing guide to help you move towards sleep in a moment now I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the top of your head moving all the way down through your feet as I say each part of your body see that part in your mind's eye and you can relax that body part completely [Music] welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind encourage the weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface below you so that there is no need to hold on you can simply let go into sleep there is no need to follow my voice for the entire recording your subconscious mind will hear me as you drift into sleep now as we begin to scan the body bring your attention to the top of your head intend to feel this area from the inside of your body as sensations only without moving your eyes as you scan your body simply move your awareness to each part and you will relax that body part completely let's begin this relaxation process with the scalp welcoming ease into the forehead and eyes allow the release of any facial expression to soften the lines of your face relax the tiny muscles around your eyes and feel as your eyelids become heavy allow your cheeks to soften your jaw to unclench and your neck to relax completely as each muscle relaxants in progression it invites a deeper sense of relaxation to the parts of your body that came before in our body scan continuing this cumulative relaxation process as you invite a sense of peace and stillness to your shoulders chest and arms perhaps feeling a relaxed heaviness move into your ribs abdomen and back let go of any gripping in your hips as your thighs rest heavy on the surface below you as if there is no difference between where you end and where the surface below you begins you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part allows it to relax and let go finally since your ankles and feet releasing and relaxing completely [Music] take another moment to slowly scan your body once more this time notice any areas that may still be holding on to any lingering tension and ask your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe and supported and knows exactly what to do to relax if you simply allow the tension to release now they were fully relaxed I will guide you on a journey this journey will take you on a path to release any negative beliefs or ideas that could be holding you back from the abundance you desire then you will bring in the energy of abundance into the space you create for it when you let go of fears I invite you to open your imagination and step into a field of beautiful wildflowers look around at this field of wildflowers as you stand on a path that leads you right down the center of the field here you are surrounded on both sides by flowers and the most vivid colors use your senses to take in this beautiful and peaceful environment around you see the clear bright sky above you feel that the temperature of the air is perfect just for you and the Sun shines on you gently warming your skin the faint smell of the flowers is just right for your liking perhaps you hear birds chirping in the distance or see butterflies flitting around as you look around you can see many beautiful colors in all directions around you you sense that you are safe and peaceful in this place in your imagination that is just right for you [Music] you begin to walk along this path down the center of the field moving towards some rolling hills where you see even more wildflowers as you walk you have a feeling that you are carrying around something extra something weighing you down something making you feel heavy and tired you reach into your pockets and feel that surprisingly there are some smooth stones there these stones that you are carrying around weighing you down [Music] represent your fears and your feelings of not enough they represent anything known or unknown to you that is holding you back each stone is something that is blocking the flow of abundance to you slowly take one stone out of your pocket and leave it on the path behind you as you continue walking forwards feel that a space has opened up inside of you as you let go of something negative in your life there's no need to label what you are letting go of simply let go knowing that it's something that no longer serves you or support your goals and desires for abundance continue to do the same with each of the remaining stones in your pocket one at a time take your time and feel the energetic shift from negative to positive feel the space you have opened up for the flow of abundance now that you have let go of that which no longer serves you you have made room for the flow of abundance invited in letting go of resistance gives way to an attitude of allowing allow in positive energy thoughts and beliefs allow in gratitude love and abundance feel this flow of positive energy within you and it is magnetically attracted back to you take a moment and sense this energy and positive feeling [Music] as you look around at the field of flowers now you can see possibilities and abundance everywhere you look each of the flowers around you grow from a seed each seed had everything it needed within it to become the flower that it is and each flower has the seeds to become many more flowers and on and on the cycle goes much like these flowers grown from seeds you to have everything you need within you to have the life of your dreams and to attract the abundance in your life that you desire the abundance of the flowers around you represents abundance in your life now call to mind a part of your life that you would like to see a flow of abundance visualize this component of your life exactly as you want it to be feel how it would feel as if this was already true for you soak in the feelings in this present moment the things you think about right before drifting off to sleep color your thoughts as you sleep and for the day ahead in a moment I will guide your subconscious with some positive affirmation statements inviting the flow of abundance into your life there is no need to repeat these if you are so relaxed you are almost sleeping your subconscious will hear them simply believe they are true I acknowledge the positive things in my life I expressed the feeling of gratitude often for the blessings in my life I love myself and believe I am worthy of abundance to flow to me I allow the flow of abundance in all aspects of my life I attract success and abundance I radiate out positive loving energy and that is what comes back to me I take action towards my goals of abundance every day I let go of negative influences and energies that do not serve me I know that abundance is unlimited and that my abundance will benefit others I am generous and give my unique gifts to the world and now you have prepared your mind in your body for a deep and restful night's sleep your subconscious mind is open to allow the flow of abundance to you you're a relaxed and feel a sense of lightness and spaciousness as you have let go of anything weighing you down sleep is inviting you to let go and surrender to your dreams allow this to happen if you wish take the final steps into a deep and restful slumber as you drift off into a dreaming sleep you will continue to radiate out love and positive energy and attract it back to you your body knows exactly what to do to relax and allow abundance during your very

1 welcome this guided meditation is to help you sue the feelings of anxiety before bed so that you can fall asleep easily and have a peaceful night's sleep meditation before bed is a wonderful way to quiet the racing thoughts and to get ready for the day or week ahead please do not use this as a substitute for seeking the advice of a medical professional if necessary the mind is a complex process sometimes we find ourselves overwhelmed by where our mind can take us ideally as we become more self-aware through our practice we learn how to use our mind as a tool many of us have difficulty with this concept or have not yet begun that path when our mind uses us instead it can lead us in various directions when this happens we are subject to the reactions we may have to our thoughts and our life situations this is often what triggers feelings of anxiety when our mind takes us to future moments we can feel worried or even panic over what's to come anxiety is on some level living in the future nothing ever happens in the future though everything happens in the present moment getting in touch with the present moment and the timeless beauty of the now and accepting it fully with love and non judgment that is where the answer to anxiety lies many people deal with feelings of anxiety on a regular basis understanding some of the details on a basic level can help set your path towards an anxiety free life first of all anxiety cannot hurt you even though it might feel otherwise in the moment it is important to recognize this it is basically a shift in activity in the brain from one area to another it may create physical symptoms that appear at times quite severe it can even replicate feeling similar to a real physical concern being able to recognize these feelings for what they are just a temporary shift towards the sympathetic nervous system also known as the fight-or-flight response is a powerful step towards healing [Music] once we understand and truly believe that these feelings no matter how powerful can do us no harm we can accept them without judgment in fact as an observer of our bodies we want to welcome these feelings oftentimes it's the fear of anxiety that triggers further anxious sensations if we truly do not fear them they will begin to dissolve welcome them as The Watcher of your body as if you are expecting these feelings see these feelings as a teaching tool as though you are completely okay with them smile at them smile with every cell in your body and as your love shines its light the darkness will fade oftentimes this anxiety creeps up around bedtime when we begin to consider what's in store for the next day or the week ahead it is the idea of living in the future today I will invite you into your present moment to let go of the past and have confidence in what the future holds I will guide you to attend to your breath and your physical sensations in this present moment with this practice you can peacefully drift off to sleep take a moment and make sure you are in a safe place to drift off to sleep if you choose if you need to pause this video that's okay [Music] make sure your room is dark and you are very comfortable if you are listening to this on an electronic device turn the screens light away from you create the most comfortable environment that you can [Music] once you are ready to begin the journey to sleep bring your attention to your breath and invite the feeling of settling into your space knowing you are exactly where you need to be I'm going to count to three and then I would like you to take a deep breath in through your nose and as you exhale gently close your eyes and soften your body one two three [Music] let's repeat that cycle two more times gently open your eyes one two three breathe in deeply and relax on your exhale letting your eyes close one more time softly open your eyes one two three breathe in deep and relax letting your eyes shut down and your whole body relaxed and with your eyes closed now allow your breath to become natural [Music] knowing that the body knows what to do to breathe to relax and to recover and rejuvenate while you sleep and now simply be aware of the sensations in your body that are associated with the natural rhythm of your breath [Music] notice the cool air of the passes into your nostrils and how the air is a little warmer as it flows out of your body feel as the chest and belly rise and fall and rhythm with the breath [Music] as you continue breathing naturally begin to sense the pause that occurs between the exhale and the next inhale keep your attention on this momentary pause for the next few breaths using this pause to come back to each present moment use this pause to let go of the worry about the future to let go of the need for perfection to let go of the shoulds [Music] if your attention drifts away from your breath which it likely will noticing a sound or a thought or a physical sensation lovingly return your attention to the next breath and the next pause continue focusing on your breath as you invite your body to soften and reacts each natural exhale takes you deeper into relaxation and closer to peaceful sleep allow yourself to let go of all the stress from your day let go of your to-do list for the future and now gently move your attention to your body first focus your attention on your face as you exhale let go of all the muscles of your face [Music] relax your forehead relax the tiny muscles around your eyes and your cheeks unclench your jaw and think into the surface below you continue to watch your breath as you let go of the muscles in your neck and your shoulders [Music] relax your arms relax your back [Music] let go of all of the muscles in your belly and your hips let go of any tension in your legs invite the sensation of relaxation to let everything go you are now very relaxed you are feeling very comfortable and you are enjoying a sense of inner peace that is soothing and quieting your mind slowly complete one more scan of your body sensations from your head all the way down throughout your entire body and as you do breathe deeply into any areas of remaining tension to completely let go [Music] inviting your body to go deeper into relaxation you now I would like you to imagine watching yourself as an observer outside of your own body imagine yourself in a place where you have known to have the sense of anxiety in the past maybe it's at work or at home or possibly in a social situation I would like you to see yourself going through your day when you begin to notice these unwanted feelings coming on as the observer notice that you are not these feelings one moment you can see yourself happy and content then you can see yourself noticing these sensations bubbling up from inside it's okay these anxious feelings are there but everything is okay continue to watch yourself and watch these sensations welcome them they will not harm you you are not these feelings they are just something you're experiencing and it's okay you can see yourself feeling these feelings and you can see that you are okay with them now watch yourself embrace these feelings embrace them with open arms it is okay feel all that they are watch yourself embrace them welcome them with love welcome them with unconditional love for yourself knowing that the universe would not

choose to call upon the feelings anytime you can create any life you want your dreams are within your grasp when you choose to reach connect with what is showing up for you now breathe it in remain connected with the positive excited state of this visualization stay connected with the building energy of possibilities for the future and at the same time become aware of what you want and why you

head going all the way down through your body to your feet as you see each part of your body in your mind's eye give yourself permission to relax that body part completely and as you move your attention throughout your body scan for any areas of tension tightness or pain to be released if there are areas of tension allow your focus to linger on that part of your body and breathe in warm healing light right into this area to soften it lovingly ask your body to relax and release [Music] as you continue scanning your body feel this relaxing and healing energy move through you as it takes you deeper and deeper into a safe and supported state of sleep and recovery and now let's begin the slow process of relaxing your entire body as you prepare for a deep healing night's sleep let your attention move to the top of your head as you become aware of this area kindly ask your body who are a release from your scalp and head feel your forehead soften and smooth notice the tiny muscles around your eyebrows and eyes relaxing completely you can allow the tension from the day to dissolve from your face feel your eyelids becoming very heavy unclench your jaw and relax your tongue [Music] this softening of your face and jaw will send a signal to the rest of your body and will deepen the state of relaxation [Music] let your attention move to your throat and since a softening or an opening here you might notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper allow this wave of comfort to continue its journey down your body let your scanning attention move now to your chest and shoulders as you feel a release allowing you to rest heavy every breath in brings healing air into your belly and allows your abdomen to let go even

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will focus on inner clearing forgiveness and the Hawaiian prayer our pono pono my name is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to gently open your heart as you move with me through this deeply healing and restorative practice and closing your eyes if you've not done so then explore what it feels like to fully arrive here and to arrive in this sense means simply to let your mind join your body to set aside for the time being any notions about the past or the future you can help your mind to arrive here by tuning into the surface beneath your body or by holding your entire being in open awareness establishing this sense of presence will anchor you as you journey through this practice of clearing away any past mistakes wrongdoings and resentments because as we surrender into this moment it becomes more natural to surrender any inner workings that prevent us from living in the name of love patience forgiveness and understanding now let your attention land on the breaths flow if it's not already there and simply mind this natural movement of lifeforce as you ground into this practice for a few more moments a few more breaths [Music] let each inhalation create an inner expansion and each exhalation and inner softening [Music] the Hawaiian prayer our pono pono is a practice of healing and clearing through forgiveness translated this term can be understood to mean to make right or to correct some definitions even refer to it as a mental and emotional cleansing during this practice we will explore the power of forgiveness by first easing the physical body and then moving into a guided visualization for a deeper level of mental and emotional clearing we will finish this practice with a repeated ho'oponopono mantra as you gently surrender into a good night's sleep so I invite you now to take a moment to come back to the physical body simply noting what it is like to be in the present space that you occupy and as you are guided through the physical body I invite you to bring your loving awareness to each area that we pass as you inhale into each corner of the body bring a healing white light or a sense of love to that area and as you exhale let it soften into the present moment so beginning now at your toes holding them in your full awareness breathe loving energy into these parts of you sending the breath all the way down and then exhale to let any tension here dissipate and moving up now to your ankles breathing in deeply down into your ankles and releasing your calves and shins sending the breath down and releasing softening moving up to your knees breathing in breathing out your thighs and your hamstrings [Music] and shifting the focus to your pelvis and your hips breathing in and on the breath out softening your belly and your lower back [Music] and then moving up to your spy into your chest and your upper back [Music] now draw your attention to your fingertips breathing light or love into your entire hands and releasing on the out-breath continuing with your wrists your lower arms your elbows [Music] moving up to your upper arms breathing in breathing out and release and your shoulders breathing in loving energy into your throat area and soften as you exhale continue with your jaw and your mouth [Music] your cheeks ears and nose you your third eye area between your two eyebrows [Music] and then finish by breathing this way into the crown of your head hold your entire body in your awareness now for a few more grounding breaths before we move deeper into this process of clearing you might imagine that your entire body is being bathed in a white light one that frees you of any inhibiting physical tension and then gently let that white light dissipate in your own time now this will be a journey of clearing and forgiveness and while on the other side of these processes is deep peace and love the journey itself may be challenging for some depending upon how you find yourself in this moment offering yourself or others forgiveness may cause difficult emotions to arise if this turns out to be the case for you tonight remember that you can always come back to your breath or your body to ground yourself let your heart journey as deep as it is meant to be in this moment knowing that you are universally supported so take a moment to find yourself standing outside of a home or cabin that feels safe comfortable and welcoming to you it might be a home that you know or one that the mind creates in either case observe what its exterior looks like what is it made of what is the surrounding environment like what about this abode that warms the heart and soul take a few moments to cultivate an image of this home in your mind letting it bring you a sense of safety and peace [Music] this home has shown up view today to serve as a symbol for coming home to yourself it represents a return to the love support and care that is within you and so before you make your way inside take a moment to set an intention to love care for and support yourself unconditionally and now as you reach your hand for the door handle you slowly turn pull and make your way inside standing in the front hallway you feel an immense sense of relief and gratitude wash over you the home is exactly what you imagined it would be when you stood outside of it a sanctuary full of love light and beauty that also lives at the very core of your being take a moment to imagine what this hallway looks like what colors are its walls what details and accents does it boast what artwork adorns it now you slowly walk down the drifting main hallway soon arriving in a living space that is warm at ease and full of soul and charm it contains details both large and small that bring you a sense of coming home to yourself this room is a perfect reflection of who you are at your loving core take a few moments now to paint in your mind's eye [Music] notice the windows the light and the energy that this room holds imagine now that alongside one wall of this room is a mirror tall and wide it reflects back the entire room into the onlookers eyes depending upon what angle it is approached at something about this mirror is mesmerizing and then you notice that just in front of it cushions and blankets rest as if it's been waiting for you slowly and mindfully you make your way over to this little oasis within the soulful room you've designed taking a seat upon the blankets and cushions presented here you settle in straightening the spine as much as comfortable and letting the shoulders relaxed your jaw softens as does your forehead and belly and then you meet your own eyes in the shimmering mirror as you stare into your own reflection take a moment to simulate a knee ously hold your heart in your awareness let the loving compassionate energy of your heart be the source of the healing or clearing that is possible here and as you hold your own gaze in this mirror you sense that you are returning to yourself how long you wonder has it been since you've been this lovingly attuned to your own inner reflection and yet while love is indeed present here you might find that limiting judgements about who you are or where you've been come up to the surface because sometimes when we attempt to love cherish or accept ourselves the mind rises with its whispers of resistance often these inner judgmental whispers are subtle and yet they can have such a strong effect on how much love forgiveness and kindness we are able to grant ourselves [Music] so in order to clear whatever stories thoughts or beliefs that may be holding you back from unconditional self-acceptance and reconciliation with your true self you look at yourself in the mirror as you slowly repeat these words I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you [Music] I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you spend some time now on your own in silence cultivating these words and an energy of deep care and consideration for yourself as you whisper these words I love you I'm sorry please forgive me and thank you invisible knots of resentment judgment and wrongdoing begin to untangle themselves from your body your body becomes lighter your mind becomes freer and your heart becomes more loving [Music] whatever you may hold against yourself and whatever you may have done in the past does not define who you really are beneath the wise and loving energy of forgiveness you are able to clear yourself you repeat these affirmations three more times now each I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you [Music] I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me [Music] thank you [Music] now the words dissipate into the atmosphere around you as you come back to the quiet space with him you meet your reflection in the mirror once again feeling a wave of gratitude washed through you you are grateful for the energies of love kindness and forgiveness is showing up today and you are grateful for this return to yourself for this inner reconciliation if you need some more time to connect with your loving center imagine yourself resting a hand upon your heart and breathing into that space each inhalation brings a wave of self-love and each exhalation frees you from the entanglement of judgment resentment and the past you take one last look in the mirror and then you turn away from it and back towards the beautiful room that holds you and as you rest here grounded in both the earth and in your heart take a moment to consider if there is anyone you might like to offer this loving forgiving and clearing energy to [Music] when you feel ready to simply offer to any individuals or to the universe at large the loving-kindness that has cleared you here tonight and when you were ready come back to your breath and to the homey room that supports you [Music] take three full deep breaths in your own timing now surrendering any residual tension with a sigh as needed [Music] [Music] let your breath resume its natural rhythm after that third deep breath [Music] and within the image of this inner sanctuary envision yourself coming to curl up on the floor or a couch within this room envision yourself fully supported by cushions and blankets and then gently close your eyes on even this visualization as you come back to your body and to the reality that holds you know that the energies you cultivated in this sacred home are now embedded within you as you drift into sleep they were strengthened their roots so that you will soon embody their wisdom in each and every cell of your being allow your body to melt taking a brief moment to notice if there is any tension that might like to be released or any adjustments that need to be made and as you surrender into this space that hold you allow this Hawaiian prayer to continue clearing your inner world of that which no longer serves you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me [Music] thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry [Music] please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you [Music] I'm sorry [Music] please forgive me thank you I love you [Music] I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I'm sorry please forgive me I love you I'm sorry please forgive me I love I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] hello this is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation designed to help you release what you've been holding on to and to help ease you into a deep and restorative night's sleep the intention behind this meditation is to help you to let go of that which you have been clinging on to surrendering it to a higher force through this process of letting go you're free up misplaced energy finding a greater sense of lightness freedom and pure state of being this mysterious and often misunderstood force to which your surrender may feel or sound like the word God or universal energy or consciousness or it may be by some other name that is comfortable and familiar to you you may even choose to leave it unnamed whatever the case this idea of a force simply points towards the energy that makes all of this life possible whatever term or non term becomes your guiding force for this meditation is entirely welcomed and accepted this energy will be the bed that nourishes you throughout the duration of this meditation and all the way into your sleep this recording is designed to be an anchor before bedtime for a consecutive 21 days over the course of these three weeks you will be repeatedly guided to let go of that which no longer serves you allowing the transformative powers of some higher force to nurture hold and awaken every level of your being before we begin I invite you now to ensure that all end of day activities are taken care of lights are switched off ringers are silenced and blinds are drawn make your way into a comfortable lying down position using any cushions and blankets required to support you through this transformative journey and then into a deep and restful sleep make any adjustments necessary allowing your body to begin the process of relaxation feeling yourself sink a little bit further into the surface that support you throughout this journey as is the case with any meditation you may experience rising emotions or other challenging sensations if these waves come to you know that is safe to feel into them allow the space that holds you the air that surrounds you and the force that lives within you to carry you through whatever arises just surrender these energies to the higher power that supports all of life note that each day of this meditation will be set against a different emotional backdrop know that from day to day this meditation will feel and look unique as you process it in your own natural way know that whatever arises is entirely okay and that whatever comes up is in fact required to be seen in order for you to move through it and finally know that you are unconditionally supported through this journey [Music] take a moment now to connect with your breath without attempting to change it in any way simply notice its natural rhythm in this very moment [Music] notice the way that without any action on your part the breaths innate wisdom guides itself into the body gently and back out to the world around you allow your breath to be your anchor into the present moment throughout this process of letting go for a few breaths now bring your awareness to your belly simply observe this part of the body and notice that wherever your attention flows the breath goes to witness the natural rise and fall of the stomach with each inhalation and each exhalation notice the body becoming more relaxed with each deep breath taken and feel that sinking further into this space that support you take a moment to bring awareness to the truth that just by being here in this very moment you are already beginning the process of releasing by allowing the body to rest deeply into this present moment you are immersed within the journey of releasing limited notions that have been carried for quite some time with your attention turn towards each breath you are continuously being grounded into the present moment surrendering your thoughts to that which exists all around you to cosmic energy to the source of all life throughout this meditation your mind may become subject to wondering if this is the case in any moment simply observe this tendency of the mind to lose its focus to wander into the past or into the future and into deeply entrenched beliefs about yourself or about life in general and know that this movement is entirely natural observe each mental shift away from the present moment with compassion and non judgment as humans with the capacity for self consciousness it is entirely natural for the mind to wander now if it's here and not to reject or deny these movements but to simply observe them and then to guide awareness back to the breath or some other anchor to the present moment [Music] with each mental meandering that arises simply witness it and then guide your attention back to your breath or to the sound of my voice take a few moments here to gently follow the breath allowing it to guide you further into this present moment releasing any mental notions of the past present or future simply allow yourself to be right here right now [Music] letting go requires a complete surrender of our mental energy often this process brings up uncomfortable sensations and deep feelings of fear whatever we have been holding on to has become interwoven with our experience and expectation of happiness letting go requires us to surrender into the deep and knowing that even without whatever beliefs ideas people or objects we have been clinging to we are entirely whole entirely loved and entirely free our attempts to control the world around us are born out of fear fear that we may not receive enough love or money or safety or nourishment or anything else for that matter through exerting control we often believe that we can ensure that our future will play out the way we hope for it to letting go of this belief requires a leap of faith a leap into knowing that everything we require will be provided by this cosmic force greater than us take a moment once again to tune in to the breath acknowledging any sensations feelings or emotions that may be rising simply witness these uprisings if they present themselves as passing waves that do not belong to you allow them to come and allow them to go without fixating on any mental ideas about what they are why they are there or what their purpose is simply observe them without thought without judgment and with unconditional acceptance and compassion the act of surrender requires what may feel like a courageous leap into the unknown and yet on the other side of this leap is the sensation of freedom by letting go of our attempts to control or to manipulate the world around us we release vast stores of energy this energy does not disappear from us but instead repurposes itself energy that was once tied up in fear becomes energy intertwined with love trust and peace take a moment now to come into the body due to the intricate interconnection of mind and body we can help to ease the mind and support its surrender through release and relaxation of the body just continue to follow my voice as we journey now through the body with each body part mentioned allow your attention to flow there allow each area to be infused with breath with warmth and with love allow each area to release any tension it may be carrying begin by drawing your awareness to your toes gently feeling into them softening them with your awareness [Music] regarde and release now both feet [Music] the ankles the lower legs softening your knees [Music] and your upper legs witnessin release any remaining tension within the entirety of both legs now draw your attention to and relax the buttocks pelvis your hips release now your belly softening let go [Music] you'll lower back and gently move up the spine to soften the entirety of the back allow the chest to soften and the heart to relax [Music] draw your awareness upwards along both arms beginning at the tips of your fingers slowly softening each part of the arm along your journey upwards when you arrive at the shoulders take a moment to witness and relax both shoulders and the entirety of both your arms soften now the Nick both front and back release any tension in the jaw the mouth your cheeks knows your ears and your eyes and the eye sockets soften the eyebrows and the phorid and then witness and relax the top of the head the back of your head relaxing and now your entire head gently softening letting go take a moment now to observe the whole body feeling it melt into the surface beneath it and as the body relaxes more deeply notice how the mind follows take a few deep breaths you allowing both body and mind to continue sinking into the universal energy that supports them as you continue your personal journey of letting go know that you are deeply supported by the higher force that exists around and within you this all-knowing and ever-present energetic force is a safe loving and supportive container capable of holding and transforming all mental beliefs stories and attachments this divine energy and its support can be called upon at any point to assist with your individual process take a moment now to bring your awareness to the heart space [Music] it may be helpful to slowly envision the mind descending melting into the non thinking space of your heart begin now to breathe from the heart allowing it to expand on each inhalation and soften on each exhalation [Music] through the heart we are better able to recognize our connection to this oneness that supports all of life by allowing your mind to descend and melt away we begin to operate from the hearts knowing from this deep faith and trust in the universe through the heart we operate from a knowing that there is no need to control the world around us and there is no need to latch on to anything we begin to feel into the safety and support that is always present and available to us as you slowly edge further towards sleep allow your breath to rock you into a deeply transformative state of relaxation where this surrendering process will continue each breath guides you back to the present moment each mindful breath is an act of surrender by releasing any mental beliefs we carry we allow ourselves to come further into the body into the breath and into the feeling of this present moment by releasing the stories of our past and the beliefs about our present and our future we break overly used energy patterns so that we may repurpose our energetic stores the use by our highest and most divinely connected selves feel into the

1 hello and welcome to this short guided meditation that will help you to relax deeply as you release and transform any troubles you are experiencing with the help of the ocean's waves my name is jason stevenson and i invite you to open your heart and mind to this transformative practice let the top of your head stretch up towards the ceiling and your shoulders to soften towards the earth eyes closed and turn your attention inwards as you observe the gentle rhythm of your breathing and as you watch the breath flow into and out of your lungs notice how it resembles the steady flow of waves against a sandy beach in this moment your body is the shore and the breath is the ebb and flow of nature's mysterious force take a few moments to let the breath naturally guide you into a deeper state of relaxation just as the ocean's waves tend to lull us into a place of peace and tranquility soften your belly as you breathe and relax your shoulders seeing if the breath might like to move a bit deeper into your body you don't need to force anything simply observe the rhythm that is present and now i invite you to turn your attention towards the mind's eye to the seat of your capacity for inspired visualization and from within this space i invite you to imagine that you were standing firmly grounded on a warm tropical beach the ocean just a dozen meters ahead of you sparkles beneath the beaming sun soft waves crash gently against the steady shore forever flowing back out to the vastness from which they came the air is a comfortable temperature warming each cell bone and corner of your soul you look left and right realizing that no one is here but you this healing space is all yours to enjoy in peace and tranquility so take a moment to ground yourself by feeling the soles of your feet against the multitude of grains of sand beneath you the warmth from this surface permeates up through your legs your pelvis running up the length of your spine and then expanding outwards through your arms and up to the crown of your head you tilt your head gently as your face extends towards the sun and you begin to feel any weight you've been carrying melt from your body take a long deep breath in and out and slowly you make your way closer towards the water's edge you pause just a few meters away from it and settle yourself into the sand coming to a seated position feel into the sensation of the warm sandy surface embracing each inch of your skin that comes into contact with it as you sink into this unfolding moment you begin to surrender any barriers that exist within you to experience deep peace and relaxation you know that in this moment there is nothing you need to do nothing you need to accomplish and nothing you need to be you know that you are enough as you are and that this moment is enough as it is and as you watch the luminous waves crashing against the sandy shore just before you you offer up to these transformative waters any troubles you've been experiencing lately all limitation or challenging thoughts feelings emotions and stories leave your body with each breath out and as the energy of these thoughts and feelings flow through the breeze towards the ocean you watch as they are swept away for healing and transformation as each wave rushes back into the ocean abyss take some time consciously offer up anything you might like to release to these cleansing waters watch all of your troubles be washed gracefully away and when you were ready take a moment to come back to the simple beauty of this relaxing space to the sounds of the wondrous waves to the nourishment of each cleansing breath and to the warm glow of the soothing sun allow yourself to relax upon this serene beach for just a few more silent breaths slowly now let the imagery of this tranquil landscape dissolve as you take three deep and grounding breaths on your own rhythm and after that last long exhale let your breath return to its natural cycle and when you feel ready to come back to the world around you slowly open your eyes you might want to spend some time here just over the next five minutes listening to the sounds of the waves as you slowly come back let the relaxing energy of this beach move you through the day ahead or the evening tapping into your inner source of peace and release again and again you  English (auto-generated)

move inward to rest easily on your breath notice the air as it moves in and out through your nose feel your breath from within as it comes in and as it goes out like an ocean wave rolling into the shore and back out again your attention on the wave of your breath will aid in deepening your peaceful state and allow sleep to easily come to you without any effort and now encouraging your breath to support your relaxation even further after your next exhale begin to breathe in more deeply directing your breath into your belly pause for a moment at the top exhale fully and slowly then pause again following your exhale again take a deep breath in filling your belly hold at the top for a moment then slowly breathe out sensing your belly soften after you exhale hold for just a second and then begin again continue to breathe in this way for a few more breath cycles on your own letting each inhalation and each exhalation be slow and full you may notice your belly rise and fall with each cycle while there are many things in life that you don't have control over your breath is one aspect that you can direct a bit become aware of your physical body notice any areas that may be holding on to tension unintentionally whatever part of you draws your focus most prominently allow your attention to linger here and welcome a softening into this part of your body perhaps you're noticing some tension releasing from the small muscles around your eyes or in the area of your neck and shoulders or maybe you are able to release your belly and back as you allow your attention to flow throughout your body easily and effortlessly in this moment you can surrender more completely to the supportive surface below you if there is lingering tension send warm loving thoughts and energy to this part of you in your mind's eye notice now the palms of your hands notice the energy here perhaps you feel this as warmth or tingling or a buzzing sensation notice how simply moving your awareness to this part of your body moves your energy to this point by simply paying attention you can move energy and move a positive sensation within you now begin to widen the experience of your sensations outward from your hands become aware of the sensations throughout your body feel the energy moving within you be in your body inhabit your body fully simply allow your focus to tune into the sensations of your body right here right now all you must do is think about relaxing and releasing the tension in your body and your body will respond because it listens to what your mind tells it and now as you ask for this release feel your entire body let go feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside let go and drift effortlessly into peace let go of any thoughts of worry any thoughts that might be holding you back from experiencing tranquility thoughts holding you back from sleep see these thoughts drift off in the wave of relaxation they will be there when you need them in the calm state of your mind let go of worries so you can sleep peacefully now let go of anything you may be holding on to from yesterday or earlier today let go of anything that may be taking up space in your mind give yourself permission to be right here right now doing just this sometimes it is helpful to invite the idea of offering yourself permission to let go of the past give yourself some space space for something new space to grow into like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow down in relationship to each breath as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts come back to noticing your breath when you find your mind wandering so that your mind can continue to clear the clutter of the overthinking tendency know that your subconscious mind will be aware of anything that is important to you you are in complete control but for now your mind and body no it is time to relax time to let go time to slow down right now any sounds around you are unimportant and they simply add to your relaxation all responsibilities and items on your to-do list are unimportant right now all you need to do is follow the soothing sound of my voice as a guide and allow your body to relax and your subconscious mind will do the job of clearing the clutter notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper allow yourself to drift into a deep state of relaxation letting yourself go letting your body mind and spirit become one and now that you are in a deep state of relaxation begin to use your imagination and take a moment to see yourself in front of a beautifully decorated glass elevator door this glass door is etched and frosted with the most amazing design

away from your body forever as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer allow the thoughts to pass by and return your attention to your breath and to the sound of my voice as your guide on this journey of relaxation and discovery now begin to deepen each breath in and out notice the stillness that comes between each inhale and exhale

1 hello and welcome to this powerful guided meditation my name is Jason Stephenson thank you for joining me this mindfulness meditation and visualization will lead you with compassion and curiosity deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation and then into the past before eventually carrying you into a deep and peaceful sleep I invite you to open your heart to this journey to whatever reveals itself knowing that you are unconditionally supported in each and every moment that passes allow the mind to rest aside as we move backwards through time there is nothing you will need to actively search for and nothing you'll need to find images and inner sensations may come for you but you will not need to control them manipulate them or force them in any way simply allow yourself to open up entirely to whatever moves through you as we take this journey allow this meditation in each moment to naturally reveal itself as you move deeper and deeper into the past so before we begin take a moment or two to come into a comfortable lying down position ensure that you feel safe and secure wherever you are ensure that your neck is aligned with the spine and your shoulders are relaxed [Music] take a moment to consciously release all muscles as you sink further into this supportive surface beneath you take a few deep breaths here grounding yourself in this present moment use your breath to guide you towards a place of complete stillness [Music] although we will be moving through the expansive field of time you can always ground yourself back into the present moment if you feel uncomfortable at any point you are in complete control of this journey so if any images or sensations arise that are too challenging for you to present Lee look at simply use your breath to anchor yourself back into the present moment you are always always in control of your journey with that said if any challenging images arise or if the experience becomes heavy you are also in an entirely safe domain to explore them images that arise in our consciousness can never hurt us they are solely tools or teachers that hold the potential to guide us forward in powerful and positive ways know that you are universally supported in each and every moment now take a moment to come back to your body notice your sense of touch through the way the surfaces around you make contact with your physical body feel into the textures that are present without moving noting how they feel as they rest against your skin [Music] consider the deeper levels of the physical body is it possible to become mindful of the cellular world [Music] notice your muscles and then invite them to relax encouraging them to sink further into the surface beneath you now consider the presence of air around your body and then gently follow it as it moves within filling your lungs fully as you take a breath in and returning to the world around you on your exhale allow the breath to become slow and steady just like the subtle lapping of waves against the shoreline take a few breaths on your own here following the innate rhythm of this life force that supports you [Music] [Music] allow yourself to come into a state of relaxation by drawing your breath to the heart space as you inhale allow your heart to expand filling itself to the outer edges with peace joy and clarity and as you exhale allow the walls of the heart to soften releasing any tension that may be stored there [Music] continue to breathe this way for a few more rounds effortlessly quietening the mind as you move closer and closer towards the true state of your heart [Music] begin to notice a growing sense of peace and tranquility as you become more attuned with the ever unfolding present moment in just a few moments we will begin our regression into the past allow your imagination to enrich your visions as you move further and further into the mystical landscape we are about to enter [Music] for just a few moments allow the space before your third eye to empty completely you may still see various colors and swirls of energy passing before you there's no need to change or attempt to control this instead see if you can simply observe whatever is present there just in front of your closed eyes [Music] you don't have to judge it or attempt to change it in any way simply notice the space that quietly and safely hold you in complete stillness [Music] in just a moment your sink as far into relaxation as is required for your personal present moment and needs simply follow my voice as I count down guiding you deeper and deeper into a state of all-encompassing peace and tranquility 10 you are feeling safe and secure embraced by this open space 9 all stress and tension is being released with every breath you take [Music] eight you were feeling heavy nourished by the energy around you [Music] seven you are releasing even further six every muscle is relaxed five you are completely comfortable to let go for sinking further and further three the mind is quiet and as you have come to relax completely to you breathe slowly deeply and effortlessly and one you have arrived completely at peace completely relaxed [Music] all is quiet all is at peace now something starts to appear before your eyes out of the vast empty space before you you notice a mist developing it is airy and enchanted somehow beckoning you closer you take a few steps towards this mist very slowly and mindfully and as you approach it begins to dissipate as it slowly clears you begin to see there is a bridge ahead of you covered in moss and vines you make your way towards it mindfully treading on the pressed earth beneath your feet and as you cross over everything you ever knew begins to disappear all thought all attachments all fears and all worries you are entering into a new world into a different time [Music] with every step you take you inch closer towards the space and time just on the other side of the bridge it is a place that feels familiar somehow but one that your conscious mind cannot put any memory to the mist continues to clear and you realize you are within a dense majestic forest you feel at home you feel at peace here [Music] he reached the other side of the bridge and with the mist having vanished completely now you take a closer look at the scenery around you notice the colors and textures of this vibrant forest consider the way the earth feels beneath your feet [Music] you heighten your awareness of the aroma that awakens as you inhale deeply [Music] allow this place to nurture the deep sense of peace that is within you he walk forward ever so slightly as you noticed something peeking through from within the trees and as you approach you realize there is a cabin hidden within these woods and somehow you sense that it is or was your own you instantly remember it perhaps becoming flooded with visions of what it was once like in your own time you reach the front door and enter [Music] take a few moments to witness the visuals that are arising [Music] what does the cabin look like what happened here once upon a time [Music] who is with you imagery may come slowly and subtly simply allow them to arise in their own time allow your imagination and intuition to expand quite effortlessly mindfully consider what was once here that no longer remains [Music] remain open to whatever arises there is no need to fear the past it no longer has any control over you simply allow yourself to become the outside observer of whatever you feel has happened here watch this film play out as if you are a viewer rather than the character at center stage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] continue to breathe deeply as you simply observe whatever is present without judgment or condemnation [Music] [Music] as we move through this time we shed old ways of being in order to make room for more expansive ones mindfully begin to consider what messages or lessons are being shared through these images that are arising what is there to be learned what is there to shed allow the mind to remain quiet as your intuition arises tune in with your heart opening yourself to the possibility of transformation [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] return to your breath and to the aroma of the woods take a few more moments to witness whatever once happened at this beautiful cabin in the forest [Music] and slowly in your own time returned to the bridge slowly crossing back over as you return to the present physical reality you passed through the mist once more making your way to the other side 10 you are breathing deeply 9 you feel inspired and uplifted by what you have learned 8 you are calm and relaxed seven your breath flows as steady as gentle waves caressing the shore [Music] six the past fading now five you feel deeply connected to the physical world for you exhale deeply letting everything melt away three you feel gratitude for the present reality you are in two you know that you are whole and complete in this very moment one you have arrived you are home once again you are at peace [Music] with the past now behind you you feel deeply settled within this present moment you know that the past cannot be changed but that it provides opportunity for growth and expansion everything you witnessed now dissipates just as the mist did as you crossed over and into the past you are still and silent and for the moment nothing remains to be seen you continue to allow positive and empowering lessons to reach you as you transition into a sleeping state but you are not in search of anything you are ready to rest easy for the entire night ahead dozing off swiftly and soundly take a few more breaths mindfully inhaling peace contentment and freedom [Music] and exhaling everything whatever once was [Music] [Music] [Music] the only place that truly exists is this very moment everything that once was can be used as a tool for self-realization at some future moment but for now allow your breath to gently rock you to sleep allow yourself to be nourished throughout the night ahead repeat the following words to yourself in silence as you gently fall into a deep slumber I am at home I am supported I am at peace I am home I am supported I am at peace I am home I am supported I am NOT peace [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will help you to effortlessly wind down and to fall asleep quickly by consciously inviting relaxation into your body and mind and by using the power of visualization you will soon enter a deeply relaxed state that is conducive of a solid night's slumber my name is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to follow me on this journey as you slowly surrender to sleep I invite you now to begin drawing your attention to your physical body and making any adjustments necessary to facilitate relaxation use any cushions or blankets you need for warmth or support and also ensure that any distracting lights are turned off and that your blinds are drawn [Music] see if you can comfortably form one straight line from tailbone to neck and then let your limbs relax wherever they are comfortable close your eyes if you've not done so and take a few slow and steady breaths to settle in [Music] as we move through this meditation know that there is nothing you need to achieve or accomplish simply let these words flow effortlessly through you use them to ground your attention if the mind wanders away into less than settling thoughts now let us begin by practicing some deep belly breathing to help us shift further into the body's rest and digest state of being so begin by drawing your attention to the stomach perhaps placing a hand there if you like and after your next full exhalation take a deep breath in letting the belly expand as the air enters into you hold the breath at the top for just a second and then slowly let the air back out through the pursed lips just watching the belly fall when you reach the bottom hold the air out for just a second or two and then take another full deep breath in so continue to breathe in this way for just a few moments on your own letting each inhalation and each exhalation belong letting the belly rise and fall with each cycle and also allowing for a second pause at the end of each in-breath and each out breath [Music] continue breathing this way for a short while longer letting your attention ground in the sensation of breathing [Music] and after your next exhalation allow your breath to resume its natural depth pace and rhythm [Music] note what it feels like to be in your body now observing any shifts that you may have already experienced remember that during meditation when you are invited to note your experience there is nothing expected of you just simply allow your experience to be what it is in this moment trusting that everything is moving you towards a greater state of harmony [Music] and take a moment now to draw your attention to the physical body noting any areas of unconscious contraction it is not uncommon to hold tension in the brow in the shoulders in the belly or in your hips and so as you observe the fullness of your body in this moment see where you might be able to soften to surrender more completely to the earth beneath you [Music] if there is tension or discomfort that cannot be consciously relaxed I invite you to instead send that area a few loving words of support you might even silently ask what part of me is calling for attention here bless whatever aspect of mind or body comes to your awareness by sending it your kindness and care [Music] now in just a moment we'll begin a soothing visualization that will help you to wind down even further but before we do just take a moment to notice the surface that hold you notice the stillness of your body and the support of the physical world just open yourself up to the beauty of this simple quiet moment before we transition in the realm of inspired imagination [Music] now I invite you to begin visualizing that you are standing in a wide-open enchanted corridor with windows lining the wall to your right [Music] the high ceiling above you boasts a floral mural peach violet and gold flowers intertwined with vines decorate the space overhead the hallway feels majestic as if you are in an old palace that time has forgotten old pieces of artwork lined the walls and yet you know the space is well-kept as there are no signs of dust or debris it is well kept in your mind at the very least [Music] and off to your right through the expansive windows that line the corridor you peer out over crystal waters a sea extends as far as the eye can see the skies clear birds frolic in the sky and the waves are caressing the shore the Sun is slowly setting upon this peaceful land casting a dark pink light across the horizon yearning to smell the sea breeze you crack open a window and take a full deep nourishing breath in and you let it back out [Music] another deep salty breath in through the nostrils and then slowly release once again [Music] each breath of this fresh air cleanses you purifying body mind and soul [Music] you step away from the window now curious as to where this corridor might lead you the world outside is beautiful and inspiring you long for a deep and nourishing rest and so you decide to head out in search of a place to lay your head you turn away from the window now and slowly make your way down the corridor your feet tread lightly you are completely aware of each moment you make [Music] you carry on down the hallway pausing as you reach a closed door at the end above the doorway there is a sign that reads to the cave of peace something settles within you simply upon reading this sign and so you slowly reach out your hand to pull open the door just on the other side an enchanted spiral staircase presents itself undoubtedly leading you down towards the cave of peace below the number 10 is etched in gold on the stone wall of the staircase suggesting you are ten flights up from the earth below you take a moment to prepare for the descent admiring the smooth stone walls the marble staircase and the gold-plated hand railing that spirals effortlessly downwards you take a deep breath in and out and then you begin taking the twisting steps towards the ninth floor as you reach the landing of the ninth floor you feel a weight fall from your shoulders all the worries of the day have been released and you feel yourself breathing deeper easier than you did before you arrived here as your shoulders drop away from your ears your heart space opens you feel light and free after a full mindful breath you carry on towards the eighth floor gliding graciously down the marble steps [Music] when you arrive on this next landing you feel your jaw drop and your brow relaxed your head space begins to feel lighter as you open more fully to this journey of deep release taking a full deep breath in and out and then you carry on slowly down the staircase taking your time to reach the seventh floor landing [Music] when you arrive there you feel a wave of gratitude wash over you you feel grateful for the air that nourishes you for the space that holds you and for the beauty that lives within you silently thank the universe for all that you were blessed with after another mindful breath you carry on down the staircase pausing when you reach the sixth floor [Music] here on the sixth floor you take a moment to tune into your heart and are flooded with the sense of embodied self-love self-care and self compassion something within you awakens to your own divinity and in response you feel a deep sense of appreciation for who you are exactly as you are you take another moment to revel in this sense of self appreciation before continuing on down the marble staircase [Music] as you come to reach the fifth floor something within you whispers for you to let go perhaps it is a belief you've been holding on to that no longer serves you or a worry you've been carrying too heavily [Music] whatever within you might be ready to depart breathe it out with a deep exhalation before continuing down towards the fourth floor [Music] you'll and gracefully on the fourth floor landing and as you do you are overcome with a sense of deep trust in the universe you realize that every single step you've taken in this life has brought you to where you are now and where you are now here in this enchanted staircase is serving you in countless ways you trust that this is exactly where you were meant to be and after taking a mindful breath here you continue your descent [Music] soon you reach the third floor where something within you whispers this moment is enough this moment is enough [Music] you pause here grounding your two feet into the solid floor beneath you you peer out through a window that overlooks the sea just beyond these walls and your heart opens even wider to embrace the peace and simplicity of this moment yes you think to yourself this moment is enough continuing the descent you move your feet again allowing them to carry you gracefully to the landing below as you arrive on the second floor you pause yet again full presence comes to you now there is nothing you seek nothing you are grasping at and while yes some part of you longs to rest completely by dozing off into slumber there is no anxiety in you about it you know that you will arrive there very soon and that it will be this peaceful present energy that assists you in getting to that state with ears two more flights to go and so you continue your journey towards the first floor landing as you arrive on the main floor you feel completely and deeply grounded fully aware of your connection to the earth beneath and around you you know that you are well rooted in this life and in this moment you feel centered stable and supported a sign by the top step of the next set of stairs reads to the cave of peace and so you take a full deep breath once again then you make your way step by step to that final floor just beneath the earth and as you step off that final stair you find yourself in a wide-open room that is indeed cave-like and lit with candles it is the most elegant cave you have ever seen majestic in its outfit a splendid rug the color of mole breeze and the Tuscan Sun covers much of the floor off to the side a four-poster bed sits elegantly it is adorned with plush cushions and blankets that cause you towards it and yet before you go you take a moment to admire the quietude of this space the simplicity the elegance and the comfort the candle light soothes your soul as it flickers against the walls of the cave [Music] and now ready to rest your head you take a moment to gently blow out all of the candles in the room leaving the one next to your bed for last [Music] you make your final preparations for sleep and then you crawl into the cozy bed before you when you are settled you blow out the last remaining candle and sink into the darkness of this room your body rejoices at the comfort of this place you have found yourself in it feels well supported and fully nourished in this abode the space is quiet cozy and peaceful and so you prepare to let your entire body ease into a deep slumber there's settle more completely you come back to your breath held safely in this night you allow your belly to soften and the breath to flow as deep as it is comfortable to with each breath ian you feel a sense of universal love and support entering you and with each breath out you free yourself of any tension that no longer serves you [Music] your breath resumes its natural pace now as you draw your attention to the top of your head as you hold this space in your awareness you send it your love and invite it to relax as you exhale gently your attention shifts towards the space between your eyebrows and in the same way you witness love and ease this part of you through your presence and through your breath [Music] you continue in the same way nourishing your cheeks and your jaw your tongue and your mouth softening relaxing [Music] and your throat and shoulders dropping letting go [Music] [Music] next you trace the length of your left arm all the way to your fingertips inviting it to soften into the surface beneath you [Music] repeating the same on the opposite side you allow your right arm to be seen and to relax completely you trace it from the right shoulder all the way to your fingertips draw your attention now back to the heart space holding this loving center of your being in full awareness as you breathe into the heart watch it expand and as you exhale from the heart allowed to soften your attention slowly shifts down your spine relaxing each vertebrae and the surrounding muscles as you gently make your way towards your stomach and as you hold your belly in your awareness you offer it your love and invite it to rest for the night you hold your pelvis and your hips and your loving awareness next breathing into it and out of this space completely and then slowly you draw this loving awareness down the left-leg inviting it to relax in its entirety all the way down to your toes [Music] you then come back up to the right hip and slowly repeat this process of softening as you scan the length of your right leg all the way down to your toes [Music] now hold your entire body in your awareness letting each inhalation move all the way into the farthest reaches of your being and each exhalation to soften the entire body [Music] [Music] the body is relaxed the mind is relaxed and now nothing stands between you and a deep peaceful sleep [Music] the envisioned room in your mind's eye dissolves as you realize you are once again in the room that holds you physically and though you are no longer in the cave of peace that once held you it has bestowed its energy upon each one of yourselves it's peaceful presence remains with you [Music] continue to mind your breath gently now as you slowly allow yourself to sink into a deep and peaceful night's sleep rest well my friend rest well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 hello and welcome to this guided meditation and visualization that will help you to cleanse negative energy from both mind and body before leading you into a restorative night's sleep my name is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to set the world you know aside as you open your heart and mind to the possibility of awakening new inspired energy to begin take a moment to find a comfortable lying down position and using whatever blankets and pillows you need for support and then closing your eyes when you're ready soften your brow [Music] your jaw and your limbs just allowing your entire body to soften into the surface beneath you before we dive deeper into this visualization let's take a moment to mindfully tune into the present moment beginning with the breath noticing the path that your breath takes as it moves through you beginning as it enters your nostrils moves through your windpipe and fills your lungs and then notice the same path but in Reverse watching how the chest and belly soften as you exhale [Music] observe that gentle subtle movement of the body as you breathe becoming more aware of the aliveness of your being and now as the breath enters I invite you to draw your attention towards the stomach welcoming the breath to flow all the way into it and as you exhale let the belly soften completely just take a few more deep belly breaths on your own now perhaps releasing a softer sigh with your next view exhalations and now I invite you to let the breath expand even further by imagining each inhalation reaching into the furthest corners of your body into your toes your fingertips and your crown and when you come to exhale imagine the breath taking with it any and all tension lingering anywhere within the body you breathe into the fullness of your being and then invite your entire body to release as you exhale take just a few more full-body breaths on your own when you were ready to let go of even this breathing technique let your breath resume its natural pace depth and rhythm in a few moments we will begin a visualization that will help you to cleanse any negative energy you may be holding and as we move through this practice I invite you to remain compassionate and patient towards yourself softening any judgement if it arises I encourage this because it is not uncommon that we feel shame guilt or judgment when we consider that we have been harnessing negative thoughts feelings or other energies and yet all of these things are a part of the human experience they offer us opportunities to learn evolve and awaken regardless of where this negative energy may have come from I invite you to release any stories you might hold about wrongdoing and by softening shame and guilt and through opening up to ourselves with compassion and patience we lovingly create space to release what no longer serves us and to invite in the energy that will so take a moment now to draw your attention to the crown of your head gently softening any tension you might observe here or in the space of the third eye relax your shoulders your arms release your belly and any other unnecessary tension and then come back to your breath as we prepare to cleanse our energy field through the power of this visualization calling upon your innate capacity for imagination now I invite you to envision that you are on a small chartered boat sailing calmly and gently towards the shore of a pristine tropical island you sit or stand at the prow breathing in the fresh salty breeze of the open sea around you you have charted this small boat for an island getaway for a chance to rest reset and cleanse yourself of any negative energy you've been exposed to or have been holding on to and as the boat nears the dock at the shore you feel your shoulders releasing some of the unnecessary weight they've been carrying no breathing deepens and finally the boat pulls up against the dock overhanging the turquoise waters you carefully step on to the steady dock turning to thank the captain and to let him know that you will be back later in the day then you head on your way your backpack is full of all you need for the day and so pulling the straps tight now you begin your journey through the pathway that leads through the tropical jungle oasis palm trees and other lush greenery line the narrow trail you find yourself on birds ring out in the trees overhead as do chirping insects and croaking amphibians the air is completely free of any man-made sounds you relish in this in the purity of the symphony that fills your ears already you can feel your lungs being cleansed your breath moving deeper and your body being filled with pristine air full of vitality you continued on a little while longer weaving through the jungle of this private island [Music] eventually you come across a shimmering Azure Blue Lagoon just off to your right you take a moment's pause here kneeling down by the water's edge something about this Lagoon feels enchanted something tells you that the water is listening that it is aware of your presence so you take this as an invitation to consciously set the intention to release any negative energy that has been harbored within you take a moment to formulate this intention in your own words and when you were ready you whisper this intention to the pristine mystic waters before you you sense that simply through having set this intention something has been released and that the process of deep cleansing and rejuvenation has been upgraded so you take a few final moments to absorb the beauty of this Lagoon and then you continue along the path that has gotten ooh this far continuing to make your way through the lush environment you've retreated to you feel a deep sense of gratitude for this opportunity to clear your energy field [Music] not only do you thank the environment that is supporting you now but you also feel a sense of appreciation for the part of you that made this retreat a priority you thank yourself for this act of self-care you carry on until soon the path widens slowly transitioning from soil to sand and as you make your way through the last layers of trees on this opposite side of the island your jaw drops at the purity of the white sand beach before you and at the calm turquoise waters that ripple out from the island you've arrived at a place where you can allow all remaining negativity to be cleared from your being you are certain that this is the place for it and so you take off your shoes carrying them in one hand as you walk closer towards the water you walk slowly allowing your feet to sink into the warm sand with each step a few meters from where the soft wave slap against the shore you drop your bag and your shoes letting your feet ground into the sand rooting yourself through your feet you then stretch your arms up towards the sky your heart opens as your chest pushes forward welcoming the radiance of the Sun the sky and sea you let your arms come to rest by your sides now as you gaze out over the open waters with not a single other landmass inside you feel as if you're a world away from the everyday you take a deep breath in and letting it go with a sigh and then you lay out your towel and prepare to head into the calm and cleansing waters you remember the intention you had said to cleanse yourself of any negative energies perhaps negative thoughts feelings habits or more subtle energies that no longer serve you and as you begin walking towards the water you invite these negative energies to come to the forefront of your mind and you hold them here not to judge criticize or condemn them but to silently let them know that you can see them and to let them know that it is time for them to be let go [Music] slowly wading into the water you let the cool sea brush against your skin beginning to cleanse you from the outside continuing on until you are waist-deep you pause and then you bring your palms together in front of your body inviting all negative energies to be held between them raising your arms up and overhead you let these negative energies begin moving away from your body and you throw them forward sending them off into the sea as your hands dip underwater all the negative energies you once held begin to dissolve in the salty water that surrounds you you let the water to continue to cleanse you of all negative energies that you do not wish to hold on to you can even watch all the negative attachments float away from you [Music] all negative beliefs and stories all self-limiting beliefs and any of the negative energies you've picked up from the world around you all of it is now dissolving in the ocean feel free to roll on your back floating here safely for some time as the sunshine beams down on you [Music] slowly the subtle waves carry you back towards the shoreline and as you get closer you rise to your feet and slowly make your way back onto the beach resting your back on your towel you lie down here and let the Sun and the Seabreeze continue to cleanse you you notice there is far more room to breathe now to breathe in light love and positivity the negative energies you once held now feel so distant and all you are left with is room to grow new ideas new beliefs and new dreams and to conjure up new energies you feel immensely blessed for this transformation and as the Sun beams down on you you sense it awakening each and every cell in your body it awakens the cells in your toes your feet your lower legs your knees and your thighs it reinvigorates the cells in your hips your pelvis and your root chakra [Music] it brings new life to your belly your lower back your chest and your heart and your upper back and in the same way it awakens all the cells in your arms from your fingertips right up to your shoulders the cells and energy center in your throat awakens to as do all the cells in your face finally the top of your head the crown area opens up to the sunlight completely becoming a portal for positive energy to flow through your entire body you are fully alive here fully awake and positively inspired you come back to your breath letting each inhalation spread throughout your entire body and each exhalation to soften you you melt into the sand a little bit further with each breath knowing there is nothing you need to hold on to here a great wave of compassion washes through you as you bless yourself but the places you've been and the courage of harnessed to arrive here letting go and allowing for cleansing to happen is not always easy and so you feel immense appreciation to yourself for opening up in this way [Music] you also feel a growing compassion for all those who've crossed your path for those who have been weighed down by their own negative energy - you see the goodness and light at the core of everything you spend just a few more moments here on the sand beneath the Sun and then you slowly rise to your feet and prepare to head back to the boat that awaits you you take one last look at the beach and see that so graciously held you offering them your thanks and you turn towards the path that brought you here slowly venturing back into the tropical abyss as you walk you feel a lightness in your steps and in your entire body you move with ease and grace all parts of you are now deeply cleansed soon you make your way back to the lagoon where you had powerfully set your intention you pause at its edge letting an inner smile spread through you all of a sudden the tropical Symphony begins to grow louder the birds chirp with glee from their perches the frogs croak with contentment and the insects sing in their own way it sounds to you as though the jungle is applauding rejoicing in this return to your natural state of being you continue on your way leaving the lagoon behind positive energy continues to spread through you eventually you arrive back at the outer limits of the jungle noting the dock and the boat that awaits you slowly you make your way over towards it thanking the captain for his time you climb back in taking a comfortable seat on the boat and as it slowly pulls away from the dock and the island you look back in love and admiration of your experience here you consider how unconditionally you were held by the sand and by the sea feeling in complete alignment with the world you thank the sea for cleansing you of the energies you no longer needed and you imagine these energies slowly sinking to the ocean floor where they will be transformed into their raw pure elements [Music] as the boat continues towards the nearest mainland you let your back come to rest on its surface it's smooth and steady journey across the water lulls you towards slumber a state that will continue to process all of the transformation you experienced here you take one more deep breath in of the sea breeze and as you exhale you gently release the imagery of this beautiful cleansing landscape grounding yourself back into the surface that supports you in this reality carrying the experience of being cleansed into the awakened life notice the natural ebb and flow of your breathing using it to anchor you anytime the mind wanders in these next few moments before sleep and as you slowly drift off let the following affirmations flow through you to reaffirm the cleansing that has taken place as these words float through your subconscious mind they will help to embed this new reality into your daily life I let go of what no longer serves me I am an embodiment of love and truth

can be turned off just take care of these small matters before settling into a comfortable lying down position [Music] wherever you are and sure that the spine and neck are straight but relaxed and that you are supported in any way that you need take your time to adjust any cushions or blankets so the gyrus comfortable as possible in this very moment [Music] set an intention now to fully let go through both body and mind as we enter a process of complete release now let's begin by becoming more mindful of this exact moment in time and space begin by drawing your awareness to your ears and to all the sounds that you may currently be infiltrating through them you open your hearing simply observe all the sounds that come from subtle hums to more prominent noises outside you without judging or labeling these sounds practice remaining in a state of deep awareness as vibrations filter into your eardrums and as they disappear allow the Mayans tendencies to categorize to label and the judge to step aside as you simply witness these noises as dynamic expressions of life as simple and subtle vibrations of energy now expand your awareness of this present moment by beginning to observe the physical space you rest in notice the air that touches your skin and the material world that supports and surrounds you [Music] take a few moments to observe each inch of your body that is in contact with the physical world [Music] you might come to notice the temperature of your body and surfaces around you you might observe the textures of blankets and pillows that brush against your skin [Music] and you might even observe a barely describable feeling of support of safety or of heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you [Music] [Music] notice if the body's formation or sensory experience changes in any way as you become more mindful of this physical space you are in [Music] become more mindful now of your breath quietly observing the rhythm and depth of its present form [Music] [Music] to be mindful does not mean to change or to manipulate the present moment in any way that the mind deemed to make better or worthy to the contrary mindful awareness asks us to open to and to accept this moment exactly as it is so with this in mind see if you can open to your breath exactly as it is right now releasing any judgment or expectation for it to feel any differently than it presently does [Music] if a natural deepening occurs allow this simply noticing it as a natural movement of energy further into your being [Music] continue to observe the breath for a few more moments feeling into the expression of each inhalation and each exhalation notice the feeling of air entering through your nasal cavity filling your lungs and pressing upward against your belly [Music] and then notice the same dynamic movement in Reverse observing any sensations connected to your fall exhalation [Music] just breathe here in mindful awareness for a few more silent moments [Music] if the mind wanders at any point during this meditation see if you can refrain from judgment as you compassionately call your attention back to the present moment it is in the minds nature to wander but with that said we can use the power of our intention to refocus our attention back on this present moment this refocusing is what helps us to enter an expanding state of complete of relaxation in just a few moments we will enter into a full-body scan through which you will become deeply aware of the presence of tightness in the body and then of the feeling of complete relaxation you will be guided to witness tighten and release each area that we pass allowing each part of the body to come to deep rest and complete ease in preparation for a peaceful night's sleep [Music] as much as possible see if you can align tightening movements with your inhalations and all movements towards release with your exhalations just breathe naturally in between each muscle group that we work on [Music] so before we begin into this body scan I invite you to make any adjustments now that will help you to feel into the entirety of your body you might find that it is easiest to access each muscle when in a straight line down position on your back however if this is not comfortable for you come into a position that is as neutral as possible while remaining comfortable ensure that the chest is open with shoulders drawing away from the ears allow your breath to continue to be in the background of your awareness secondary only to your gently shifting awareness of the physical body so begin by noticing your toes feeling into them exactly as they are in this moment notice if there are any sensations present any tiredness or softness [Music] and now consciously tighten just your toes on your next inhalation observing what it feels like for them to be pulled inwards completely and then exhale letting them go and allowing all tension melting away with ease [Music] now bring your awareness towards both feet toes and ankles included observing them exactly as they are in this moment on the next breath in tensor muscles in the feet area holding tightly for just a brief moment and then release all of the tension on your exhalation allowing your feet toes and ankles to rest back down completely and breathing normally for a few moments [Music] observe now the presence of both of your lakes drawing your awareness all the way from your heels up to your hips noting any sensations you pass along the way hold the entirety of both legs in your awareness and then inhale as you tighten these muscles squeezing them in towards your midline hold there for a moment and then exhale releasing them completely into the surface beneath you [Music] moving to the area between the hips draw your awareness to your pelvis on your next breath in tighten all of these muscles holding them for just a brief moment and then release them completely on your next breath out just feel into this complete release from your pelvis downward letting each of these areas sink further into the support of the physical world [Music] observe the stomach region now becoming aware of its present state and then as you inhale tighten all of these core muscles holding them in tightly for just a moment as you hold the breath in and then release entirely as you exhale softening all muscles around the belly return to your natural breathing rhythm as you relax the stomach completely [Music] now expand your awareness of the stomach to encompass the entire tosser from lower back to upper and from belly up to the shoulders take a moment now to observe each muscle group in the core of your body [Music] now on your next inhalation tighten them or towards the midline of your body feeling them in a contracted state and then release heavily with a sigh allowing your entire torso to relax completely [Music] take a moment here to reconnect with your breath mindfully observing its present form [Music] bring your awareness now to your hands fingers included observe the way they are resting in this moment noticing if they are relaxed or tense or somewhere in between [Music] as you inhale allow all of these muscles in the hands and fingers to tighten coming into a compressed fist hold for a brief second or two and then exhale as you release allowing both hands to rest completely relaxed [Music] draw your awareness now from your wrists all the way up to your shoulders and compasses all the muscles and areas in between so inhale as you contract all of these muscles perhaps pulling them up towards your ears and then soften releasing all of these muscles in the limbs back down shoulders falling back down gently as well notice how different it feels in both body and mind between your contracted States and your softened ones now begin to observe all of the intricate muscles in your face noticing if there are any sensations present here consider the muscles in your jaw your cheeks your eyebrows and your forward [Music] now inhale as you contract all of these muscles squeezing your entire face together hold for just a moment observing the sensation and then exhale as you release all of these muscles completely let go of each muscle allowing all tension to drain away [Music] take a moment to come back to your breath for just a moment observing the entire body right where it is and right as it is [Music] observe this neutral state just for a moment and then on your next inhalation contract every muscle group accessible to your awareness squeezing the entirety of your body towards your midline hold everything together with the breath held in and then release completely letting a deep sigh escape from your lungs as all remaining tension and stress falls away allow each muscle to melt into the surface beneath you allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm as you sing further and further into the experience of this complete relaxation [Music] continue to breathe naturally mindfully observing the flow of air into and out of your being [Music] in this state of deep relaxation and release there is absolutely nothing to do but be entirely present with every muscle group relaxed completely you are moments away from drifting into a peaceful sleep that is in alignment with your present state of tranquillity allow your breath to become like waves your body is soft and gentle as the water beneath the service as you breathe notice yourself being rocked gently into an even deeper state of tranquillity the mind follows the body's lead quietening softening as you come into harmony with everything within and around you with every inch of your being having been consciously relaxed allow yourself to float effortlessly into a deep slumber allow your breath and the sounds to soothe your entire being as you slowly but surely descend completely into restorative and peaceful night's sleep and allow these affirmations to sink into your subconscious mind even if you do fall asleep trust that these affirmations will assist you as you drift deeper deeper into sleep I am relaxing deeper and deeper my mind is slowing down all

environment for sleep to easily come to you when you are ready i invite you to make yourself comfortable for the start of this practice lie down on your back if you are able feel free to place a pillow under your knees to keep your back comfortable [Music] very gently tilt your chin downward and as you do this sense the back of your neck subtly lengthening allow yourself to begin to relax now with your eyes open keep your head still and move your eyes only as far as you can to your right [Music] although it may be dark continue to keep your eyes to your right as you breathe in and out deeply it may feel right to allow a sigh exhale [Music] take two more breaths allowing yourself to let go into relaxation after taking three breaths bring your eyes back to center and blink a few times and now still with your eyes open keep your head still and move your eyes only as far to your left as you can just like you did on the other side continue to keep your eyes to your left as you breathe in and out deeply again sigh it out if you like [Music] take a total of three breaths here [Music] allowing yourself to think deeper and deeper into a relaxed awareness of yourself bring your eyes back to center and again blink a few times [Music] one more position now with your eyes open roll your eyes up as if you were trying to look into your own eyebrows continue to look up as you take a deep breath in and out again breathe in [Music] and out letting go letting go letting go on your next breath out this time give in to the heaviness of your eyelids and allow your eyes to gently close down as your eyelids close you may sense the muscles in and around your eyes become heavy and relaxed this is a sign to the rest of your body to let go of tension and to move towards sleep now just forget all about your eyes [Music] and bring your awareness to your hands notice the energy and any sensations here with your next inhale make fists clench your hands strongly then as you exhale release your grip in your hands and throughout your entire body do this one more time clench your fists tightly as you breathe in and let go completely as you breathe out allow yourself to release the gripping not only in your hands but also throughout your whole being continue to make yourself comfortable adjust your posture for maximum comfort if needed knowing you are safe and fully supported as you continue to allow a relaxed state to wash over your entire body become aware of your natural breath notice the aspect of your breath that draws your attention first as you become aware here count your breath in without making any changes simply allow it to be what it is notice the count of your breath out just as it is [Music] accept your natural breath count and support it with your awareness anytime your mind wanders throughout this practice come back to your breath to refocus if the count changes allow this accept this invite ease into your breath your body and your mind like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow with every breath allow yourself the opportunity to relax into stillness at your own pace there is no rush as you begin to make space for your practice there is no right or wrong as you allow yourself time to settle your body into stillness know you are in the right place invite sleep to easily come to you let go of any resistance or worry to experience deep blissfully tranquil sleep as you allow the counting of your breath to drift away move your awareness to the sensations on the surface layer of your body [Music] perhaps notice where fabric touches your skin or the air brushes against you [Music] maybe you notice where one part of your body rests against another what are the sensations do you sense a specific temperature it is not about what you find when you look the benefits of this practice of awareness are offered because you are pausing and looking within fully experience these sensations even if you are only noticing one small space as you continue to notice the surface feelings encourage a sense of softening or ease to spread through your body [Music] begin to notice the sensations inside your body now as you quiet your thoughts you begin to hear the sensations when you slow down and stay with the sensations you notice more [Music] you may even learn something new about yourself [Music] take interest in yourself as you are with curiosity if you are able to allow life just as it is it can lessen suffering as you notice the sensations inside your body do you feel a buzzing or tingling energy do you sense the heaviness of your bones sinking into the surface supporting you once you are aware of your reality you may ask yourself what would it feel like for you to invite ease to move from the surface of your body to deep within [Music] listen with intrigue whatever arises during meditation is your teacher it is your reminder to be present and practice acceptance you can either encounter resistance or experience bliss by letting go and accepting your present state you are moving towards bliss look for what wants to be seen [Music] listen to what wants to be heard open to your experience of life with acceptance you may ask yourself what must i accept or release resistance to in order to experience a calm mind allow the answer to come without forcing it let the resistance dissolve away through acceptance scan through the sensations of your body with a relaxed awareness free of judgment surrender any tension you may notice soften any area you may experience gripping allow this surrender to happen naturally throughout your body by simply offering your awareness soften from the surface all the way to deep within you release any guarding you may be holding on to surrender to anything you are holding on to for fear of losing let go of what could have been let go of any worry let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders let any tension dissolve from your muscles every day we get a new chance to be in this moment surrender to the ability of your body to heal all emotional healing starts with self-love and forgiveness and emotional healing gives way to physical healing what else can you release or let go of to invite the healing process is it resentment shame or blame is it guilt or disappointment towards yourself whatever you are holding on to let it go love your body love your emotions love your thoughts love yourself express compassion and healing towards yourself can you find any areas where you are holding on and then let go perhaps you may be holding at the area of your stomach can you let go here continue to connect with relaxation as deeply as you can practice surrender practice letting go open to the healing energy within [Music] are you able to relax even more connect even deeper to yourself listen to your heart surrender to your inner wisdom your healing intuition [Music] let go of your body further and further into relaxation now as you continue to relax and allow a deep healing sleep to come to you whenever you are ready [Music] let your imagination conjure your personal healing place this is a sanctuary in your mind where you can safely experience profound

need healing being here in your healing place is an opportunity for you to connect with the deepest part of you where the wisdom of your body knows exactly what you need to heal yourself perhaps if it feels right you may also imagine there is a healing being here in your sanctuary with you someone who loves you and would help you heal or a professional healer or even a healing energy that would help and support you whatever healer comes to mind is just right for you as your mind knows exactly what you need to heal [Music] allow this healing support to move into your body mind and heart to

1 ease into deep sleep quickly with the soothing guided meditation unwind after a long busy day disconnect from worry and let your mental activity naturally begin to slow and practice acceptance to let go of resistance while you sleep when you expect your reality to be something other than what it actually is you add unnecessary suffering to your experience when you can release your resistance and accept what is you can experience peace what you're thinking about right before you fall asleep will set the tone for not only the quality of your sleep but also your mindset for the next day you have the choice to change the way you look at things hello and welcome I'm massara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self-healing let's settle in for this evening meditation and relaxation practice I invite you to make yourself comfortable create a safe and tranquil environment for yourself making sure you are all set to drift off into sleep if you wish it is important for you to have the sense of safety so you can fully relax make sure your room is dark and if possible turn off all screens and electronics if you are listening to this on an electronic device perhaps turn the screens light away from you create the most comfortable environment that you can feel free to pause this recording as you get yourself set up if you need [Music] as you are settling in lie down under your covers stretch your legs and take three deep breaths [Music] if your mind is wandering it's no big deal that is typical as the momentum of the day gradually slows simply become aware of your thoughts just as they are with acceptance notice these thoughts arising and passing by notice with curiosity and permission rather than the need for change the mind will not stop thinking completely so you can choose to notice accept and allow these thoughts to pass by [Music] as you acknowledge and allow your thoughts to pass you can begin to slip deeply into relaxation [Music] become aware of your breath just as it is notice with curiosity all there is to notice about your natural graph without the need to have it be something that it is not already [Music] since your breath without the need to change it in any way [Music] our breath is always there for us in the background an automatic action let the inhale and exhale guide you into a calm deeply relaxed State become aware of your inner physical experience just as it is notice how you are showing up to this practice not needing to be something else [Music] not needing to be somewhere different than exactly where you are take note of exactly where you are on your journey with acceptance [Music] you can give yourself permission to simply be peace is available when we stop resisting any given moment notice your body sensations just as they are notice any body pain with acceptance notice anybody pleasure with acceptance notice any neutral areas with acceptance settle into your body except being in your body right now just as you are take this time to be with yourself move closer to yourself accepting all that you are there is no need to make a change during meditation be just as you are accepting allows us to fully experience what is happening in the present moment to fully engage in life [Music] know that without suffering we cannot know joy without darkness we cannot know light allowing life as it is can lessen any struggle and perhaps additional unnecessary suffering when you feel life brings you challenges you can't accept you have the opportunity to be transformed by acceptance you may add suffering when you resist the way things are because they aren't the way you expect or want them to be you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the way things are naturally there is a possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true [Music] peace is available when you stop resisting any given moment become aware of your whole body in your environment [Music] notice where your body makes contact with the surface beneath you and feel yourself being grounded since the weight of your body making a strong anchoring connection [Music] let go into gravity to feel heavy into your support notice the fabric of your clothes on your skin or the areas of exposed skin feeling the touch of the air simply be aware of your experience in this moment [Music] scan your body for any areas of tension except your experience as it is and then use your attention to welcome a softening a sense of ease to move throughout your body [Music] as you observe your body soften and release any areas you are able invite in the feeling of peace as you begin to tune out the whole world around you and go within with my voice as a soothing guide to help you sleep in a moment I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the top of your head going all the way through your body down to your feet as I say each part of your body you can see that part in your mind's eye notice what is true with acceptance so that you can invite relaxation to that body part welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind encourage the weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface below you so that there is no need to hold on you can simply let go into sleep now as you begin to scan your body bring your attention to the top of your head begin to notice the sensations here [Music] and then relax the top of your head and your scalp [Music] welcome this ease into your forehead and eyes relax any facial expression release the tiny muscles around your eyes and feel your eyelids becoming heavy allow your cheeks to soften unclench your jaw and allow your teeth to part become aware of the area of your neck and throat and with acceptance of your present moment experience completely relaxed as you accept yourself just as you are you allow each muscle to relax in progression and this invites a deeper sense of relaxation to the parts of your body that came before it in your body scan continue to notice except and relax as you invite a sense of peace and stillness to your shoulders chest and arms perhaps feeling a comfortable heaviness move into your ribs abdomen and back [Music] let go of any gripping in your hips and allow your thighs to rest heavy on the surface below you as if there is no difference between where you end and where the surface begins you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part allows it to relax and let go since now your ankles and feet releasing and relaxing completely take another moment to slowly scan your body once more [Music] this time notice any areas that may still be holding on to any lingering tension and after acknowledging and accepting your present experience ask your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe and supported and knows what to do to relax if you simply allow the tension to release [Music] in addition to the added suffering that occurs when you resist the way things are you may also experience suffering when you are not accepting of yourself self-acceptance means accepting yourself exactly as you are without any wishes of how you should be there is a possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true the practice of self-acceptance is a step toward freedom and happiness in your life self-acceptance is knowing deep down in your heart that you are enough as you are it means being comfortable with your body your emotions and your mind it means accepting what you have achieved as well as what you have not yet accomplished acceptance of all your strengths as well as what you may consider your flaws it means being exactly who you are and not who you want others to see you as accepting yourself is not about praising yourself or receiving praise from others it means that you have a sense from within that you feel loved simply because you are being yourself [Music] when you love and accept yourself you are authentic and can trust yourself the first step on the path of self-acceptance is increased awareness as you build this awareness of yourself invite any feelings you may be having to show up fully welcome both positive and negative and honor what they are without judging or trying to change accept any positive emotions and know that you deserve to feel good [Music] and when negative emotions come to the surface treat yourself as you would a loved one with kindness and compassion [Music] know that these emotions are just that emotions they are not you they do not make you the person that you are [Music] notice your emotions as they show up for you now [Music] since the physical feelings of your emotions and where in your body you may be experiencing them notice with curiosity and acceptance experience your emotions just as they are let go of what you may think your thoughts or your emotions should be without changing anything simply meet yourself exactly where you are in the present moment and be aware of yourself the second step towards self-acceptance is loving-kindness and compassion for yourself in order to fully love and accept yourself you must let go of limiting beliefs and self-defeating behaviors let go of anything that no longer serves you on your journey to self-acceptance take a moment to let go of all the behaviors and beliefs that no longer serve you or are working against you [Music] there is no need to name these specifically right now simply let the negative energy go and replace it with positive energy make space for acceptance [Music] let go of judgments of ourselves and comparisons to others let go of unmet and unrealistic expectations let go of the need for perfection to be human is to be imperfect let go of comparisons with past versions of yourself let go of negative self-talk let go of shame and let go of guilt let it all go see all of this melting off of your body to be gone from your life forever without going into story or naming specific events let go of blame of ourselves and others let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders let go of blame of our circumstances let the sensation dissolve from your muscles [Music] let go of judgment of good and bad when we practice meditation we can choose to befriend our circumstances with compassion in a moment I will guide your subconscious with some positive affirmation statements of acceptance of reality as well as acceptance of self [Music] there is no need to repeat these if you are so relaxed you are almost sleeping your subconscious will hear them simply believe they are true continue to relax fully and know that at the core of your being these statements are true allow yourself to drift off to sleep with the sound of my voice if you wish through acceptance comes freedom and peace I allow my thoughts to be what they are I have the strength to accept what I perceive to be a challenge or an obstacle I trust that challenges will make me stronger I allow life to be exactly what it is I am loving and accepting of others I accept others as they are without trying to change them I accept the decisions of

1 you [Music] hello this is Sara Raymond and welcome to this meditation to help you increase your confidence and inner strength to prepare you for the day ahead today I will guide you into complete body and mind relaxation that can lead you into a deep sleep if you would like or if you are not ready to sleep you will be deeply relaxed before we get started make sure you are prepared to drift off to sleep when this recording is over if you would like take a moment now to turn off all distractions you can pause this recording if you like if there's anything you need to do to prepare yourself for safe and comfortable night's sleep know that you are safe and supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you choose to do so make yourself as comfortable as you can close your eyes and settle in for a deep productive night's sleep so you'll wake in the morning feeling rejuvenated and confident to start your day somewhere deep inside us all we know there is someone trying to grow to the surface our true self our higher self when we delve into self exploration we can see this person we know what direction we want to go for some of us the missing link is just the confidence to believe in ourselves enough to take action the confidence to live our life in alignment with what is truly important to us the last moments before sleep are so important to us they have a tremendous impact on how we start our next day when we wake up our thoughts pick up where they left off we can use this as an opportunity to give us the best chance to begin our day with a positive attitude and in alignment with our values and intentions this meditation is designed to help you drift off to sleep knowing you are going to have a great day [Music] confident to handle all that comes your way with a positive intention take a moment before we begin this relaxation process to set an intention for the day ahead the intention can be anything that resonates with you it may be a specific quality you would like to embody more in your life or an emotion you'd like to cultivate maybe you would like to focus on being mindful and staying in the present moment whatever intention is calling to you is fine [Music] once you have set your intention bring your awareness to the natural rhythm of your breath at first simply noticed the sensations that accompany your breath maybe you feel a slightly cool sensation as the air passes through your nostrils maybe you feel a floating sensation as your abdomen and chest rise and fill with breath or a heaviness as the air moves out of your body taking any attention with it maybe the breath brings a warming sensation to the body as it travels along its path whatever you're feeling is perfect simply observe the process begin to count the length of your breath in then as you breathe out invite the exhale to be one count longer than the inhale allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress or tension by exhaling just a little longer than you inhale your breath will slow your body and mind will calm down in response breathe in this way for a few more cycles then allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm [Music] in a moment I will guide you through a full slow body scan to take you deeper down into relaxation your body knows how to relax and sometimes a simple invitation to do so is all that it takes to release any tension pain or areas of gripping [Music] imagine that you can send your breath to any area in your body and the breath relaxes that area and make space for the energy to flow freely now as we begin to scan the body bring your attention first to the top of your head can you feel this area from the inside of your body as sensations only without moving your eyes as you scan the body simply move your awareness to each part and relax that part completely [Music] as you move your attention throughout the body you will scan for any areas of tension tightness or pain and if you find areas of tension stay on that part for a moment and send your breath into that area to soften it invite the breath to wash over any part wash away any tension like a way of moving over your body [Music] do not attach to the feelings of your body simply accept them as they are in this moment and ask your body to relax and release [Music] as you continue scanning your body you will feel this relaxing wave-like energy move through your entire body and it takes you deeper and deeper into a safe and supported state of sleep where you can build your confidence to live as your highest self [Music] and now move your attention from the top of your head down to your forehead and feel a sense of softening and smoothing [Music] continue to relax even deeper around the area of your eyebrows and eyes as you feel the tension from this area melt away your entire body softens a little further [Music] feel your eyelids becoming very heavy allow your cheeks to lengthen down and let go part your teeth unclench your jaw and relax your tongue the softening of your face and jaw will deepen the relaxation of your entire body [Music] you can now feel your throat softening notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper allowing this wave of comfort to continue its journey down your body you feel your chest and shoulders release and rest heavy every breath in oxygenate the body to promote healing and recovery from your day now allow the front and back of both arms to relax imagine water droplets flowing from your shoulders down your arms and out of your fingertips taking away all of the stress and tension that your body carries since the relaxing of the abdomen as it sinks down into the surface below you and now inviting the relaxation to continue its path down your body into your hips and lower back linger on this area a little longer and ask your body for a sense of ease let go of all of the tension and tightness held in this area feel your body softening as each breath in creates space for an easy flow of energy through your body this comfort moves into both of your legs washing relaxation over your thighs your knees your shins and your calves imagine again the droplets of water flowing out of your legs and feet washing away any remaining tension tightness or pain you feel as it flows out of your body through the bottoms of your feet so that you are completely relaxed throughout your entire body [Music] know that your relaxed body will allow for productive recovery while you sleep so you will awake feeling refreshed and rejuvenated and aligned with your intention [Music] you are now deeply relaxed and you can begin to use your imagination I will guide you on a journey taking you into a dream state where you can physically remain safe in your bed while your mind will travel to a special place of relaxation you can simply follow my voice or drift off to sleep whenever your body is ready [Music] today this journey takes you to a beautiful beach at dusk begin to imagine this Beach in vivid detail use all of your senses you can feel that the temperature is perfect for you look around at your surroundings you see the blue water [Music] it's crystal clear with gentle crashing waves you can see and hear these crashing waves and as they hit the shore each wave deep into your state of relaxation [Music] the rhythmic sounds of the flowing water brings you even deeper down into peace [Music] as you breathe in deeply you can smell the salty ocean air you can feel the warm sand under your feet as you continue to look around at this beautiful beach you see there are two chairs sitting under an umbrella off to your right and you decide to walk over to the chairs each step you take simply relaxes you even further ten you begin to walk over to the chairs and you are deeply relaxed you feel the tension melting away nine you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do you allow yourself to just be and drift off into a comfortable sleep eight notice how you are feeling calmer you are feeling a deep sense of relaxation you are beginning to feel sleepy seven you invite this blissful relaxed state to wash over you six you can feel your body begin the recovery and healing process that comes with deep sleep five letting go completely of the need to hold on to any tension or to guard physically for drifting deeper and deeper into the familiar heavy state of comfort three almost to the deepest level of relaxation before you fall off to sleep where your subconscious mind can build confidence - deep deep relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and heavy comfort [Music] now that you are relaxed and safe and you have arrived to the chairs you sense that there is someone special waiting for you sitting on the chair on the left the chair is facing away from you so you don't know who this will be or how they will appear you just have a strong feeling that someone is there this special person you may not recognize immediately it may have been a long time since you met it could also be someone you haven't met before but someone you know of this person is here for you they are here to help you gain confidence and inner strength they are here to offer you guidance you have a sense that this person knows what is in your heart and is here to support your best interest and now to satisfy your curiosity you walk around to sit in the chair on the right the chair next to this special person who is here for you you begin to recognize who is there you see their face slowly begin to come into focus this person may be someone you once knew and loved dearly or maybe this isn't a separate person it is simply part of you an important part that you haven't listened to before a part that knows you well and knows how you feel [Music] once you recognize this person or this part of you offer them a hug feel their warm embrace around you and take a moment to thank them for coming to see you today [Music] you have such a strong feeling that your visitor is here for you and will do the very best to help you find the confidence you need to live in alignment with your values and your highest self and although your guest has not yet said a word you already know that your visitor is here to offer guidance and support the presence and energy of your visitor is positive and fills you up with love confidence and gratitude sit with a special person for a while and soak up the energy

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to see your well-being and immune system strengthening as you drift off to sleep my name is Jason Stevenson and over the next short while I will guide you into a greater sense of peace health and well-being through mindful awareness and the power of visualization to settle into this practice let yourself find a comfortable lying down position [Music] whether on your back or on your side ensure that the spine is straight and your heart space is as open as is comfortable let your arms and legs soften into the surface beneath you and if you haven't already done so just closing your eyes just taking a moment here to feel into the bed or other surface that supports you and feeling a sense of gratitude for the comforts that you are provided with [Music] [Music] as remaining closed consider the roof over your head and the open air that surrounds you now visualize this open air as it becomes the breath entering into your nostrils as you inhale and being released from your body with each exhalation as you breathe mindfully let yourself soften further into the earth beneath you letting all unconscious and unnecessary tension begin to unravel [Music] as your body melts into a deeper state of relaxation the presence of stress hormones begin to decline and the immune system begins to strengthen naturally reflecting the symbiotic relationship between mind and body our physical well-being improves as we consciously and compassionately invite the mind into this present moment so take a few more moments now to witness the breath as it flows through you and with each exhalation let your bodies surrender more completely you might witness and soften the muscles around your eyes your jaw and tongue your shoulders and arms and your belly or any other part of you that feels tense in the same way that relaxing the mind promotes physical well-being relaxing the physical body encourages ease and release of the mind in a minute or two we will begin a visual journey of immune system strengthening but for now let's just take a few more moments to deepen the body's relaxation response first allow all the air in your lungs gently to be released to the atmosphere around you and together let's just take a deep full breath into the bottom of the belly and then slowly let it back out another long deep breath in and when you're ready let it back out one more full belly reaching breath now making it even longer this time and once you've reached the top slowly release all the air back out to the world around you let your breath come back to its natural rhythm now as you mindfully observe it for just a few more moments on your own now as we slowly transition into our visualization take a moment to draw your attention to the space before your closed eyes though the mind might conjure up images and ideas when left unchecked an open space of unlimited creative potential exists before the mind's eye when we slow down quiet down and tune in and it is upon this canvas now that I invite you to imagine yourself seated on a treehouse balcony overlooking a radiant singing rain forests of Central America [Music] the Sun glistens in the sky casting its light upon the treetops above you the air is warm and humid earthy and pure you take a long deep breath in and out feeling a strong but subtle wave of gratitude washed through you from where you sit or you can see is the untouched rainforest a sea of green spreading in every direction your gaze turns towards an intuitive understanding of the vitality and health of this rainforest rises to your awareness inspiring you to venture through this ecosystem to experience its restorative and healing potential and yet you take a moment now to notice how you feel in this very moment in these moments before heading on your way perhaps you feel tired perhaps you feel well or unwell perhaps you feel what you would call normal or average maybe numbness or discomfort whatever is the case view now ear on your perch above the rainforest simply notice it without attaching yourself to the feelings and sensations moving through you just notice what is here [Music] if there is any discomfort tension or unease send those sensations your love your care and your patience as you prepare for a journey into greater health vitality and immunity [Music] now you've heard that somewhere not far from the tree house lives a wise healer a mystical woman who knows all about the healing elements and herbs of this rainforest and who may be able to grant you with the greatest sense of health and well-being and so trusting your intuition to guide you in the right direction you pack a backpack with all the essentials you'll need for the day and then you begin your journey you start by climbing down from your treehouse rung by rung gently making your way onto the earth feet firmly rooted in the soil beneath you you take a moment to mindfully inhale the fresh nourishing rainforest air once again and as you exhale you take your first step down the foot path that leads you to the main road not far from your private perch in those natural lands the main road is humble and unpaved just a few metres wide it weaves its way quietly through the rainforest [Music] mindful step-by-step you make your way down it in the direction your heart guide you as you walk you note the silence between the forest symphony the air is both quiet and lively modest and confident birds call to you from the overarching canopy as does the breeze the cicadas and the howler monkeys the orchestra awakens you softening the rational and analytical mind as it guides you deeper into the beauty and mystery of the world you continued on for a short while until a path appears on your right-hand side as if silently calling you towards it you are drawn in its direction and so deciding to venture off the main road you take a leap of faith as you make your way down this narrow footpath into the unknown [Music] as you meander seemingly aimlessly you note that your body begins to shift shoulders begin to soften releasing knots of tension they have held onto for quiet some time now your belly begins to relax expanding and softening with each full deep breath your eyes begin to widen taking in more of the surroundings than they are accustomed to absorbing and your jaw begins to unclench sinking into greater comfort and ease [Music] your feet tread lightly as if kissing the earth and you sense yourself coming into greater alignment with the natural world you continue on for some time taking in the surroundings through open eyes is mind and heart great big beautiful flowers in magenta tangerine and lilac tones break up the pervading greenery of the forest meanwhile your ears continue to absorb the sounds of the nearby creatures frogs now chiming in alongside the cicadas birds and monkeys your expanded state of mind takes in the wonder of this incredible vibrant space reflecting upon how healing these natural ecosystems are how can it be you wonder that we have yet to truly learn from the wisdom of these natural ecosystems and then your heart fully expanded now takes in the love and beauty of this rainforest you feel an immense wave of gratitude wash through this loving energy center and so you silently offer a word of thanks to the natural lands you move across you thank them for providing you with just the sort of healing you had yearned for [Music] you continued on a little while further until another path comes into view this time is on your left-hand side and is even narrower than the one you are on your intuition tells you it is the path to take and so you turn down with confidence and curiosity the path weaves in and out of the tropical trees bringing you into even a closer contact with its wonder the broad leaves are close enough that they nearly brush your cheeks leaving you for a moment to question if you are going the right way and yet just as you begin to doubt the path you've chosen something opens up to you it is a small clearing in the forest in the center of it an elderly woman stands gazing up at the branches of the surrounding trees she's dressed in a long burnt orange dress and is wrapped in a loosely knit Shore the silver braided hair is wrapped in front of her left shoulder and as she stands there it seems as if she is whispering to the trees and then listening and whispering and then listening [Music] you cough quietly to let her know you were here completely unstart 'old by your presence she turns to you slowly and welcomes you with a warm smile you make your way towards her and she invites you to sit down on a long bench in the center of the clearing she sits next to you and asks what brings you here you begin to tell her that what you longed for is a greater sense of health and well-being particularly in the area of immunity you yearn for a system that is strong and resilient and you believe that perhaps this rainforest might hold what you need she embraces every word you speak and lets you know that it is possible to invite greater balance into your body through any and all acts of self-care including through the words and images you hold in your mind she invites you to begin by taking a dip in the healing blue lagoon just a short walk from her sacred circle and upon your return she will have concocted an herbal tea that will heal and balance your body and enhance its immunity you take her advice and follow the pathway she points you towards veering down a small hill and around a few more bends in the path you soon arrived at a break in the treeline we're turquoise waters reflect back at you from a short distance a small set of stairs guide you down towards the water's edge and as you step off the final stair you take a moment to absorb the fullness of this landscape you have never seen water so bright so clear so radiant after preparing to head into these cool and cleansing waters you inch your way slowly into the lagoon the water moves gently up your body until soon it has reached your waist you went to the water to as comfortable as you possibly can and if you choose to dunking your head under the water and up again [Music] the Sun is still high in the sky beaming down on you from its steady place there [Music] you close your eyes and surrender to the lagoon knowing that it will support you you take a full deep breath in and as you exhale you envision all heaviness or constriction and all imbalances leaving your body you take another full breath in and exhaling once again you envision yourself releasing all the thoughts all the ideas and all the physical imbalances that inhibit you from experiencing radiant health [Music] and now that space has been created within you for the new you consciously let your next inhalation fill you with the sun's healing energy it enters your lungs is a warm golden glow cleansing this part of the body's defense system completely then as the sun's golden light seeps further into your body it cleanses and brings balance to your lymphatic system your spleen your thymus your white blood cells and all other parts of your body's immune system [Music] as it spreads through you from within it continues to penetrate you from the outside as the Sun continues to beat down on your bare skin [Music] you spend a few more moments here soaking up the healing energy of the Sun off the breath and of the water you rest in knowing that only when all systems and elements are healthy can we experience true health and vitality [Music] when you were ready you slowly make your way back towards the shore drying yourself off with the towel and preparing to head back your entire body feels light and free full to the brim with energy and vitality you take the small pathway back to where you encountered the wise woman before she awaits your return with a fresh cup of a hot herbal tea the two of you hold silence as you bow your head and accept the mug she extends to you and as you let the warm immune-boosting liquid flow through you you trust that you already have and continue to come back into balance to come back to your innate capacity for strength vitality and resilience you pass back the empty mug and thank this woman for the blessings she has bestowed upon you and before you leave she reminds you to make sure that you prioritize your rest in the days and years to come rest of both body and mind she says is one of the most underrated and yet most important factors of a healthy internal defense system you smile thanking her once more and then you slowly head back in the direction of your very own tree house first you navigate your way down the narrow rainforest encroaching pathway towards the wider footpath then you follow this wider path until you arrive at the main road and the main road guides you back to the pathway up to your heart and before you know it you were resting on the hammock that swings on your balcony your entire body rests with ease and yet you can feel the awakened empowered energy that flows through you [Music] you remember the healing light of the Sun that entered your lungs as you floated in the turquoise lagoon and you sense its presence still within you and visioning yourself glowing from within just a few final moments and for just a few more final moments imagine the golden light of the Sun spreads through your entire being and as you slowly release the image of a healing glow within you also begin to dissolve the imagery of the rainforest [Music] [Music] coming back to the surface that supports you in this reality whether that be a bed a couch or something else you ground yourself affirmative ly back into this present moment notice the innate flow of your breath now continuing to nourish and cleanse you with each cycle follow its gently rhythm as you slowly let yourself drift into slumber

and peaceful state for sleep connect with the ease of your body your mind your spirit and your heart for a tranquil night's sleep when you wake many hours later you will experience a life of peace free of worry now i invite you to make yourself comfortable take a moment and make sure your environment is all set for you to safely drift into sleep settle into comfort for the night close your eyes and let this be a signal to your body to let go as your eyes close and you turn off the outside world you can invite your body to release any obvious tension or tightness perhaps soften the muscles in and around your eyes unclench your jaw and welcome this release to travel down your body relaxing your neck and shoulders next let your chest open [Music] and your belly soften welcome the heaviness of the relaxed state of your legs letting go completely into the surface below you sense any remaining tension from your day being released through the bottom of your feet to allow you to safely let go into tranquility become aware of where your body makes contact with the surface below you let this point of contact ground you [Music] feel this as support [Music] and allow yourself to be fully supported you are safe you can trust in the universe use this sensation of where you and your support meet to draw your awareness gradually from your outer experience to your inner world [Music] notice without judgment what your physical sensations are in this moment your body has the amazing ability to cope with challenges and to grow stronger from them if you allow and let go of resistance it is okay to befriend the fear that shows up for you fear is not the enemy it is a helpful and necessary emotion when it is channeled correctly as you continue to relax physically even deeper allow your attention to move inward to rest easily on your breath notice the air as it goes in and out through your nose feel your breath from within as it comes in and as it goes out like an ocean wave rolling into shore and back out again [Music] your attention on the wave of your breath will aid in deepening your peaceful state and allow sleep to easily come to you without any effort during any moments of silence if you find your mind wandering bring your attention back to your breath perhaps you may feel your stomach rise or your ribs expand as you breathe naturally or you may notice the feel of air passing through your nostrils whatever draws your attention [Music] about your natural breath let your attention easily linger here for another moment [Music] so [Music] while there are many things in life that you don't have control over your breath is one aspect that you can direct a little bit to continue relaxing and letting go even deeper invite your breath to lengthen begin to deepen your inhale for the next few cycles of breath and on your next exhalation release all the air completely letting go letting go letting go this full exhale will prepare your lungs to receive your next inhale each deep inhale brings in fresh oxygen each full exhale releases the stale air carbon dioxide and toxins each focused breath cycle is cleansing and healing you with each passing exhale you can say in your mind letting go and each release of air takes with it any tension and allows you to relax even deeper breathe in fresh oxygen breathe out letting go [Music] breathe in nourishing oxygen breathe out release any toxins or tension breathe in calmness breathe out stress breathe in light breathe out darkness breathe in love breathe out hate breathe in clarity breathe out confusion [Music] breathe in peace breathe out worry breathe in breathe out letting go allow my voice to be your guide into relaxation you can drift off to sleep when your body is ready and your subconscious mind will continue listening and relaxing like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow down in relationship to each breath as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen be in the gap no need to do anything simply be in this space [Music] as you continue to relax and drift towards sleep allow my voice to guide you into the most tranquil state where you are free and clear now in your mind imagine a place where you can be completely relaxed and free [Music] where you can be entirely at peace this might be a place where you have been to before or one that exists only in your mind if no specific image or visualization comes to mind easily you may consider the feeling or the energy of this space [Music] and this place is your personal sanctuary perhaps you might feel this freedom on a beach or a calm trail in the woods or maybe your mind takes you to a special place in your home whatever feels right to you is simply perfect this is your personal sanctuary it is your ideal spot for relaxation and peace see this special place in your mind's eye [Music] in as much detail as you can experience your sanctuary using all your senses as you rest in this personal peaceful sanctuary know that you are safe within yourself [Music] in this special place it feels good and safe to let go of worries let go of fears as if they simply dissolve into thin air to be gone from your life for good in this place powerful emotional healing takes place [Music] and will continue through the night as you sleep as you rest easy in your safe and peaceful sanctuary consider the times in life when releasing gives way to growth [Music] trees must let go of leaves in the fall to have the opportunity for new growth [Music] waves in the ocean flow in to the shore and back out again creating a natural ebb and flow many animals must shed their skin or outer layer in order to grow humans have a period of exhalation to make room for the next inhalation consider the times when resistance creates more difficulty for example the spinning wheels of a car in mud the more you try to get out the deeper the wheels dig into the mud can you find any areas where you are holding on and then let go [Music] perhaps you may be holding at the area of your stomach can you let go can you open the flow of energy within you continue to connect with relaxation and letting go as deeply as you can practice surrender practice letting go open to the healing energy within are you able to relax even more connect even deeper to yourself [Music] listen to your heart surrender to your inner wisdom let go of your body further and further into relaxation let go and drift effortlessly into peace let go of any thoughts of worry any thoughts that might be holding you back from experiencing tranquility let go of any thoughts holding you back from sleep [Music] see these thoughts drift off in the wave of relaxation they will be there when you need them in this calm state of your mind let go of worries so that you can sleep peacefully now what you resist persists acknowledge your thoughts with acceptance without the need to follow them into story meet your present experience with permission allow your thoughts to come and go without resistance welcoming a calmness to wash over you [Music] completely [Music] let go of anything you might be holding on to from yesterday or earlier today let go of anything that may be taking up space in your mind give yourself permission to be here right now sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission to let go of the past give yourself some space for something new something to grow into [Music] and now you have prepared your mind and your body for a deep peaceful and restful night sleep your subconscious mind is clear and free your mind and body are relaxed sleep is easily coming to you allow this to happen if you wish take the final steps into a deep restful slumber as you drift into dreaming sleep you will continue to experience a peaceful and calm mind and body as you drift into serene peaceful rest my voice will gradually disappear and you will be deeply asleep when you wake hours later your body and mind will continue to experience this amazing peaceful state you are so incredibly relaxed there is a sense of inner peace flowing through your body you are in the perfect place to get the best night sleep you will wake up tomorrow feeling rested and ready to move forward [Music] sweet dreams my friend [Music] so so so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music]

1 let go of limiting beliefs and replace them with positive beliefs as you sleep drift off to sleep in a peaceful state to enjoy the immense benefits of a night of deep nourishing sleep welcome to the mindful movement i'm sarah raymond and tonight it's time to relax as i guide you on a journey for complete body and mind relaxation and now i invite you to make yourself comfortable make sure you're ready to drift to sleep adjust your environment and posture so you can have the feeling of complete safety and support [Music] as we begin allow your eyes to close gently and begin to relax notice your breath now without making any changes to your breath recognize how it flows in through your nose and fills up your body with life [Music] follow the flow of the air as it comes into your body through your nostrils and notice how your chest and abdomen rise and fall naturally as the breath comes in and goes out the breath can be your anchor or your reminder to remain present with your experience when you focus on your breath you are always focused in the present you cannot get back a past breath and you cannot breathe in a future breath before the present moment as you continue to stay with your breath allow it to flow naturally release any physical and emotional tension with each exhale [Music] let any tightness drift away from your experience and now begin to deepen each breath in and out as your breath fills you up more fully focus your attention on the space that comes between the inhale and the exhale allow this stillness to last a little longer pausing momentarily between each inhale and exhale and as you breathe in this way for a few more cycles feel the tension easily release from your body give yourself permission to be fully supported safe and embraced by the nourishing energy around you you can be open to the possibilities of what comes with this state of comfort allow the sounds and the responsibilities of the world around you to turn off or be tuned out as you continue to relax you may still have thoughts going through your mind and that's okay notice them from afar as if you are an observer and invite the space between your thoughts to extend just as you did with the space between your breaths in just a moment i will guide you to continue this practice of awareness as you bring your attention to your physical body to deepen your relaxation

entirety of your body End mind our thoughts often when we wake of our dreams and we hold on the thoughts about the days behind and the days ahead of us so simply begin to observe from a place of non-attachment whatever you may be carrying in the physical body just gently witnessing any areas of tension or discomfort and in breath to nurture these areas take a few deep breaths into each area of the body calling for your attention and then gently release them allow your body to sink for a moment into complete stillness and silence you you in the same way now draw your attention to anything arising in the mind now there is no need to search for anything simply observe yourself open up to the thoughts that may be pre-existing they make themselves known just witness the nature of them the same way release them simply intangible ideas about what has come or what may be to come as you do this naturally notice yourself sinking further into this present moment sinking deeply into this waking day you whatever ideas you have about the day ahead I invite you to set them aside a short while you explore the moment you are presently in just notice through the physical body the surface that supports you you are seated on or the mattress you were lying on might be the floor quietly observe any sounds or physical sensations around you strong or subtle you and through your closed eyes notice if there's any sense of sunlight trickling in shadows dancing behind your closed eyes you as you come to mindfully explore the world around you there is silence and stillness begin to make note of the presence of day you just continue to allow the breath to guide you through this gentle awakening of the senses noticing how you are inextricably linked through the breath to the world outside of you allow each in-breath to nourish you and each breath out to free you of any constriction fatigue or even thoughts that may be lingering allow yourself to be nourished through the breath as you open your heart to this new day you you I invite you now to draw your awareness to your belly and as you do watch the way the breath flows in through your chest filling the entirety of your lungs causes the stomach to expand to rise and you might witness an expansion of the chest area as well an opening up of the heart space you if the mind wanders continue to simply invited back down and into the physical body wait for now simply embrace and enjoy these quiet moments of stillness presence and awareness allowing yourself to tune into the energy of a gentle a natural expansion that comes with sunrise you now from this place of complete awareness and presence tune into the heart space drawing your awareness to the center of the chest and allow your heart to expand as it expands

you find any anxious or fearful thoughts arise just witness them without becoming attached to them and gently focus back into your heart space or into the golden light radiating from this space within you you focusing now on your highest potential and visions for the day it might be goals that you want to achieve things that you want to set out to do or you need to do and allow any cluttering or limiting thoughts to naturally fall away and there is no need to force anything out of existence or to judge or condemn anything that might be arising less than your highest potential arises simply notice it acknowledge it and allow it to dissipate you whatever we envision on a regular we start to manifest in the outer world consciously reflect for a moment on whatever it is your highest self wishes to manifest in your life or more specifically in the day ahead what is the deepest yearning of your heart what is the energy you wish to carry with you throughout your day continuing to feel into the hearts glow and compassionately allowing conflicting mental chatter to subside as a higher truth reveals itself you begin to narrow in on what is it you wish to manifest considering for a moment that you already hold whatever it is you may take a few moments to breathe into this feeling as if it is already present within you allow your thoughts to be clear and conscious stemming from the core of who you are you might like to consider in the words of Rumi what you seek is seeking you just allow the openness of your heart to hold the truth that whatever you hope to embody is already here it is already present within you you just coming back to the body now and taking in a few more grounding breaths before setting a powerful intention for the day ahead allow yourself to be completely here truth to go and nothing you need to achieve as we increase our ability to be fully present and limiting thoughts begin to fall away and you begin to embody more deeply the truth of who you are silent and steady breaths here rooting yourself in the expanding energy of this morning you so from this place of pure presence but you now to set one more clear and powerful intention for your day consider whatever it is you wish to embody and state it to yourself as if it were already here for instance if you are longing is for self-confidence and esteem consider a phrase such as I am confident and complete or if the stability and safety are of your highest concern perhaps an affirmation like all of my deepest needs are being met just allow yourself to become very clear and focused on your intention as you begin to repeat it to yourself with each full breath so take a few moments of silence here as you align your intention with your breath letting the words fill you up entirely again and again but just a few moments you so wherever you are now resting come to notice once again with eyes closed environment around you feel into the physical support of the ground beneath you of the material world it has been manifested around you see if you can notice the air of the room that you are currently in sounds near far you take three more full breaths here knowing that you are unconditionally supported in this journey gently begin to soften the area around the eyes and when you are ready slowly open them up to the world around you noticing the delicate transition from dark to light as you move forward in outward action continually come back to the intention you are carrying within you knowing that the universe is here to support guide and nourish you with every step that you take
1 hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this guided meditation designed to help you ease into a deep and peaceful sleep while lowering your blood pressure naturally and effectively through mindfulness conscious breathing and deep body visualizations this meditation will create an inner experience of relaxation as well as guide the heart towards a healthy smooth and steady rhythm over the next short while allow my voice to guide you into this deep state of relaxation knowing that the hearts flow will follow suit as you sing further into stillness before we begin ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of any required alarms should be set and nothing else should remain on today's to-do list [Music] take some time now to settle into a comfortable lying down position

body now as you make any final adjustments that will support your progression into a deeply relaxed and peaceful state I invite you now to simply bring your attention to your breath without trying to shift it in any way just gently open your awareness to it observing its natural flow rhythm and depth [Music] notice the way the breath comes and goes on its own accord guided by innate wisdom that does not require any effort on your part it simply comes and goes just as the ocean eps and flows [Music] as you draw awareness to the breath notice if it naturally shifts in any way again there is no need to intervene or manipulate its rhythm but you may find that as you tune into the breath it might naturally deepen slow down or adjust itself in some other way just [Music] notice if this is true for you and also notice if it is not there is no right or wrong way to notice the breath simply observe it however it comes and follow it wherever it flows [Music] [Music] [Music] throughout this meditation the mind may entangle itself in thoughts of the past or in visions of what might come to be if for when it does simply acknowledge this tendency as a movement away from this present moment before drawing your attention back to the breath if thoughts arise simply witness them for a moment with compassion and non judgment before returning to your unchangeable Center no matter how frequently they crop up no that is entirely normal for thoughts to rise and entirely possible to gently let them go use the breath as your anchor at any point during this meditation to reground yourself in the physical place that you rest [Music] draw your awareness now to the stomach noticing its natural rise and for as breath moves through you in our busy day to day activities we often breathe primarily from the chest restricting our breaths range of movement this shallow breathing engages our stress response and releases a surge of hormones that temporarily increase our blood pressure [Music] as we naturally expand the breaths movement moving it effortlessly into the stomach we activate the relaxation response this deeper breathing pauses out of an inner state of stress and helps us to sink effortlessly into stillness and soon into a state of deep sleep continue to focus your attention on the stomach noticing just how far the breath can go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] take a moment now to acknowledge this physical place you are in without engaging the Mayans and our living capacity is it possible to simply witness the space you occupy to witness the physical world you are intimately connected to [Music] notice the service that supports you and notice any soft textures around you draw your awareness to this very simple moment knowing that there is nowhere else you need to be you are nowhere else but right here right now and all that is asked of you is that you open your heart and awareness to this beautiful moment before you fall into a deep and restorative sleep [Music] [Music] [Music] as you notice your physical surrounds you may also become more deeply aware of your physical body maintain awareness of the breath flowing through you as

whatever exists within you [Music] [Music] [Music] if any tension or discomfort appears in your awareness simply embrace it with your loving awareness and open your breath up to this area that is calling for your tender love and care if there are no strong sensations to notice simply grant your entire body with your compassionate attention and let it melt further into stillness [Music] [Music]

deep breaths here [Music] envisioning this process that is moving through you inhale relaxation and exhale any remaining tension in the body or mind [Music] [Music] I invite you now to draw your awareness to the heart space and to invite your breath into it breathe slowly and steadily here filling the heart completely on each inhalation and softening it on each exhalation [Music] come to notice the steadiness of the heart space it's slow flow and its openness as you breathe you bring the heart into greater harmony and equilibrium [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to slow down even more and to further this process of relaxation begin to add counts of four to your breath on your next inhalation breathe in to a slow counter for pause for a brief moment at the top and then exhale for a full count of four take three full breath cycles here following this guidance if it feels comfortable to you [Music] [Music] [Music] envision the heart slowing its pace and vision it relaxing completely into this moment it is beating naturally and effortlessly without you needing to intervene in any way simply by slowing the breath the heart follows suit simply by engaging in mindful breathing mind body and heart all come closer to complete relaxation as you settle into a sense of the heart beating slowly and steadily start to expand your field of awareness by imagining the pathways that flow into and away from the heart [Music] envision the life force that travels through your heart pumping smoothly and effortlessly this life force your blood nourishes your cells as it flows steadily through your body know that without any effort without any force or manipulation the body is nourishing itself in this very moment open your heart a little bit further with each full breath knowing that you are being supported by the body's innate wisdom right now [Music] [Music] [Music] continue to expand the breath envisioning and traveling throughout the entire body where attention goes energy flows [Music] as you expand your awareness to encompass the entire physical body life force in all its forms follow in that direction [Music] watching the breath flow steadily know that your blood is traveling in the same manner effortlessly extensively and wholeheartedly as you sink further into stillness trusting the body's wisdom [Music] the heart continues to beat

release everything held in the mind any visions thoughts or any mental chatter that may have crept up release it all on your next exhalation [Music] as you let go gently imagine the mind dropping down to the heart space slowly unfastening itself from the headspace passing through the space between your brows down the nose through mouth and throat and landing softly in the heart [Music] without creating any visions thoughts or feelings of what this looks like simply hold your awareness in the heart and explore what it feels like to be in this space continue to breathe deeply through the heart [Music] [Music] in a moment we will enter into a few moments of silence you may choose to retain your breath as your anchor and focus for these moments or if it suits you you may introduce the following information on each inhalation as we sink into silence you may quietly repeat to yourself I am flowing and on each exhalation you may repeat I am releasing I am flowing I am releasing I am flowing I am releasing invite this affirmation into your heart now or simply continue to breathe from the heart with your awareness focused on your breath [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now gently

still be moving through you as you come quietly into pure beingness as you slowly drift into sleep there is nothing you need to carry with you so begin to shed any remaining thoughts now simply

have within they continue to slowly fall towards you almost like some scene from an imaginary fairy tale it's almost as if you could reach out right now and you could touch them these stars are

moment there is nothing view to figure out in the mind nothing for you to anticipate or fear simply draw your attention back to the breath as the mind wanders knowing that you are entirely supported by my voice the music and the universe it is safe for you to slowly and gently let go come back now to your breath and again draw your awareness to your stomach as your attention shifts to this deeper area of the chest cavity your breath will naturally follow along take three full breaths here and with each one notice your entire body becoming more expansive notice your mind and body getting lighter and lighter allow the mind to sink further and further into the heart until nothing remains but a vast openness as clear as pale blue sky [Music] now begin to imagine that you were looking up at this expansive blue sky from a beautiful open field you are resting in the center of it comfortably with cushions and blankets observing the freedom inherent in this natural landscape wildflowers grow abundantly throughout the sea of green that surrounds you [Music] above you is a nearly cloudless sky and a warm Sun that invites you to breathe a little bit deeper and you do breathing in the pure air of the world around you you are feeling completely at ease within this landscape your breath flows smoothly and deeply as you allow the physical world to support you here [Music] overhead something begins to appear out of the distance as it makes its way closer to the air space directly above you you come to see that it is an eagle soaring freely across the clear blue sky take a few moments to observe the smooth curves it makes as it wings and carves its way through the air it is both strong and light moving with both confidence and grace the Eagle continues to dance through the sky as it makes its way closer and closer to the earth it appears to be approaching the very field you rest in but nothing about its approach frightens you in some strange way you feel that this bird is no different from you and you know deep in your gut that in no way can it harm you in fact the eagle brings you a sense of inner peace courage and lightness you've heard much about Eagles knowing that their presence is an invitation to move deeper into freedom soaring high above the sky Eagles suggests to us that now might be the time to look at things from a new perspective these birds grant confidence and courage to look ahead they symbolize new beginnings self growth and personal awareness as you observed the Eagles flight you are blessed with its wisdom feeling refreshed and renewed [Music] you witness the eagle landing on the soft earth beside you as you rise to your feet to welcome its arrival the two of you meet eyes and then bow your heads in respect of one another with the great eagle just before you you stretch your arm out to touch its soft code noticing how calm and relaxed it is within this environment and in your presence the eagle is free unbounded by fear and anxiety as it welcomes your tender touch it reminds you that you too have nothing to fear breathing deeply soaking in this sense of freedom and on your next exhale you release all residual tension that lingers in body and mind you are complete at peace with this great bird knowing that in fact you are one and the same [Music] [Music] the Eagle takes one last look at you and turns preparing to take off once again preparing to set sail in the clear vast blue sky as the great bird turns its head you realize that by some divine magic you have become this eagle gazing up towards the open sky you realize that it is you who is preparing to take off to release everything that tethers you to the physical world to soar high above the earth free and unbounded the Eagle came for just a moment to show you that her way is your way that nothing stands in your way of experiencing what it feels like to be entirely free and suddenly in the midst of this realization you lift off from the security of the earth to experience a complete lightness in your being you saw ever lessly above the planet extending your arms with the same strength and grace shown to you by the Eagle that had once been with you now it is you now you are the eagle entirely free and unbounded by any and all earthly concerns within this incredible open stretch of clear sky you set yourself free you are entirely at peace with this present moment [Music] [Music] as you witness yourself floating effortlessly through this open air you feel nothing and everything no worries no fears and no attachments and yet you feel harmonious with everything around you you are in a state [Music] eat of deep peace as you allow yourself to surrender completely to the lightness of the universe around you [Music] take a few more full breaths here deeply into the belly as you allow yourself to revel in this moment there is nowhere else you need to be but right here grant yourself this time to be full be at peace and fully supported by the universe around you you are fully supported here unconditionally [Music] [Music] slowly you begin to feel yourself coming back down to earth with the energy of the Eagle ingrained deep into your cells you know that you carry this energy of freedom wherever you go whether high above the earth or nestled into the comfort of your own bed with each exhale you sink a little bit further back down to earth back down to the surface that supports you in this very moment you settle now back into the earth gently releasing all visualizations of the Eagle the sky and the abundant field you once rested in even though you have returned to this physical space you still carry the wisdom of the eagle deep inside yourselves the feeling of being entirely free lingers within you come back once again to the breath bringing your attention now to the heart inside this space in your chest you may envision a warm white light beginning to appear with each breath it grows expanding softly and swiftly to touch each cell of your body soon your entire body is bathed in this warm white glow as you feel yourself letting go of this day completely as you feel yourself inching closer and closer towards sleep [Music] the light begins to dim having cleansed your body and mind entirely this dimming invites you into a deeper and peaceful sleep allowing you to rest completely throughout another night you feel yourself sinking further and further into the surface beneath you everything within you that does not support your sense of relaxation has been released there is nothing else for you to do nothing else to be envisioned or thought of you are entirely at peace as the steady rhythm of your breath rocks you closer and closer towards a deep and nourishing sleep [Music] welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to find peace and inner tranquility before you naturally fall into a deep and restorative sleep over the next short while you'll be guided to relax the body and ease the mind before being led through a visual journey into a mystical cave of peace it's your time to allow yourself to be carried away gently through this journey knowing that you are entirely supported in this present moment so take a moment now to ensure that all end of day activities have been wrapped up alarms should be set and liens drawn you I invite you now to come into a comfortable lying down position ensuring that your body is resting with ease wherever you are you might want to use blankets or cushions to support you as you find comfort in the physical space you occupy take a few releasing breaths here allowing a deep sigh to leave your body on your next outward breath [Music] to begin our journey into tranquility take a moment to observe that the stillness of your physical body [Music] as day transforms into night and the Sun fades away we are invited to enter a much needed period of rest and rejuvenation as we sink into the stillness of night rest assured there is nothing we need to consciously engage in or take care of we can trust that the body will work by its way of its innate wisdom so take a moment now to quietly observe the miracle of this body feel into its heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you you might want to notice now where there might still be movement despite the sense of stillness notice where breath brings subtle movement to the body how it causes the chest and stomach to expand on each inhalation and to fall away on each exhalation [Music] observe how beautifully this gentle movement intertwines with a deeper sense of complete stillness as you take a few deep breaths here in silence [Music] [Music] if thoughts arise in the mind no that is entirely natural for them to do so as you become aware that your attention has shifted into stories about the past or future simply acknowledge these thoughts from a more distant place than is habitual [Music] while the mind can be useful at times it can lure us into an unproductive thought cycles when left to run on its own terms as we begin to witness our mental movements from a higher or broader vantage point we practice our power of discernment easing challenging thoughts and emotions as we experience greater clarity and a sense of peace as you journey through this meditation keep this sense of distance in mind as thought arises and return to your breath as an anchor when needed [Music] [Music] move now further into breath awareness as you practice holding your attention on this anchor that is always available to you [Music] notice the breaths rhythm its pace and its depth as you move alongside it in both directions hold for a brief pause just a second or two and at the end of each inhalation and each exhalation finding brief moments of complete stillness within each breath cycle [Music] you [Music] allow the mind to gently subside as you become more attuned to the present moment attachment to worried anxious or distracting thoughts can be released as you practice being the observer of whatever is moving through you just allow yourself to sink further and further into this very moment entering naturally into a state of full-bodied ease and tranquility [Music] with your eyes remaining closed tuned into the space between the eyebrows just in front of your mind's eye envision in this space of vast emptiness something like a clear night sky sink into this infinite abyss of space and silence for a few moments as you prepare to enter into a cave of complete peace and tranquility as you gaze with eyes closed into the empty sky in front of you envision your view dotted with infinite sparkling stars you are in an open outdoor space surrounded by the open air lakes rivers and mountains the moon is high and full [Music] tune into your breath for a few moments noticing the freshness of the air that fills you [Music] just follow my voice for a few breaths here as you inhale deeply breathing in a sense of being completely at ease and exhale slowly releasing any tension or stress in body or mind inhaling again visualizing yourself filling up with peace and ease and exhale fully releasing anything that no longer serves your movement towards complete relaxation breathing deeply once more filling yourself with the freedom and freshness of outdoor air and exhale completely releasing all tension to be transformed by the starlit sky returned gently to your natural breath allowing your mind to refocus on the empty space in front of your mind's eye though night has fallen upon this outdoor landscape the land is lit by stars and moonlight granting you with enough light to see the curves of the earth take a moment now to simply observe the way the rocky mountain faced peaks and Falls and the way rivers and lakes gently caress the hard surface of the earth notice how peaceful it is here beneath the night sky as you feel yourself coming into complete harmony with the natural world [Music] from where you stand you see an empty cavern not too far away illuminated by the full moon above its spaciousness its emptiness cause you towards it so you begin to walk slowly and mindfully towards the sheltered space within the mountain notice the way your feet effortlessly move across the earth you feel completely at home in this natural landscape as you move towards the cave that beckons you quietly as you reach the opening to this wondrous cave your original sense that it rests unoccupied is confirmed there is no one here but you know plant life inside and no animals the only thing that you have yet to sense within this cave is a deep stillness it is completely silent and yet something about it is calling to you in the faintest whisper recognizable only by your heart by the entrance of the cave there is a candle placed here by some universal force for whoever might come to rest here you light the candle with a match that has also been provided and quietly make your way inside the dark cavern fear anxiety and worry are completely absent all that is present within you is a growing calmness he reached the center of this mystical cave that has called you into it setting your candle in the center and bringing yourself to rest comfortably on the floor lying on your back you stare up at the ceiling noticing the incredible edges carved by nature breathing deeply and feel entirely at peace in this open and empty space [Music] silence surrounds you as the mind rests in a deep state of peace and tranquility your breath continues to flow through you effortlessly and gracefully [Music] yet within this vast silence something in this cave is speaking to you the mind cannot decipher it but the heart knows that there is a great wisdom radiating out from these walls you listen more intently to this language still foreign to the mind and find that your heart begins to open up the serenity of this space softens your heart as a deep trust infiltrates your entire being in this serene state you find a calm and the quiet sense of courage to ask this cave any questions that might arise from your purest heart as you allow your heart to ask these wise walls any questions that arise you find that the questions themselves are infused with trust rather than with fear and anxiety your heart speaks calmly and quietly the mind resting peacefully in the background and as you listen closely with your heart remaining open you find that the walls speak back in silent whispers gently wisely and compassionately this is the language of the heart and you open yourself to it completely [Music] you do not have to search for any answers you trust that they will come in their own time patience and peace arise within you [Music] you [Music] the cave sends its wisdom enough form of whispers visions and inner sensations though not all at once this mystical cave knows that some answers require extra time to be revealed and that when the time is right the answers will be provided you open your heart even wider sinking further into the peaceful and serene energy of this cave spend a few more silent moments listening to the wisdom of the wars that surround you the mind remains quiet as the heart remains receptive [Music] coming now to a deeply settled state you turn your head to blow out the candle that is beside you your mind is calm your heart is warm and your spirit is nourished notice a deep trust arising within you a completely calm presence radiates throughout your entire being all at once there is no separation between you and this mystical cave an overwhelming sense of oneness comes over you [Music] [Music] as you sing further and further into this deep tranquility of darkness your body returns to the physical reality of the room that you rest in witness the surface now your body rests on observing quietly all the tangible items supporting you here and now feel into this supremely calm state allowing your breath to rock you closer and closer towards sleep all images melt away from the heart and mind as you come back to a place of deep physical presence notice the air around your body the warmth of blankets and cushions the heaviness of your limbs your torso your head and the rest of your body [Music] each breath travels deeply into your lungs transporting vital life energy to every cell of your body you can rest with ease knowing that as you sleep this process is being taken care of by the body's innate wisdom there is nothing else for you to do nothing else for you to ask think believe or create all that the heart yearns for now is this deep sense of peace and contentment to carry you into a peaceful night's sleep as you breathe your conscious awareness begins to melt away asleep comes to restore your entire being continue to follow the breath quietly and effortlessly until everything slips away soon you will enter into a peaceful slumber where the caves mystical energies will replenish you entirely mind body and heart [Music] welcome to this bedtime meditation designed to promote more peaceful and soothing dreams whether you have experienced difficult dreams lately or an absence of dreams this meditation will help to set the stage for beautiful imagery to visit you as you sleep while listening to this meditation simply allow your body to rest and your mind to expand as you drift into beautiful places using the power of your attention so now I ask you to take a few deep breaths opening yourself to this powerful practice of visualization before we set the stage for better dreams to come to you let's take a journey into the body and mind exactly as it is now to prepare I invite you to make yourself entirely comfortable lie down in any position that is comfortable to you however you rest remain mindful of keeping the neck in line with the spine to help promote a sense of openness and relaxation within the body proper posture even when sleeping helps to promote positive feelings that will carry over into sleep making any final adjustments necessary just allow yourself to come into a state of complete stillness the only observable movement now should be the breath as it makes its way through the body opening the chest and expanding the belly [Music] as you witness your body coming into stillness notice how the breath naturally slows itself [Music] you might even allow a deep sigh of relief to leave the body on an exhalation releasing any unnecessary tension or concern that lingers in your body [Music] [Music] begin to open your senses up to the world around you beginning with your ears start to become mindful of the quiet space that is around you and of any sounds that pass through this sense of stillness when opening the ears there is no need to search for noises or to label any sounds that arise simply observe whatever is going on around you through your sense of hearing [Music] [Music] [Music] become aware now of the physical space you reside in noticing the sensations of the surface beneath you of any cushions or blankets above or against you notice if there is any particular sensation of the air around you does it appear to be still or in flow is it cool warm or possibly neutral just allow your physical body and its capacity to feel the ground you deeper into this present moment [Music] [Music] I invite you now to move a little further into the body following the movement of air into your lungs tune in to the sensations of it as it enters and leaves you as the belly rises and as it falls without attempting to change the breath in any way allow it to carry you further into the experience of inner stillness even amidst its constant flow [Music] allow the physical body to settle reaching a point of complete ease and comfort if you feel it is necessary to adjust your position in any way just move slowly and mindfully as you come into a place of deeper comfort [Music] [Music] take a moment now to observe the mind you might find that thoughts and associated feelings linger beneath the surface of an otherwise very still state if thoughts are present simply observe them from a place of compassion and non judgment just see if it's possible to observe them as an outsider without becoming consumed by the stories they tell and then return your attention to the breath [Music] at any point you can use the breath as a tool to draw you back into a present state of awareness when we draw our attention to the mind during meditation we might find that enchanting visuals accompany the stories we tell the point of this meditation is not to banish or look down upon this imagery that we create unconsciously meditation is simply a call to become more conscious and mindful of what is happening inside of our heads the mind is a powerful tool that can either entrap us in imagery informed by fear or that can be used to enhance our lives and create more positive beliefs ideas and dreams take a few moments now to practice being an outside observer of thoughts and imagery that appear in the mind simply become more attuned to the way that your thoughts give life to your visions knowing that you hold the power to turn your attention away from any storyline that is guided by fear worry or anxiety [Music] rather than force your thoughts to become something you might deem to be more positive take this time to let all thoughts dissolve continue to focus on the breath moving through you as you sink further and further away from mentor distractions [Music] [Music] [Music] with each inhalation you might envision yourself being infiltrated with lightness peace and contentment and with each outward breath you can imagine that all negative and unconstructive thoughts and beliefs are being released allow yourself to become completely at ease within this present moment [Music] take another moment to feel into your physical body knowing that you are entirely supported in this moment physically emotionally and spiritually and that even through this simple act of slowing down you are beginning to invite more positive dreams into your evening sleep from this deep sense of underlying stillness I invite you now to use the power of your mind to enter a visual place of peace beauty and serenity there are no rules as to what this place should look like so long as it brings you a sense of inner peace the place you choose might be a beach a mountain range a lake or somewhere further afield perhaps somewhere far into outer space this is your vision take a few moments now to settle on your preferred location allowing it to enliven itself in your mind's eye commit your awareness to building this peaceful space in your mind allow it to expand naturally alongside your growing sense of inner tranquility build it using the blessing of all of your five senses [Music] unioned your sense of sight first allowing your visual sense to build this place of your truest dreams [Music] what colors and textures are present to the eyes other animals plants or other humans around you here what does the sky look like from where you look out what elements are present [Music] simply tuned into the visual presence of fire earth water and air if any or all of these are present [Music] allow your creation of this space to include your sense of sound is it completely silent where you are or are there subtle noises present possibly there's a recognizable beat or rhythm in any sounds that might be growing in this space or are the sounds disorderly like the unpredictable pitter-patter of rain simply allow that whatever brings you peace to arise in this place of beauty [Music] tuning in now to your sense of smell are there any recognizable aromas that are present here from the smell of salty water to fresh earth and autumn leaves allow nature's aromas to trickle into this imagery you are resting within and if nothing arises that is fine too there are no rules to what your mind creates so long as it brings you comfort consider your sense of taste now allowing your experience here to delight your taste buds as you explore this peaceful landscape is there anything that you feel compelled to taste you might want to indulge in wild berries in pure spring water or in some of a worldly treat born in outer space just allow your experience to be rich divine and fulfilling nourishing your entire being and as you explore this place either walking slowly through it or from a resting position allow yourself to feel into it through your physical body what nourishing surfaces does your body come into contact with how does the air feel against your skin thus the Sun or moon beamed down on you filling you with a sense of ease and enchantment just allow whatever brings you deep peace to express itself here [Music] now I invite you now to tune into this place you have created with a sixth sense that is with your hearts feeling as you breathe and vision your heart expanding with each inhalation and softening with each exhalation [Music] with each breath allow your heart to open up to the piece you have just built within you let this space nourish your innermost being wholeheartedly take a few more moments to allow yourself to play rest or recharge in this beautiful and tranquil environment you have conjured use each of your senses including your heart to explore this moment as fully as possible [Music] [Music] in this very moment you feel a deep sense of care love and support granted to you by the universe by the beautiful space you have created and by your highest self and clearest mind [Music] everything in this space and time is exactly as it is meant to be and you feel highly attuned with all that is around you slowly I invite you now to gently release the imagery you have created letting go of the taste and texture and the sights and sounds gently release your vision of this beautiful place knowing that in some way on some other field of reality it is still very present within you even as the images fade away you maintain the heartfelt sensations this visualization opened you up to inside of you there is a deep sense of peace beauty and contentment [Music] come back now to the breath watching it flow gently and steadily through you [Music] you as you return to this physical reality that you are in you begin to feel more grounded and present within your environment there is a deeper sense of that inner stillness you know is always within you so take a moment to draw your awareness through the body blessing the entirety of your physical being with deep rest and relaxation release any constriction in the belly the chest area soften and loosen the jaw release [Music] and your forward allow the entire body to relax completely as you prepare to enter the dream world [Music] as you settle into a state very close to sleep little pieces of your peaceful paradise linger in the back of your mind unconsciously through the power of this visualization you have set the stage for beautiful dreams to carry you through the night ahead all tension worry and fear have melted away and in its place nothing but lightness and peace remains allow your breath to continue rocking you to sleep alongside each breath cycle you might silently repeat this following affirmation until slowly this awakens state drifts away my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with beautiful visions keep your heart and mind wide open your body rooted in a sense of inner peace and harmony and allow the infinite possibilities for beauty to infiltrate your dreams continue whispering silently my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with beautiful visions until this wish becomes a slumbering reality [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome to this guided meditation to help you release all muscular tension and to help you fall into a deep and peaceful sleep over the course of this meditation you will be guided to bring your awareness to each area of the body to feel into it to tighten it and then to release it completely allowing the entire body to come to a state of total relaxation so before we begin this journey just ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of if you require an alarm to be set just quietly set it now if there are blinds that need to be drawn or bright lights that can be turned off just take care of these small matters before settling into a comfortable lying down position you [Music] wherever you are ensure that the spine and neck are straight but relaxed and that you are supported in any way that you need take your time to adjust any cushions or blankets so that you are as comfortable as possible in this very moment [Music] set an intention now to fully let go through both body and mind as we enter a process of complete release [Music] you now let's begin by becoming more mindful of this exact moment in time and space begin by drawing your awareness to your ears and to all the sounds that you may currently be infiltrating through them as you open your hearing simply observe all the sounds that come from subtle hums to more prominent noises outside [Music] without judging or labeling these sounds practice remaining in a state of deep awareness as vibrations filter into your eardrums and as they disappear [Music] [Music] allow the Mayans tendencies to categorize to label and the judge to step aside as you simply witness these noises as dynamic expressions of life as simple and subtle vibrations of energy now expand your awareness of this present moment by beginning to observe the physical space you rest in notice the air that touches your skin and the material world that supports and surrounds you take a few moments to observe each inch of your body that is in contact with the physical world you might come to notice the temperature of your body and surfaces around you you might observe the textures of blankets and pillows that brush against your skin and you might even observe a barely describable feeling of support of safety or of heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you [Music] notice if the body's formation or sensory experience changes in any way as you become more mindful of this physical space you are in [Music] become more mindful now of your breath quietly observing the rhythm and depth of its present form [Music] [Music] to be mindful does not mean to change or to manipulate the present moment in any way that the mind deemed to make better or worthy to the contrary mindful awareness asks us to open to and to accept this moment exactly as it is so with this in mind see if you can open to your breath exactly as it is right now releasing any judgment or expectation for it to feel any differently and it presently does [Music] you if a natural deepening occurs allow this simply noticing it as a natural movement of energy further into your being continue to observe the breath for a few more moments feeling into the expression of each inhalation and each exhalation notice the feeling of air entering through your nasal cavity filling your lungs and pressing upward against your belly and then notice the same dynamic movement in Reverse observing any sensations connected to your fall exhalation [Music] just breathe here in mindful awareness for a few more silent moments [Music] if the mind wanders at any point during this meditation see if you can refrain from judgment as you compassionately call your attention back to the present moment it is in the mines nature to wander but with that said we can use the power of our intention to refocus our attention back on this present moment this refocusing is what helps us to enter an expanding state of complete of relaxation in just a few moments we will enter into a full-body scan through which you will become deeply aware of the presence of tightness in the body and then of the feeling of complete relaxation you will be guided to witness tighten and release each area that we pass allowing each part of the body that come to deep rest and complete ease in preparation for a peaceful night's sleep [Music] as much as possible see if you can align tightening movements with your inhalations and all movements towards release with your exhalations just breathe naturally in between each muscle group that we work on so before we begin into this body scan I invite you to make any adjustments now that will help you to feel into the entirety of your body you might find that it is easiest to access each muscle when in a straight line down position on your back however if this is not comfortable for you come into a position that is as neutral as possible while remaining comfortable [Music] ensure that the chest is open with shoulders drawing away from the ears allow your breath to continue to be in the background of your awareness secondary only to your gently shifting awareness of the physical body so begin by noticing your toes feeling into them exactly as they are in this moment [Music] notice if there are any sensations present any tightness or softness [Music] and now consciously tighten just your toes on your next inhalation observing what it feels like for them to be pulled inwards completely and then exhale letting them go and allowing all tension melting away with these now bring your awareness towards both feet toes and ankles included [Music] observing them exactly as they are in this moment on the next breath in tense all muscles in the feet area holding tightly for just a brief moment and then release all of the tension on your exhalation allowing your feet toes and then goes to rest back down completely and breathing normally for a few moments [Music] [Music] observe now the presence of both of your legs drawing your awareness all the way from your heels up to your hips noting any sensations you pass along the way hold the entirety of both legs in your awareness and then inhale as you tighten these muscles squeezing them in towards your midline hold there for a moment and then exhale releasing them completely into the surface beneath you [Music] moving to the area between the hips draw your awareness to your pelvis on your next breath in tighten all of these muscles holding them for just a brief moment and then release them completely on your next breath out just feeling to this complete release from your pelvis downward letting each of these areas sink further into the support of the physical world observe the stomach region now becoming aware of its present state [Music] and then as you inhale tighten all of these core muscles holding them in tightly for just a moment as you hold the breath in and then release entirely as you exhale softening all muscles around the belly return to your natural breathing rhythm as you relax the stomach completely now expand your awareness of the stomach to encompass the entire torso from lower back to upper and from belly up to the shoulders take a moment now to observe each muscle group in the core of your body [Music] now on your next inhalation tighten them or towards the midline of your body feeling them in a contracted state and then release heavily with a sigh allowing your entire torso to relax completely [Music] take a moment here to reconnect with your breath mindfully observing its present form bring your awareness now to your hands fingers included observe the way they are resting in this moment noticing if they are relaxed or tense or somewhere in between as you inhale allow all of these muscles in the hands and fingers to tighten coming into a compressed fist hold for a brief second or two and then exhale as you release allowing both hands to rest completely relaxed draw your awareness now from your wrists all the way up to your shoulders and compasses and areas in between so inhale as you contract all of these muscles perhaps pulling them up towards your ears and then soften releasing all of these muscles in the limbs back down shoulders falling back down gently as well notice how different it feels in both body and mind between your contracted States and your softened ones now begin to observe all of the intricate muscles in your face noticing if there are any sensations present here [Music] consider the muscles in your jaw your cheeks your eyebrows and your forward now inhale as you contract all of these muscles squeezing your entire face together hold for just a moment observing the sensation and then exhale as you release all of these muscles completely let go of each muscle allowing all tension to drain away take a moment to come back to your breath for just a moment observing the entire body right where it is and right as it is [Music] observe this neutral state just for a moment and then on your next inhalation contract every muscle group accessible to your awareness squeezing the entirety of your body towards your midline hold everything together with the breath held in and then release completely letting a deep sigh escape from your lungs as all remaining tension and stress falls away allow each muscle to melt into the surface beneath you allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm as you sink further and further into the experience of this complete relaxation [Music] continue to breathe naturally mindfully observing the flow of air into and out of your being in this state of deep relaxation and release there is absolutely nothing to do but be entirely present with every muscle group relaxed completely you are moments away from drifting into a peaceful sleep that is in alignment with your present state of tranquillity allow your breath to become like waves your body is soft and gentle as the water beneath the surface as you breathe notice yourself being rocked gently into an even deeper state of tranquillity the mind follows

with a flowing attention all the way down to the soles of your feet as your attention flows from one part of your body to another pause and linger on any areas that seem to be asking for your attention give each of these sensations the notice that it is needing your physical body is your anchor or your reminder for this meditation so if you find that your mind has wandered off into a story or thoughts about something else lovingly bring it back to the current experience of your sensations notice any areas of your body where you are experiencing feelings and simply be with the sensations without labeling good or bad or telling a story of why these sensations are here stay with the felt sense of the sensation and let go of your ideas about it welcome anything and everything you are feeling be with the actual experience of your body and let go of your resistance to this experience what would it be like for you to encourage a release a letting go of any tension as you move your

for your body right now breathe this in stay with the good the positive sensation that is already within you is an opening for your attention go through the opening and invite in more of what is good offer each and every part of your body love and compassion you may find it difficult to send love to an area of chronic pain or dis-ease that is okay do your best to be with everything that is part of you acknowledge the messages your body is sending you and nurture yourself with love stay with the sensations continue to build the ease softness and peace within you send gratitude and love to each and every part of your beautiful body heart and soul what would it feel like to let go in any way that brings you deeper into comfort are there any areas that you can relax further maybe you sense a shift as you allow your body to sink down into the surface beneath you let gravity settle over you there is no need to hold against it anymore there is no need to carry the weight of the world on your

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this bedtime meditation designed to promote more peaceful and soothing dreams whether you have experienced difficult dreams lately or an absence of dreams this meditation will help to set the stage for beautiful imagery to visit you as you sleep while listening to this meditation simply allow your body to rest and your mind to expand as you drift into beautiful places using the power of your attention so now I asked you to take a few deep breaths opening yourself to this powerful practice of visualization before we set the stage for better dreams to come to you let's take a journey into the body and mind exactly as it is now to prepare I invite you to make yourself entirely comfortable lie down in any position that is comfortable to you however you rest remain mindful of keeping the neck in line with the spine to help promote a sense of openness and relaxation within the body proper posture even when sleeping helps to promote positive feelings that will carry over into sleep making any final adjustments necessary just allow yourself to come into a state of complete stillness the only observable movement now should be the breath as it makes its way through the body opening the chest and expanding the belly as you witness your body coming into stillness notice how the breath naturally slows itself you might even allow a deep sigh of relief to leave the body on an exhalation releasing any unnecessary tension or concern that lingers in your body begin to open your senses up to the world around you beginning with your ears start to become mindful of the quiet space that is around you and of any sounds that pass through this sense of stillness when opening the ears there is no need to search for noises or to label any sounds that arise simply observe whatever is going on around you through your sense of hearing [Music] [Music] [Music] become aware now of the physical space you reside in noticing the sensations of the surface beneath you of any cushions or blankets above or against you notice if there is any particular sensation of the air around you does it appear to be still or in flow is it cool warm or possibly neutral [Music] just allow your physical body and its capacity to feel the ground you deeper into this present moment [Music] [Music] I invite you now to move a little further into the body following the movement of air into your lungs tune in to the sensations of it as it enters and leaves you as the belly rises and as it falls [Music] without attempting to change the breath in any way allow it to carry you further into the experience of inner stillness even amidst its constant flow allow the physical body to settle reaching a point of complete ease and comfort if you feel is necessary to adjust your position in any way just move slowly and mindfully as you come into a place of deeper comfort [Music] take a moment now to observe the mind you might find that thoughts and associated feelings linger beneath the surface of an otherwise very still state if thoughts are present simply observe them from a place of compassion and non judgment just see if it's possible to observe them as an outsider without becoming consumed by the stories they tell and then return your attention to the breath [Music] at any point you can use the breath as a tool to draw you back into a present state of awareness when we draw our attention to the mind during meditation we might find that enchanting visuals accompany the stories we tell the point of this meditation is not to banish or look down upon this imagery that we create unconsciously meditation is simply a call to become more conscious and mindful of what is happening inside of our heads the mind is a powerful tool that can either entrap us in imagery informed by fear or that can be used to enhance our lives and create more positive beliefs ideas and dreams take a few moments now to practice being an outside observer of thoughts and imagery that appear in the mind simply become more attuned to the way that your thoughts give life to your visions knowing that you hold the power to turn your attention away from any storyline that is guided by fear worry or anxiety [Music] rather than force your thoughts to become something you might deem to be more positive take this time to let all thoughts dissolve continue to focus on the breath moving through you as you sink further and further away from mental distractions [Music] [Music] [Music] with each inhalation you might envision yourself being infiltrated with lightness peace and contentment and with each outward breath you can imagine that all negative and unconstructive thoughts and beliefs are being released allow yourself to become completely at ease within this present moment take another moment to feel into your physical body knowing that you are entirely supported in this moment physically emotionally and spiritually and that even through this simple act of slowing down you are beginning to invite more positive dreams into your evening sleep [Music] from this deep sense of underlying stillness I invite you now to use the power of your mind to enter a visual place of peace beauty and serenity there are no rules as to what this place should look like so long as it brings you a sense of inner peace the place you choose might be a beach a mountain range a lake or somewhere further afield perhaps somewhere far into outer space this is your vision take a few moments now to settle on your preferred location allowing it to enliven itself in your mind's eye [Music] [Music] commit your awareness to building this peaceful space in your mind allow it to expand naturally alongside your growing sense of inner tranquility build it using the blessing of all of your five senses tune into your sense of sight first allowing your visual sense to build this place of your truest dreams [Music] what colors and textures are present to the eyes other animals plants or other humans around you here [Music] what does the sky look like from where you look out what elements are present simply tuned into the visual presence of fire earth water and air if any or all of these are present allow your creation of this space to include your sense of sound is it completely silent where you are or are there subtle noises present possibly there's a recognizable beat or rhythm in any sounds that might be growing in this space or are the sounds disorderly like the unpredictable pitter-patter of rain [Music] simply allow that whatever brings you peace to arise in this place of beauty [Music] [Music] tuning in now to your sense of smell are there any recognizable aromas that are present here from the smell of salty water to fresh earth and autumn leaves allow nature's aromas to trickle into this imagery you are resting within and if nothing arises that is fine too there are no rules to what your mind creates so long as it brings you comfort [Music] consider your sense of taste now allowing your experience here to delight your taste buds as you explore this peaceful landscape is there anything that you feel compelled to taste you might want to indulge in wild berries in pure spring water or in some of a worldly treat born in outer space just allow your experience to be rich divine and fulfilling nourishing your entire being [Music] and as you explore this place either walking slowly through it or from a resting position allow yourself to feel into it through your physical body what nourishing surfaces does your body come into contact with [Music] how does the air feel against your skin [Music] thus the Sun or moon beam down on you filling you with a sense of ease and enchantment just allow whatever brings you deep peace to express itself here [Music] now I invite you now to tune into this place you have created with a sixth sense that is with your hearts feeling as you breathe and vision your heart expanding with each inhalation and softening with each exhalation with each breath allow your heart to open up to the piece you have just built within you let this space nourish your innermost being Oh heartedly take a few more moments to allow yourself to play rest or recharge in this beautiful and tranquil environment you have conjured use each of your senses including your heart to explore this moment as fully as possible [Music] in this very moment you feel a deep sense of care love and support granted to you by the universe by the beautiful space you have created and by your highest self and clearest mind [Music] everything in this space and time is exactly as it is meant to be and you feel highly attuned with all that is around you [Music] slowly I invite you now to gently release the imagery you have created letting go of the taste and texture and the sights and sounds [Music] gently release your vision of this beautiful place knowing that in some way on some other fjord of reality it is still very present within you [Music] even as the images fade away you maintain the heartfelt sensations this visualization opened you up to inside of you there is a deep sense of peace beauty and contentment [Music] come back now to the breath watching it flow gently and steadily through you [Music] as you return to this physical reality that you are in you begin to feel more grounded and present within your environment there is a deeper sense of that inner stillness you know is always within you so take a moment to draw your awareness through the body blessing the entirety of your physical being with deep rest and relaxation release any constriction in the belly the chest area soften and loosen the jaw release [Music] and your phorid allow the entire body to relax completely as you prepare to enter the dream world [Music] as you settle into a state very close to sleep little pieces of your peaceful paradise linger in the back of your mind unconsciously through the power of this visualization you have set the stage for beautiful dreams to carry you through the night ahead all tension worry and fear have melted away and in its place nothing but lightness and peace remains allow your breath to continue rocking you to sleep alongside each breath cycle you might silently repeat this following affirmation until slowly this awakens state drifts the way my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with beautiful visions keep your heart and mind wide open your body rooted in a sense of inner peace and harmony and allow the infinite possibilities for beauty to infiltrate your dreams continue whispering silently my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with [Music] beautiful visions until this wish becomes a slumbering reality [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this divinely inspired nighttime meditation it's a meditation designed to help you connect with three of your spirit guides and to then surrender effortlessly into sleep allow my voice to guide you through this journey opening your heart and the highest mind to the figures and messages that you are meant to encounter here so begin to soften your breath as we prepare for the otherworldly exploration before we begin I invite you to bring your body to a lying-down position that is entirely comfortable for you you may like put just your positioning with cushions and blankets warming and supporting yourself in any way you need just take a moment to gently scan the body releasing any constrictions you might come across perhaps in the belly the shoulders your neck or your furrowed softly invite the entire body to relax its posture as you open the chest gently take a few deep breaths here to settle into this position [Music] [Music] [Music] now draw your awareness to the physical body by tuning into your sense of touch without moving become more highly aware of the physical world that holds you notice the sensations present beneath your body at every inch of skin that is in contact with the surface below you [Music] expand your awareness by noting other physical sensations such as the way clothing or blankets feel against your body all the way the air around you touches your skin [Music] without judgment and without searching for anything simply practice opening your awareness to whatever the present state of your reality is draw your awareness deeper now tapping into a more visceral awareness of the physical body is it possible to observe any sensations or movements of energy within the cellular body can you sense the energetic body draw your awareness to your breath and begin to notice the way the outside world enters your inner world by the way of this life force observe any sensations that are present as you inhale and exhale notice if perhaps this awareness begins to dissolve the gap between the outer and inner world bringing you closer to a sense of harmony and balance feel yourself becoming more deeply connected to everything around you as you continue to breathe [Music] [Music] now tune in once again to the surface beneath you and imagine for a moment that there are sturdy roots beginning to grow from all the places that make contact with the earth feel these roots expanding permeating the surface beneath you and then slowly breaking through the rich dense soil beneath the earth's surface [Music] as you ground yourself into the physical world this way observe yourself being nourished by the nutrients and lifeforce that rise through these roots see if you can feel these roots feeding you supporting you and protecting you as you begin to feel more and more grounded in the space you are in gently allow this visual to dissolve knowing that the earth still supports you even without your attention held on it shift your attention now by drawing your awareness to the crown of your head feel into the lightness that is present here noticing perhaps a white or golden glow occupying the space where your mind and physical body meets the universe [Music] open your awareness to the invisible universal energies that permeate your being through your crown perhaps visualizing this descending energy as a golden thread as it enters your body this divine energy makes its way to every corner of your inner world inspiring and enlightening all aspects of your being rest in silence for a moment to observe this healing energy and lighten and inspire your entire being between the earthly energies and the cosmic ones you are now coming to witness your being as both human and divine both grounded and expansive just take one moment to observe this intermingling of the earthly in spiritual realms and then allow all visuals of this healing energy to disappear leaving behind a sense of deep connection to everything that exists around you [Music] awareness of the spiritual realm has now been unlocked you are open and nearly prepared for the journey you will soon make towards your spirit guides as we proceed with this movement into the spirit world I invite you to remember that you are always in control of this journey if at any point you feel uncomfortable or simply wishing to take your newfound knowledge back to your body you're always welcome to come back to the physical world by returning to your breath your breath is always available to anchor you to the present moment and will help guide you into a deep and restful sleep please know that you are entirely supported on this journey that the universe is offering unconditional love and support to you in this very moment just take a moment now to feel into this Universal energy by returning to your breath for a few moments of silence as you inhale feel your body and spirit being nourished with healing waves of energy and as you exhale feel yourself being cleared of all stagnant energy all fear all negativity and all that holds you back from your truest self open your heart to trust to healing and to awakening if thoughts arise at any point simply observe their presence and then gently release them as you come back to your breath and your awareness of the spirit world the crown has been opened and you are now prepared to meet with your spirit guides so let us slowly ascend to their realm with eyes remaining closed draw your awareness to the space between your brows this energetic region of the body often referred to as the third eye hold your capacity for higher perception it is the center of your intuition insight and wisdom just hold your attention here for just a moment and then slowly begin to envision a mystical and enchanted forest appearing within this space [Music] [Music] continue to breathe deeply as you visualized the trees shrubs vines and flowers begin to grow here expand your awareness to observe the insects that circulate through soil and air and the animals that call this place home allow this place to penetrate your soul enveloping you with a sense of peace and comfort and joy you to feel at home in this space so take your time to explore whatever is here [Music] out of the dense forest ahead of you you notice a pathway beginning to clear as if beckoning you to move deeper into the woods you feel safe and secure venturing that way so you begin to tread mindfully down the path notice the way the earth feels beneath your feet and the way the forest air feel was your lungs just ahead of you along the path you notice a bright white figure beginning to appear it is somewhat like a human form but is radiating in otherworldly energy [Music] deep in your bones you know that this is your first spirit guide you continue to move towards this spirits direction feeling drawn to whatever messages you are now sensing our present here take your time to observe this figure as you approach what energy does he or she exude what might he or she have to share [Music] finally you reach your spirit guide standing just before him or her you gaze into one another's eyes and through them your guide speaks listen closely to what is offered here without searching for anything simply open yourself to the teachings that are being offered open your heart as divine messages filter into your soul [Music] [Music] your guide extends his or her hand to you and you reach for it you sense there is another figure this spirit would like you to meet and so together you move further into the woods as you walk you are infused with your spirits energy becoming more empowered and inspired with each step that you take together see if you can feel all of your cells coming to life awakening to the truths that are being offered to you [Music] and once again you notice another beaming figure of light just ahead of you on this path take your time as you slowly move your way towards it observing whatever energies or characteristics are noticeable as you approach [Music] as you look into the eyes of this second spirit guide you feel a great sense of peace and calm come over you this spirit like the first speaks at a higher frequency than the earthly realm is accustomed to blessing you with this new inside take a few moments to rest with this spirit allowing the messages he or she offers to permeate your entire being [Music] now with each of these mystical spirits on either side of you you know that there is one final guide you are meant to meet on this journey the three of you continue walking slowly and mindfully through the dense and enchanted woods that surround you continue to breathe in the fresh forest air allowing it to reach all the way to the depths of your belly tune in once again to the textures and colors of the woods mindfully observing all the mystical creatures and plants that bring everlasting life to this place [Music] finally in the clearing ahead of you you see the third and final figure of light the spirit is glowing with arms stretched forward warmly you make your way towards this spirit feeling instantly renewed awakened and welcomed and as you finally meet this divine body of energy you reach your hands forward to meet theirs as you look into this third spirits eyes you are instantly filled with light peace love and clarity take a few moments to bathe in this experience allowing the highest message to come to you open your heart to whatever it is you need to hear right here right now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in this clearing within the woods you and your three spirit guides come to form a circle hand in hand take a moment to look towards the first who came to you sinking more deeply into the message he or she had offered you [Music] [Music] now shift your gaze to the second spirit you met remembering the bits of insights that were infused into your being upon your encounter [Music] and finally gaze into the eyes of the third and final spirit opening your heart to whatever was presented to you allow this final message to mingle for a few moments with your entire being [Music] take a moment to thank each of your spirit guides and then gently allow them to dissipate back into the air of these enchanted woods know that they have not left you but they are always always within [Music] gently allow the entire forest to melt away as you draw your awareness back to your physical body [Music] notice once again the feeling of the bed or other support system beneath you and then reconnect with your breath to help ground you back into this physical reality nestled into the cushions and blankets that are there around you allowing them to bring warmth to body and spirit [Music] the messages that were offered may continue to linger for a short time but soon I invite you to surrender them back to the universe for the night knowing that they are never very far away let all thoughts go as you come back down to this very moment in time there is nothing you need to witness in this moment aside from your body as it slowly surrenders into sleep the positive and powerful insights you have encountered will return tomorrow but for now allow the body heart mind and solve the risk deeply into the physical world with your spirit guides always around you you can rest with ease knowing that you are supported unconditionally throughout this lifetime allow the following affirmation to lull you to sleep repeating these words silently and softly as you inch closer and closer towards a restorative slumber the universe supports me the universe supports me the universe supports me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and thank you for tuning into this meditation this meditation comes at a time an exceptionally challenging time for us here in Australia as the wildfires have sparked overwhelming devastation fear uncertainty grief and despair with a situation as destructive as this one right before our very eyes it's hard to find a sense of peace safety and security in the earth beneath our feet even those who have seen the images footages and news from afar can sense a great loss that is occurring in this beautiful country humans pets plants animals property nothing is beyond the reach of these fires so wherever you are in the world I hope this meditation brings some sense of peace comfort as we move forward to get started I invite you to take a moment just to settle into this space either lying down or in a comfortable seated position and allow your belly to relax and the forit to soften as you simply arrive wherever you are my hopes are that you are far from danger in this moment and then you can find some sense of solidity in the earth beneath you right now so draw your attention to the breath and watching it as it flows into and out of your body [Music] and then see if you might invite the breath a little bit deeper relaxing your stomach as you welcome both body and mind to soften here [Music] now take a few moments to be mindful of any thoughts or any feelings any stories that are moving through your mind in this moment if you've been touched by fires in some way in Australia or any part of the world take a moment to honor whatever feelings and sensations are present for you and if you are somewhere else across the ocean and have been shaken by what you've seen in the media or heard from loved ones take a moment to also honor whatever has arisen within this meditation is not designed to make everything okay it is first meant to assist us in honoring the raw truth of our experience before guiding us into some sense of peace despite this tragic event now finish your next exhalation and then take a deep breath in and out a deep breath in once again and out and one more time while it's important to witness and honor whatever is within us we can continually bring ourselves back to the peace and safety of this present moment through awareness of the breath use the breath as your anchor anytime you need to reconnect with what is right here the fear and uncertainty of approaching fires the loss of homes of wildlife and animals a sense of hopelessness helplessness and disempowerment and the grief the anger the shock the desperation all of these are very real experiences that a meditation cannot make right in any tangible sense the very raw and heart-wrenching feelings that have been stirred are so deeply human the devastation is hard to put into words [Music] and so because of what is happening here and in other areas of the world we might feel as if someone or something is to blame now whether that be climate change politicians or humanity as a whole being able to point out a cause for this devastation can in some way feel consoling and yet anger blame and rage will not help us to find peace healing and a way for us to move forward and when we dig deeper we might tap into what is beneath our anger is there a sense of fear juda feeling unsupported unprotected or vulnerable is there a sense of despair for the suffering of animals wildlife and humanity [Music] whatever is moving through you I invite you to tune in to what is present in the body and can you observe and sit with these emotions as they manifest themselves in your physical being [Music] you might want to breathe energy into these areas of tightness tension or resistance naturally letting yourself soften into this meditation [Music] grounding through the breath little thoughts and stories come as they may and and watch them depart just as effortlessly with each out breath this might take some time so just practice compassion as these things work themselves through [Music] to explore this soft and compassionate witnessing I invite you to create a bit of distance between your thoughts and feelings and yourself as the observer of them see if you might approach your fears and concerns from a place of your highest itself as you watch what moves through consider can i nurture this part of me this part of the world that is suffering [Music] [Music] open your heart to yourself holding yourself exactly as you are in this moment and as we open up through this center of our being we can begin to find a greater sense of peace even amidst the heaviness that life can bring [Music] continue to breathe all the way into the base of the belly and all the way back out releasing just a fraction of discomfort resistance and any strong emotions with each and every breath [Music] now begin to imagine a white healing light penetrating from the top of your head inching ever so slowly down through the body with every body part that it passes feel your body gently opening up to a deeper release in a sense of bees [Music] allow the mind to soften beneath its glow your heart to expand and your belly to relax and your limbs to find softness and stillness while there may be residue of emotion and fear see if you can open yourself up to this moment of peace stillness and subtle healing can you allow yourself to be bathed in this white healing glow but these next few moments and now from this lighter softer space see if you might open your heart as you bring to mind the land the humans and the animals that are in need of your love and your prayers at this time you might envision strangers or perhaps someone you know and love you might envision farmland forests plants and animals or rows of homes you might envision the whole country or the whole world [Music] regardless of what comes to mind allow the images of these Souls to enter your mind from a place of love rather than fear hold the image of them in both mind and heart and sending love light and peace to all those affected [Music] as we allow our strongest emotions to come to pass and to soften opening up to our reality from a place of purpose and love we start to uncover ways we might be of benefit to ourselves to our loved ones our community and our shared humanity from sending prayers to sending support and supplies to helping in hands-on ways where possible let these devastating fires bring our shared humanity to the forefront encouraging us to love support and send peace to all those on this planet take a few moments of quiet space now to send prayers or loving thoughts to all those affected by these fires and to those affected by any other disaster that is shaking this world and those who call it home [Music] [Music] gently soften your mind of all thoughts or prayers and all best wishes as you come back to the natural rhythm of the breath allow each inhalation to open your heart to the love and healing that is possible and each exhalation free you of things that no longer serve you so that you may move through this world with hope and purpose and love whatever comes your way I send you my prayers and warmest of wishes allow the waves of life to move through you but to never hold you down for too long beneath the destruction and devastation there is hope for a new world of peace and love and beauty take your time to come out of this meditation trusting the process that leads you to renewed faith hope and healing and I send you many many blessings to you and your loved ones [Music] [Music]

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided nighttime meditation that is aimed to help you wind down both body and mind before sleep often times we get into bed with our heart set on getting a great night's sleep an overactive body or mind or both stand in the way of our achieving this deep relaxation that we yearned for so to address this challenge this meditation will help you to soften all of that interactivity and tension as you find yourself drifting naturally and gracefully into a sound sleep so before we begin I invite you to take a moment or two to ensure that all of your end-of-day activities are taken care of lights turned off alarms set if needed and anything else that might stand in the way of your fullest relaxation you can address this [Music] and once everything is taken care of just getting comfortable in your sleeping or lying down position your neck should be aligned with the spine and your arms and legs are free to fall and rest where they may and take a deep breath in now and out and allowing yourself to surrender a little bit into the surface beneath you take a moment here to simply acknowledge the present state of your mind [Music] without judging or evaluating or trying to change anything see if you might observe whatever thoughts or feelings are present from a place of subtle separation [Music] it doesn't need to be any attachment to whatever you were witnessing just a soft and compassionate acknowledgement of your present state of being [Music] now softly surrender is focused awareness as you shift your attention to the natural rhythm of your breath [Music] see if you can follow each inhalation and exhalation and mindfully observing whatever sensations are present you might notice the depth of your breath and its speed or rhythm [Music] but in any case see if you can accept your current state of being without trying to change it in any way [Music] and as you observe your breath you might notice it beginning to deepen and quite often when we draw our attention in a loving and non-judgmental way to the breath it begins to expand on its own you might observe the belly softening or the shoulders falling whatever your experience feels like is entirely welcome [Music] whether we are consciously aware of it or not our body and mind is connected so when there is tension in either body or mind it often impacts the well-being of the other aspect of ourselves sometimes we're not entirely aware of the tension we hold on to until we start to consciously release it so what we are going to do is we're going to move through a gentle though powerful practice of tension and release as you hear each body part mentioned I invite you to bring attention or tightness to this region and then to release it completely on your following breath out so to begin draw your attention down to your feet on your next in-breath curling them in and holding them tightly for a brief moment and on your next exhalation release this tension completely [Music] breathe slowly and mindfully in between body parts noticing the wave of relaxation that pervades the mind as we move through this practice now bring a tightness to both legs pulling them in and holding them just for a moment and release them on the exhalation perhaps relaxing more thoroughly through a deep sigh [Music] on your next breath in contract the space within your pelvis region and your backside holding for just a brief moment and then soften these areas on your exhalation and melting further into the surface that support you [Music] shifting your focus now up to your belly tightening your core muscles on your next inhalation Titan and as you exhale allow all the muscles here to relax completely feel a complete surrender in your core taking a few slow deep breaths into your belly now [Music] draw your attention now to your hands tightening them into fists on your next inhalation tighten and as you exhale allow your fingers and palms to soften completely [Music] on your next inhalation pull your arms into your sides squeezing and holding for just a moment and as you exhale allow them to surrender completely to gravity [Music] bring a subtle and inward pull to your shoulders and upper chest area on your next inhalation and tighten and relax these areas completely allowing the shoulders to fall back and the hard area to soften and expand [Music] now I invite you to focus on the muscles in your face tightening your jaw your cheeks your forehead but just a moment really tense really tighten and as you exhale allow all face muscles to soften completely let go [Music] lastly I invite you to tense your entire body or any particular region that you feel requires further release and hold here for just a moment as you observe the sensation of tension here on your next outward breath let the entire physical body go letting gravity nourish you as it holds you safely and comfortably on the bed or other service that supports you here [Music] just take a few moments of silence here to ground yourself through the breath once again subtly observing the underlying restful state of both body and mind [Music] [Music] [Music] if it feels more comfortable to sink into sleep in a different position you're welcome to shift your posture at any time and if or as you move positions just move slowly and mindfully embodying this peaceful state of being that you have transitioned into [Music] if any thoughts arise in the forefront of your mind attempting to pull you away from this inner peace continue observing these invisible movements of energy by silently whispering to yourself I see you and I release you I see you and I release you I see you and I release you [Music] [Music] [Music] now allowing all thoughts to be gently surrendered as they arise see if he can tune into the blank canvas that exists before the mind's eye and in this space begin to visualize yourself standing at the edge of a majestic lake the ancient pines that surround the shore the clouds that fill the sky and the subtle stars that begin to appear overhead as the night approaches [Music] each of these elements adds to the wonder of this space you are witnessing [Music] the waters are calm and clear mirroring the pink orange and fading blue sky above [Music] you feel equally peaceful silently whispering the beauty and radiance of this simple moment [Music] you stand firmly grounded on a rocky peninsula that slopes gently towards the water barefoot you feel into the cool rock beneath you kneeling deeply connected to and supported by the physical earth this connection you now hold with nature inspires you to seek more of this natural comfort in your waking life to return to this natural place whenever you seek clarity peace or release just to your right a narrow dark extends from the shore at the end of it a floating raft gently bobbles atop the still water [Music] as the Sun sets we begin to feel tired hoping to drift off beneath the stars that grow brighter and brighter as the sky darkens so you begin to slowly and mindfully make your way down the dock soon coming to reach the raft that floats at the end of it [Music] upon reaching the raft you notice that there are already cushions and blankets set up for you making yourself comfortable you come to rest here lying down gently beneath the stars overhead a gentle lapping of water beneath the raft lulls you closer and closer toward sleep [Music] as you listen to it the mind begins to fall away and your inner peace rises to the surface [Music] before drifting off however you take one long last look up towards the cosmos witnessing the stars here surrounded by the beauty and peace of this natural landscape it is enough to melt all worries and fears away [Music] all tensions are released from both body and mind as you develop a deep trust in the grander vision of life the Stars offer you this heightened perspective [Music] you close your eyes on even the stars now tuning into the sound and sensations observed here the water continues to lap beneath the raft and the subtle rocking makes you feel deeply connected to the water beneath you to the flow of life itself and to this unique and wonderful journey you are honored [Music] [Music] you return to your breath now witnessing the natural ebb and flow of this life force as it passes through your physical being [Music] on your next in breath just allow the heart and belly to expand completely and as you breathe out release any last traces of tension perhaps with a deep sigh to help you settle [Music] now gently allow the notion of this majestic lake to dissipate as you tune into your physical presence wherever you are notice the comfort and support of the surface beneath you the nourishment of the breath as it flows through you and the piece that is observable beneath the layers of your mind [Music] [Music] with nothing left to envision and nothing left to do you are ready to let the day come to an end so that another may arrive when you were well-rested letting everything go gently allow yourself to drift into a deep and steady slumber as you fall to sleep allow the following affirmations to fill your subconscious mind continuing to transform the inner world in positive and empowering ways [Music] I am safe grounded and secure [Music] I am body.you deep in a piece [Music] when tension arises I let it go with grace [Music] I inhale nourishment and exhale what does not serve me [Music] I trust the ever unfolding nature of life I know when to act and when to rest [Music] I witness and release any thoughts based in fear [Music] [Music] I am patient and peaceful [Music] [Music] I am open to new empowering possibilities [Music] I am worthy

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this soothing guided meditation that will take you on a journey into the peace of the ocean gently guiding you towards a restorative and peaceful sleep during the course of this journey you will first come into contact with the peace that exists right here in the present moment before being guided to open yourself up to a deeper descent underwater all that is required of you now is a willingness to open yourself up to the possibility of complete inner harmony take a few grounding breaths now as we begin this exploration allowing your heart and chest to soften with each breath that you take [Music] now take a few moments to make any necessary adjustments to the physical body moving yourself in such a way to allow relaxation to flow effortlessly through your being if there is any tightness lingering around the chest or the stomach or your shoulders or any other part of your body quietly make note of this tension and then gently release it on the next breath out [Music] straighten your neck soften the area around your eyes as you consciously begin to release all physical tension you prepare yourself for the journey into deep release and peace [Music] now before we journey anywhere let's take some time to become more intimately aware of the environment around and within us begin by simply drawing your awareness to the physical body and each area of it that is in contact with the physical support beneath you you might notice the entire back side of your body being completely supported by the bed or the cushions or the blankets underneath you just take a moment to simply draw your attention to each area of contact here now consider areas of the body facing upwards towards the ceiling that are also in contact with the material world noticing items of comfort that might be draped over the top of you and then see if you can finally tuned in to the invisibility of air that surrounds your body noticing if you can feel it against your skin in these observations there is no need to search for some specific form of experience or result simply allow any arisings to be witnessed [Music] draw your attention now to the belly as you observe the way it rises and falls as you inhale and exhale [Music] even if sensations of the breath within a more subtle we can typically observe their presence in the form of movement once we draw our attention to this life force so allow the rest of the body to remain still as you focus for a few silent moments on the rising and falling of your core use your breath as an anchor when needed throughout this meditation even when you descend into the depths of the ocean in this visualization the breath is always available to provide you with grounding support and connection to this physical existence and if at any point the mind wanders becoming preoccupied with stories fears or judgments or chatter of any sort you can once again turn to the breath or to my words to refocus your attention it's entirely natural for our minds to wander so there is no need to condemn this tendency in any way when distractions occur simply take a deep breath refocus your attention and settle into this act of self-care once again as you watched the breath moving into and out of your body allow a sense of tranquility to overcome your entire being of seemingly paradoxical the breath is both like an anchor and like the waves they are one in the same as we learn to ride the waves of breath and of life we move towards the discovery of complete presence and stillness no matter how still we bring ourselves to be waves will still come just as the breath will still come movement is a part of life how we react to those movements is where we discover our power to maneuver ourselves in this world peacefully and calmly so before we descend into the ocean take a few moments of silence to effortlessly move with the rhythm of your breath the body will remain still while the present moment continually shifts sink into this peaceful movement for a short while now [Music] take this moment to tune into the space between the brows into the Mayans I allow all thoughts and images to melt away as you focus your attention solely on the empty space before you the world around and within becomes quiet as you prepare for a journey into the depths of the ocean upon this blank slate before your mind's eye begin to visualize yourself at the edge of the ocean your bare feet are nestled into the sand as you stare out the vast sea before you take a few moments to observe the sensations present what do your eyes notice you what sounds to your ears pickup what smells fill the air how does your body feel how does your heart feel as you begin to relax into this space eel the ocean air filling the entire cavity of your lungs as you inhale and then releasing all unnecessary stress and tension from your physical body as you exhale stare out at the open sea as you witness every knot and contraction dissolving [Music] you take a few steps forward so that as the waves brush up against the shore they cover your feet observe the natural rhythm of the waves steady though ever-changing just like the breath they continue to flow in and out in and out the ocean slowly becomes influenced by your breaths natural rhythm slowly coming to meet your own unique flow you start to feel yourself to be in total harmony with the vast abyss in front of you something inside of you whispers view to venture into the water so you start to move slowly and gracefully forward step by step you wade out until soon your calves are submerged and then your knees your thighs and your waist you stand waist-deep as you prepare to dive below [Music] stretching your arms out before you you take a deep breath a small jump and then dive forward with grace and these you are now completely submerged as you glide through the water extending both arm fords and then swooping them out to the sides to propel you further you notice that by divine magic you are able to breathe beneath the water small gills have developed and you come to realize that you are neither of this world nor the human one you are otherworldly a great wave of relief washes over you as you realize you had been yearning to explore this underwater palace with ease you continue to breast to stroke your way through the ocean feeling completely safe and accepted within this new kingdom [Music] you absorb every new side every color texture and shape of the sea life you pass [Music] seahorses brightly striped fish and even small shark swim around you none of them posing any threat to you in this magical environment you breathe naturally and effortlessly underwater your body feels light and free completely supported with each and every movement you make with every drop of water that soon passes over your body old stories and detachments are released soon nothing remains but a sense of oneness you are aligned with the oceans movements gliding with grace now something appears to be approaching you from straight ahead though you cannot make out what the creature is your intuition tells you it is not threatening the pair of eyes move closer and closer until very soon you know the figure to be a dolphin that is making its way toward you the dolphin slows as she approaches stilling herself just a few feet ahead of you you too have ceased movement now floating effortlessly in the open abyss of the great sea both pairs of eyes meet as you take a few silent moments of pure awareness here you can sense that your energies are in harmony and that you have attracted one another for a reason [Music] though the dolphin speaks a different language in sound the vibrations relay her message she reminds you that it is possible to be both compassionate and gentle while harnessing a deep and authentic source of inner strength when embodying these two principles the way dolphins do body and mind relax completely knowing that the paradoxes in life do not have to bring strife strength and compassion can co-exist they can be one in the same the dolphin breaks her gaze as she swims off to the side and begins to swim playful circles around you she sings out to the sea reminding you that it is okay to lighten up to play and to be who you really are as she sings you feel her vibrations radiating into the core of your being in this moment you know you are forever changed for the better balance and harmony have now made their way into your burns rather than remaining an idea digested by mind alone [Music] the dolphin slows and comes back for one more brief moment to gaze into your eyes a subtle smile overcomes her face before she flutters away disappearing into the darkness ahead of you you breathe deeply feeling her still very much present within you [Music] she has blessed you with a wisdom and the gifts gifts that now live within you you look above and notice you are not too far from the surface of the ocean the sunlight trickles in to remind you to come back to the human world though you have enjoyed your time in the depths of the ocean you know you must now return as you swim slowly and calmly up towards the light you feel every last grain of tension fall from your body sinking down to the ocean floor to be renewed you feel light and free having no remaining weightiness in your body or mind as you break through the barrier of water that opens up to the open sky your gills disappear and you notice what it is like to breathe like a human once again floating on your back you take a few deep breaths into the belly feeling a sense of calm filling you completely [Music] visuals of the ocean begin to disappear from your mind's eye as you tune in once again to the support and strength of the physical world beneath your body though the ocean and a dolphin are now behind you they are forever within your heart and spirit allow this earthly world to support you once again the feeling of peace freedom and calmness that the underwater world blessed you are still within you you will carry them into sleep as you surrender effortlessly into the coming slumber [Music] follow your breath acknowledging it to be both wave and anchor as you melt into this present moment completely welcoming another restorative night's sleep there is nothing left to do but to grant your body in mind permission to release themselves for another night follow your breath now in silence allowing it to guide you into a deep and peaceful sleep [Music] welcome to this guided meditation which is designed to help you slow your racing mind and then lead you gently into a soothing and restorative sleep over the next little while I invite you to simply follow my voice as you come to experience a profound sense of silence within take a few deep breaths now to settle yourself into this space and soon and we will begin it is not uncommon within our fast-paced modern lifestyle for the mine to be on constant overdrive even when we bring the body to rest mental chatter often persists one of the primary reasons that we have trouble easing our way into sleep is because of this feverish side of the mind whether it is caught up in the past events or is living 20 steps into the future the mind has a way of pulling us out of the present moment it keeps us stimulated and engaged even when we want to try to slow down when the mind is constantly on the go deep rest is put on hold before we begin navigating this side of the mind exposing it in such a way that calms and soothes it let us take a few moments to come into a comfortable lying down position and just taking your time to stretch and release the body in any way that feels restorative and to adjust your positioning with cushions or blankets as you require and once you are settled see if it is possible to straighten the neck if it is curved at all bringing a gentle oneness across the chest breathing in and exhaling [Music] grounding yourself into the physical space beneath and around you so take some time now to really connect with your breath becoming intimate with the way it passes through you as you inhale observe every sensation as the air trickles in first entering your nasal cavity passing through the trachea and then settling into the depths of your lungs and as you breathe out observe the moment in Reverse as your breath returns to the world around you notice your breaths rhythm and depth [Music] without changing it in any way for the time being simply observe its flow noticing where it extends to and how fast or slow it moves as we move through this meditation remember that your breath is always available to help anchor you in this present moment if distracting thoughts arise which they will allow the breath to guide you back down to your body to your direct experience of the now [Music] take a moment now to simply draw your attention to your stomach notice the way the belly moves as you breathe rising and falling throughout the cycle of your breath as you draw your attention to this area of the body you might notice that the breath naturally deepens if so open yourself to this consciously release any constriction in the abdomen to help guide the flow of air deep into the belly [Music] when how Mayans run uncontrollably our bodies assume a state of stress engaging a defense mechanism known as the fight-or-flight response when the body is engaged in this way the breath loses its depth hovering in the more shallow cavities of the lungs hormone surge as the body prepares to defend itself in order to counterbalance this surge of stress hormones and to soften the reaction within the body we can engage in what is known as the relaxation response to help the body and mind to slow down by consciously drawing the breath into the belly we invite this counter response to take over easing the racing thoughts that stimulate the physical body take a few moments of silence now to deepen the breath in this way guiding it into the fullest capacity of the lungs so that it presses into the abdomen if you find it challenging at first to deepen your breath all the way this is entirely okay over time the breath will soften and the lungs will expand for now just see how far the breath is capable of going as you slowly breathe in and slowly breathe out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thoughts may continue to rise from time to time but there is no need to panic or self judge if they do the mind may attempt to add fuel to the fire by criticizing telling the self that it should not be thinking refrain from giving in to this common reaction reminding yourself that is natural for thoughts to arise and then compassionately releasing whatever has come up [Music] [Music] thinking is a natural function of the mind and as such it cannot be forced to cease entirely however we can begin to expose our racing thoughts by observing them from a new place and with the fresh lens as we uncover their nature we begin to distance ourselves from them and from the stories that they spin so now I invite you to open your heart to the truth that you are not your thoughts take a few breaths here on your own repeating the following words in silence I am NOT my thoughts I am NOT my thoughts allow yourself to open wholeheartedly to the truth that your thoughts do not define you [Music] [Music] notice the way that the mind can be redirected in such a way flowing alongside your attention it can take time to catch the mind when it escapes but we continued practice it is possible to refocus again and again on the direct experience within this present moment any time the mind wanders simply acknowledge its movement with compassion and curiosity there is no reason to criticize or condemn the uprising of thought instead practice observing the inner dialog from a distance when you notice yourself becoming entangled in the minds story simply notice what has happened and draw your attention back to your breath [Music] continue to follow each inhale and each exhale as you continually re-establish yourself in the present moment [Music] [Music] it is possible to further de-escalate the power of your thoughts by beginning to label them whenever they arise this sort of labeling should not be based in judgment such as being defined by words such as good or bad or spiritual or an spiritual rather rising thoughts can be observed according to the action that they represent for instance you may assign certain words to your thoughts such as thinking planning denying criticizing or worrying after you label thoughts in this way allow the wave to disappear and then return to your breath [Music] practice this again rooting yourself through the breath and becoming more aware of the nature of your thoughts not of their content witness the way they move and the nature of these movements [Music] [Music] other actions you might notice include hoping feeling dreaming and arguing continue to quietly observe whatever arises coming back to your breath in between rising thoughts [Music] you you you might also observe physical sensations labeling them as pressure softness tingling or warmth continue to notice whatever you notice allowing single words to disengage and trancing stories [Music] [Music] [Music] continue to come back to the natural rhythm of your breath in between observations breathing in breathing out continually refocusing your attention on this innate flow now let whole words and thoughts subside as you come deeper into the physical sensations of the body take a moment to scan the body gently drawing your awareness first your toes before very slowly moving upwards throughout the visceral body and as you pass each area allow that part of the body to soften by simply focusing on a particular area and by using the power of your attention to release all of the associated muscles the physical body relaxes and the mind relaxes even further alongside it [Music] continue to work your way up slowly releasing or constriction and tension that is held within the body breathe into each body part blessing your physical being with love and compassion [Music] when you reach the head area pay special attention to the jaw to the eyebrows and to the forehead allow each of these muscle groups to relax observing the difference between felt contraction and release now draw your attention now to the space between your brows to what is often referred to as the third eye area and as you hold your attention on this spot consciously keep the muscles around it relaxed and breathe into this space for just a few breaths noticing any sensations or visuals that might be present now gently envision a light blue glow beginning to appear in this space it is soft and soothing gently pulsating in this space between your eyebrows and as it expands it touches every cell of the mind space dissolving all thoughts as it pulses [Music] you might notice yourself beginning to feel quiet tired finally feeling free of your thought waves and feeling ready to relax deeply you might also like to feel into this release through a deep sigh exhaling all tension out of the body until nothing remains in your attention aside from this healing blue light [Music] once all thoughts have been dissolved this orb of energy begins to shrink but not disappearing entirely now this soft blue glow appears as a pearl pristine clear and sparkling it hovers in the space between the brows for another moment and you come to witness a deep and profound silence within its presence sit with this silence for a few moments observing the peace and tranquility this pearl of light has brought to your inner being [Music] [Music] the soft Paul begins to descend moving very slowly until it reaches the throat and then floating a little further still until it lands in the heart it pauses here bringing its energy of stillness and tranquility to the heart space all is silent now or has been brought to peace [Music] [Music] the work of this blue light is now complete and so very slowly it dissipates into nothingness you feel complete serenity in this very moment knowing that you have been freed of all racing thoughts the mind is at peace the heart is at peace and your body is at peace [Music] continue to breathe as you begin your final descent into sleep allow the natural rhythm of your breath the slow and steady waves of each cycle to gently guide you into restorative slumber the world within you and around you is quiet any subtle sounds begin to fade away as you slowly transition into a deep and peaceful sleep inhale and exhale slowly deeply until very soon this waking day has faded away [Music] [Music] welcome to this guided morning meditation as you slowly awaken this morning this meditation will gently guide you into a natural embrace of the day ahead before we begin I invite you to come into a comfortable position whether that sitting or lying down ensure that the spine is straight your shoulders are relaxed and the neck should be aligned with the spine all muscles gently relaxed so just take a moment to adjust yourself in any way necessary just to ensure you are comfortable and supported and when you are ready allowing your eyes to gently close to begin this meditation simply come to notice your breath without trying to change it without judgment or assessment and you simply notice the nature of it witness the way it effortlessly moves into the body and then back out [Music] just become attuned to the natural flow of the breath as though observing the breath the full length of each breath in and out [Music] [Music] as you begin to settle take a moment to witness the entirety of your body and mind our thoughts often when we wake we carry fragments of our dreams and we hold on to thoughts about the days behind and the days ahead of us so simply begin to observe from a place of non-attachment but ever you may be carrying in the physical body [Music] just gently witnessing any areas of tension or discomfort and invite your breath to nurture these areas take a few deep breaths into each area of the body calling for your attention and then gently release them [Music] allow your body to sink for a moment into complete stillness and silence [Music] [Music] [Music] in the same way now draw your attention to anything arising in the mind now there is no need to search for anything simply observe yourself open up to the thoughts that may be pre-existing or as they make themselves known just witness the nature of them and in the same way release them knowing that they are simply intangible ideas about what has come or what may be to come as you do this naturally notice yourself sinking further into this present moment sinking deeply into this waking day [Music] [Music] whatever ideas you have about the day ahead I invite you to set them aside a short while as you explore the moment you are presently in just notice through the physical body the surface that support you the chair you are seated on or the mattress you are lying on might be the floor quietly observe any sounds or physical sensations around you both strong or subtle [Music] and through your closed eyes notice if there's any sense of sunlight trickling in or shadows dancing behind your closed eyes [Music] as you come to mindfully explore the world around you there is silence and stillness begin to make note of the presence of day just continue to allow the breath to guide you through this gentle awakening of the senses noticing how you are inextricably linked through the breath to the world outside of you allow each in-breath to nourish you and each breath out to free you of any constriction fatigue or even thoughts that may be lingering [Music] allow yourself to be nourished through the breath as you open your heart to this new day [Music] I invite you now to draw your awareness to your belly and as you do watch the way the breath flows in through your chest filling the entirety of your lungs and causes the stomach to expand to rise and you might witness an expansion of the chest area as well an opening up of the heart space [Music] [Music] if the mind wanders continue to simply invited back down and into the physical body the day ahead will wait for now simply embrace and enjoy these quiet moments of stillness presence and awareness allowing yourself to tune into the energy of a gentle a natural expansion that comes with sunrise [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now from this place of complete awareness and presence begin to tune into the heart space drawing your awareness to the center of the chest and allow your heart to expand that has it expands envision it touching all possibilities for the day ahead you might envision a white or a golden light radiating out from the heart making contact with the future that is continually unfolding if you find any anxious or fearful thoughts arise just witness them without becoming attached to them and gently focus back into your heart space or into the golden light radiating from this space within you [Music] focusing now on your highest potential and visions for the day it might be goals that you want to achieve things that you want to set out to do all you need to do and allow any cluttering or limiting thoughts to naturally fall away and there is no need to force anything out of existence or to judge or condemn anything that might be arising if anything less than your highest potential arises simply notice it acknowledge it and allow it to dissipate whatever we envision on a regular basis we start to manifest in the outer world consciously reflect for a moment on whatever it is your highest self wishes to manifest in your life or more specifically in the day ahead what is the deepest yearning of your heart [Music] what is the energy you wish to carry with you throughout your day continuing to feel into the hearts glow and compassionately allowing conflicting mental chatter to subside as a higher truth reveals itself begin to narrow in on what is it you wish to manifest considering for a moment that you already hold whatever it is you may take a few moments to breathe into this feeling as if it is already present within you allow your thoughts to be clear and conscious stemming from the core of who you are you might like to consider in the words of Rumi what you seek is seeking you [Music] just allow the openness of your heart to hold the truth that whatever you hope to embody is already here it is already present within you [Music] [Music] just coming back to the body now and taking in a few more grounding breaths before setting a powerful intention for the day ahead allow yourself to be completely here knowing that in truth there is no where you need to go and nothing you need to achieve as we increase our ability to be fully present you might find limiting thoughts begin to fall away and you begin to embody more deeply the truth of who you are take three silent and steady breaths here routing yourself in the expanding energy of this morning you so from this place of pure presence I invite you now to set one more clear and powerful intention for your day consider whatever it is you wish to embody and state it to yourself as if it were already here for instance if you are longing is for self confidence and esteem consider a phrase such as I am confident and complete or if the stability and safety are of your highest concern perhaps an affirmation like all of my deepest needs are being met just allow yourself to become very clear and focused on your intention as you begin to repeat it to yourself with each full breath so take a few moments of silence here as you align your intention with your breath letting the words fill you up entirely again and again but just a few moments [Music] [Music] so wherever you are now resting come to notice once again with eyes closed environment around you feel into the physical support of the ground beneath you of the material world it has been manifested around you [Music] see if you can notice the air of the room that you are currently in and he sounds near or far [Music] and take three more full breaths here knowing that you are unconditionally supported in this journey gently begin to soften the area around the eyes and when you are ready slowly open them up to the world around you noticing the delicate transition from dark to light as you move forward in outward action continually come back to the intention you are carrying within you knowing that the universe is here to support guide and nourish you with every step that you take [Music] welcome to this guided meditation designed to help you ease into a deep and peaceful sleep while lowering your blood pressure naturally and effectively through mindfulness conscious breathing and deep body visualizations this meditation will create an inner experience of relaxation as well as guide the heart towards a healthy smooth and steady rhythm over the next short while allow my voice to guide you into this deep state of relaxation knowing that the hearts flow will follow suit as you sing further into stillness take some time now to settle into a comfortable lying down position using any blankets and cushions to support your body where needed if possible on the spine and neck should be in line to help open the flow of energy through the entire body tune into your entire body now as you make any final adjustments that will support your progression into a deeply relaxed and peaceful state I invite you now to simply bring your attention to your breath without trying to shift it in any way just gently open your awareness to it observing its natural flow rhythm and depth [Music] [Music] notice the way the breath comes and goes on its own accord guided by an innate wisdom that does not require any effort on your part it simply comes and goes just as the ocean eps and flows [Music] [Music] as you draw awareness to the breath notice if it naturally shifts in any way again there is no need to intervene or manipulate its rhythm but you may find that as you tune into the breath it might naturally deepen slow down or adjust itself in some other way just notice if this is true for you and also notice if it is not there is no right or wrong way to notice the breath simply observe at however it comes and follow it wherever it flows [Music] [Music] throughout this meditation the mind may entangle itself in thoughts of the past or in visions of what might come to be if for when it does simply acknowledge this tendency as a movement away from this present moment before drawing your attention back to the breath if thoughts arise simply witness them for a moment with compassion and non judgment before returning to your unchangeable center no matter how frequently they crop up no that is entirely normal for thoughts to rise and entirely possible to gently let them go use the breath as your anchor at any point during this meditation to reground yourself in the physical place that you rest you [Music] draw your awareness now to the stomach noticing its natural rise and fall as breath moves through you in our busy day to day activities we often breathe primarily from the chest restricting our breaths range of movement this shallow breathing engages our stress response and releases a surge of hormones that temporarily increase our blood pressure as we naturally expand the breaths movement moving it effortlessly into the stomach we activate the relaxation response this deeper breathing pauses out of an inner state of stress and helps us to sink effortlessly into stillness and soon into a state of deep sleep continue to focus your attention on the stomach noticing just how far the breath can go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] take a moment now to acknowledge this physical place you are in without engaging the Mayans analytic capacity is it possible to simply witness the space you occupy to witness the physical world you are intimately connected to [Music] notice the surface that supports you and notice any soft textures around you [Music] draw your awareness to this very simple moment knowing that there is nowhere else you need to be you are nowhere else but right here right now and all that is asked of you is that you open your heart and awareness to this beautiful moment before you fall into a deep and restorative sleep [Music] [Music] as you notice your physical surrounds you may also become more deeply aware of your physical body maintain awareness of the breath flowing through you as you begin to scan the body gently starting at the toes and traveling up to the crown of your head [Music] [Music] there is nothing you need to look for in this process he was simply called to witness whatever exists within you [Music] if any tension or discomfort appears in your awareness simply embrace it with your loving awareness and open your breath up to this area that is calling for your tender love and air [Music] if there are no strong sensations to notice simply grant your entire body with your compassionate attention and let it melt further into stillness [Music] [Music] [Music] feel entirely free to also make any physical adjustments to your positioning that will help to provide you with more comfort if you adjust yourself at any point during this meditation simply do so mindfully and slowly to help foster this growing sense of peace and serenity inhale as you make any movements and exhale deeply as you settle into any new positioning [Music] [Music] hold your physical body in your awareness now as you begin to envision it's sinking deeper and deeper into the surface beneath you or tension is invited to melt away and all muscles are invited to relax completely with each inhalation you are infused with the greatest sense of relaxation and with each exhalation you release any lingering knots of tension or stress [Music] just take a few deep breaths here [Music] envisioning this process that is moving through you inhale relaxation and exhale any remaining tension in the body or mind [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I invite you now to draw your awareness to the heart space and to invite your breath into it breathe slowly and steadily here filling the heart completely on each inhalation and softening it on each exhalation [Music] come to notice the steadiness of the heart space it's slow flow and its openness as you breathe you bring the heart into greater harmony and equilibrium [Music] to slow down even more and to further this process of relaxation begin to add counts of four to your breath on your next inhalation breathe in to a slow count of four pause for a brief moment at the top and then exhale for a full count of four take three full breath cycles here following this guidance if it feels comfortable to you [Music] envision the heart slowing in space [Music] envision it relaxing completely into this moment it is beating naturally and effortlessly without you needing to intervene in any way simply by slowing the breath the heart follows suit simply by engaging in mindful breathing mind body and heart all come closer to complete relaxation [Music] as you settle into a sense of the heart beating slowly and steadily start to expand your field of awareness by imagining the pathways that flow into and away from the heart envision the life force that travels through your heart pumping smoothly and effortlessly this life force your blood nourishes your cells as it flows steadily through your body know that without any effort without any force or manipulation the body is nourishing itself in this very moment open your heart a little bit further with each full breath knowing that you are being supported by the body's innate wisdom right now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] continued to expand the breath envisioning and traveling throughout the entire body where attention goes energy flows as you expand your awareness to encompass the entire physical body life force in all its forms follow in that direction [Music] watching the breath flow steadily know that your blood is traveling in the same manner effortlessly extensively and wholeheartedly as you sink further into stillness trusting the body's wisdom the heart continues to beat slowly and steadily without any effort required on your part there is nothing you need to do and nothing you need to fix in this very moment your body is in harmonious flow [Music] [Music] begin to gently release everything held in the mind any visions thoughts or any mental chatter that may have crept up release it all on your next exhalation as you let go gently imagine the mind dropping down to the heart space slowly unfastening itself from the head space passing through the space between your brows down the nose through mouth and throat and landing softly in the heart without creating any visions thoughts or feelings of what this looks like simply hold your awareness in the heart and explore what it feels like to be in this space continue to breathe deeply through the heart [Music] [Music] in a moment we will enter into a few moments of silence you may choose to retain your breath as your anchor and focus for these moments or if it suits you you may introduce the following information on each inhalation as we sing into silence you may quietly repeat yourself I am flowing and on each exhalation you may repeat I am releasing I am flowing I am releasing I am flowing I am releasing invite this affirmation into your heart now or simply continue to breathe from the heart with your awareness focused on your breath [Music] [Music] [Music] now gently release the affirmation if it is currently passing through you with each breath and come back to the steady rhythm of your heart exactly as it is [Music] let go of all effort all focus and any visions that may still be moving through you as you come quietly into pure beingness as you slowly drift into sleep there is nothing you need to carry with you so begin to shed any remaining thoughts now simply practice for a few more moments this art of pure being you [Music] you let each part of the body soften as you allow this physical space to support your journey into sleep [Music] allow the gentle flow of music to rock you into a deep slumber until you finally come to sleep for the night [Music] continue to breathe deeply and slowly allowing your breath to guide your hearts flow and to guide you into a state of tranquility know that the body's wisdom will continue to support and nourish you throughout the night and that you were deeply supported by the energy flow that makes this life possible [Music] welcome to this powerful guided meditation this mindfulness meditation and visualization will lead you with compassion and curiosity deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation and then into the past before eventually carrying you into a deep and peaceful sleep I invite you to open your heart to this journey to whatever reveals itself knowing that you are unconditionally supported in each and every moment that passes allow the mind to rest aside as we move backwards through time there is nothing you will need to actively search for and nothing you'll need to find images and inner sensations may come for you but you will not need to control them and epilate them or force them in any way simply allow yourself to open up entirely to whatever moves through you as we take this journey allow this meditation in each moment to naturally reveal itself as you move deeper and deeper into the past so before we begin take a moment or two to come into a comfortable lying down position and sure that you feel safe and secure wherever you are ensure that your neck is aligned with the spine and your shoulders are relaxed take a moment to consciously release all muscles as you sink further into this supportive surface beneath you take a few deep breaths here grounding yourself in this present moment use your breath to guide you towards a place of complete stillness [Music] although we will be moving through the expansive field of time you can always ground yourself back into the present moment if you feel uncomfortable at any point you are in complete control of this journey so if any images or sensations arise that are too challenging for you to present Lee look at simply use your breath to anchor yourself back into the present moment you are always always in control of your journey with that said if any challenging images arise or if the experience becomes heavy you are also in an entirely safe domain to explore them images that arise in our consciousness can never hurt us they are solely tools or teachers that hold the potential to guide us forward in powerful and positive ways know that you are universally supported in each and every moment now take a moment to come back to your body notice your sense of touch through the way the surfaces around you make contact with your physical body feel into the textures that are present without moving noting how they feel as they rest against your skin consider the deeper levels of the physical body is it possible to become mindful of the cellular world notice your muscles and then invite them to relax encouraging them to sink further into the surface beneath you now consider the presence of air around your body and then gently follow it as it moves within filling your lungs fully as you take a breath in and returning to the world around you on your exhale allow the breath to become slow and steady just like the subtle lapping of waves against the shoreline [Music] take a few breaths on your own here following the innate rhythm of this life force that supports you [Music] allow yourself to come into a state of relaxation by drawing your breath to the heart space as you inhale allow your heart to expand filling itself to the outer edges with peace joy and clarity [Music] and as you exhale allow the walls of the heart to soften releasing any tension that may be stored there [Music] continue to breathe this way for a few more rounds effortlessly quietening the mind as you move closer and closer towards the true state of your heart [Music] [Music] [Music] begin to notice a growing sense of peace and tranquility as you become more attuned with the ever unfolding present moment in just a few moments we will begin our regression into the past allow your imagination to enrich your visions as you move further and further into the mystical landscape we are about to enter [Music] for just a few moments allow the space before your third eye to empty completely you may still see various colors and swirls of energy passing before you there is no need to change or attempt to control this instead see if you can simply observe whatever is present there just in front of your closed eyes you don't have to judge it or attempt to change it in any way simply notice the space that quietly and safely hold you in complete stillness in just a moment you will sink as far into relaxation as is required for your personal present moment and needs simply follow my voice as I count down guiding you deeper and deeper into a state of all-encompassing peace and tranquility 10 you are feeling safe and secure embraced by this open space 9 all stress and tension is being released with every breath you take 8 you are feeling heavy nourished by the energy around you 7 you are releasing even further 6 every muscle is relaxed 5 you are completely comfortable to let go for sinking further and further 3 the mind is quiet unless you have come to relax completely - you breathe slowly deeply and effortlessly and one you have arrived completely at peace completely relaxed [Music] all is quiet or is at peace now something starts to appear before your eyes out of the vast empty space before you you notice a mist developing it is airy and then chanted somehow beckoning you closer you take a few steps towards this mist very slowly and mindfully and as you approach it begins to dissipate as it slowly clears you begin to see there is a bridge ahead of you covered in moss and vines you make your way towards it mindfully treading on the pressed earth beneath your feet and as you cross over everything you ever knew begins to disappear all thought all attachments all fears and all worries you are entering into a new world into a different time with every step you take you inch closer towards the space and time just on the other side of the bridge it is a place that feels familiar somehow but one that your conscious mind cannot put any memory to the mist continues to clear and you realize you are within a dense majestic forest you feel at home you feel at peace here he reached the other side of the bridge and with the mist having vanished completely now you take a closer look at the scenery around you notice the colors and textures of this vibrant forest consider the way the earth feels beneath your feet you heighten your awareness of the aroma that awakens as you inhale deeply allow this place to nurture the deep sense of peace that is within you you walk forward ever so slightly as you noticed something peeking through from within the trees and as you approach you realize there is a cabin hidden within these woods and somehow you sense that it is or was your own you instantly remember it perhaps becoming flooded with visions of what it was once like in your own time you reach the front door and enter take a few moments to witness the visuals that are arising what does the cabin look like what happened here once upon a time who is with you imagery may come slowly and subtly simply allow them to arise in their own time allow your imagination and intuition to expand quite effortlessly mindfully consider what was once here that no longer remains [Music] you you remain open to whatever arises there is no need to fear the past it no longer has any control over you simply allow yourself to become the outside observer of whatever you feel has happened here watch this film play out as if you are a viewer rather than the character at center stage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] continue to breathe deeply as you simply observe whatever is present without judgment to our condemnation [Music] [Music] as we move through this time we shed old ways of being in order to make room for more expansive ones mindfully begin to consider what messages or lessons are being shared through these images that are arising what is there to be learned what is there to shed allow the mind to remain quiet as your intuition arises tune in with your heart opening yourself to the possibility of transformation [Music] return to your breath and to the aroma of the woods take a few more moments to witness whatever once happened at this beautiful cabin in the forest [Music] and slowly in your own time returned to the bridge slowly crossing back over as you return to the present physical reality you passed through the mist once more making your way to the other side 10 you are breathing deeply 9 you feel inspired and uplifted by what you have learned 8 you are calm and relaxed 7 your breath flows as steady as gentle waves caressing the shore 6 the past fading now 5 you feel deeply connected to the physical world for you exhale deeply letting everything melt away [Music] three you feel gratitude for the present reality you are in two you know that you are whole and complete in this very moment one you have arrived you are home once again you are at peace [Music] with the past now behind you you feel deeply settled within this present moment you know that the past cannot be changed but that it provides opportunity for growth and expansion everything you witnessed now dissipates just as the mist did as you crossed over and into the past you are still and silent and for the moment nothing remains to be seen you continue to allow positive and empowering lessons to reach you as you transition into a sleeping state but you are not in search of anything you are ready to rest easy for the entire night ahead dozing off swiftly and soundly take a few more breaths mindfully inhaling peace contentment and freedom and exhaling everything whatever once was [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the only place that truly exists is this very moment everything that once was can be used as a tool for self-realization at some future moment but for now allow your breath to gently rock you to sleep allow yourself to be nourished throughout the night ahead repeat the following words to yourself in silence as you gently fall into a deep slumber I am at home I am supported I am at peace I am home I am supported I am at peace I am home I am supported I am at peace I sleep deeply and with ease I sleep deeply and with ease tonight I choose to sleep in peace tonight I choose to sleep in peace I

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation as you prepare for a deep and nourishing sleep this meditation will guide you into manifesting a beautiful and loving relationship of your highest dreams one that is in alignment with your truest self the relationship that you come to manifest will be aligned with your own unique needs and personal journey perhaps it is a romantic partner you are currently attracting or a deeper friendship of some other form regardless of what your heart most deeply yearns for this meditation will help you to manifest that relationship upon a foundation of trust allowing you to rest easy and sing into a deep and enriching sleep [Music] so before we begin I invite you to make yourself comfortable using any desired cushions or blankets for support and warmth and adjust your body so that it rests comfortably allow the body to move itself so that any physical or tension or tightness can begin the process of release so just prepare yourself and your environment in any way necessary so that this day may be left behind set any alarms now and turn off all lights if your mind and body a moment to sink into this place and time exactly as it is knowing that there is nothing more to do or to be taken care of [Music] now take a moment to connect with your breath without trying to change it or manipulate it in any way I invite you to simply become aware of its natural flow our breath carries an innate wisdom of its own and does not need to be altered in any way while it is sometimes beneficial to deepen or direct the breath in certain manners for right now I invite you to simply be very present with the natural state of your being [Music] there may be aspects of the day that linger in your mind or there may be thoughts about tomorrow if any of these sorts of thoughts exist within you simply witness them acknowledging that they are not required in this very moment remind yourself that there is nothing to be done here and now all that is required of you is deep presence with your breath and with this moment [Music] [Music] [Music] draw your attention now to the hard space as you breathe allow the heart to gently expand with each inhalation and gently soften with each exhalation take a few silent breaths here from your heart center as you begin to soften its walls and open to the endless possibilities of love and deep connection love is abundant its presence is everywhere and as you sink further into this meditation you will begin to touch the truth that love exists all around and within each of us [Music] you are invited now to cultivate an awareness of and an appreciation for your innate radiance beauty and divinity [Music] in order to manifest and outer love it is necessary to first acknowledge the inner one complete and perfect in and of itself if any thoughts arise attempting to intervene with your experience of self-love simply witness them and then allow these thoughts to gently melt away as swiftly as they came [Music] take a few moments right now to gently introduce the words I am made of love I am made of love I am made of love just allow these words to flow into the heart space with each breath allow them to soften the heart further dissolving any preconceived notions that may stand in their way [Music] it may not come easily to self love it may trigger a rising resistance and know that if this is the case this too is okay know that any resistance does not make the truth of your innate beauty and radiance less valid resistance that arises is simply born of prior conditioning that has led us to forget the truth that we are in fact made of love love runs through each of our cells and as we become more aware of its presence within us we are able to attract more of it from the outer world so take a few more moments to allow these words to permeate your being I am made of love I am made of love I am made of love [Music] if any emotions arise know that this is entirely okay allow these emotions to free you allow them to melt away taking limiting notions along with them as they disobeyed emotions are often tired with words and stories if stories emerge in the mind simply acknowledge them without allowing them to attach themselves to you you are made of love any wording or stories that contradict this truth is not born of your truest nature so take three more deep breaths with these words held in mind and heart I am made of love I am made of love I am made of love [Music] [Music] [Music] bring your awareness back to the heart space now continually allowing this space within you to expand and soften with each full breath each breath through the heart cleanses and nourishes your being freeing up constricted energy that no longer serves your highest purpose and your dreams as you breathe releasing unloving notions and embracing the truth of who you are begin to feel the heart expanding beyond the chest as its walls soften you find that the heart begins to touch the outside world with a deep awareness for the unlimited and unbounded nature of love you might like to envision a white light expanding from the heart reaching to touch each area of the body and beyond [Music] your entire being is bathed in this white loving light as all motions in contradiction to love melt away you are whole and complete here love radiates from your being [Music] [Music] [Music] as you sink further into this state of relaxation allow your highest mind to conjure up visions of qualities you were deeply attracted to in

your highest mind and heart to conspire in creating the love of your dreams what you seek is seeking you allow it to come naturally into both the mental emotional and physical realms there is no need

peaceful state at any moment it's a reminder as you settle in that you have given yourself this gift of meditation bring your awareness to the natural rhythm of your breath at first simply notice the sensations that accompany your breath maybe you feel a slightly cool sensation as the air passes through your nostrils perhaps you feel a floating sensation as your abdomen and chest rise and fill with breath or a heaviness as the air moves out of your body taking with it any tension or tightness whatever you are feeling is just right simply observe the experience as you inhale sense an opening or a creation of spaciousness at the area of your heart and when you exhale feel a gentle compression in this area as your lungs are giving your heart a hug this internal support from your inner companion is available to you with each and every breath you take so knowing this you can be comforted that you are always supported from within allow this support welcome the breath invite the inner hug shortly i will guide you to take several deep breaths sensing first your inhale and then inviting your exhale to be slightly longer than your inhale you can always welcome a short pause after you exhale trusting that your body will know when to breathe in again begin to intentionally inhale deeply and extend your exhale slightly longer than your inhale after you exhale welcome a brief pause for the length of time that feels comfortable for you today and breathe in again trusting you know the timing that is right for you continue this way and trust the wisdom of your body in connection with your inner companion allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical or emotional stress and tension [Music] by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will naturally slow [Music] your body and mind will calm down in response trust and allow i'll remain quiet as you enjoy this practice for the next few moments when your mind wanders simply begin again and guide your focus back to your breath [Music] so release this breath pattern now [Music] and as your breath returns to its natural rhythm notice the change in how you feel let gravity settle over you there is no need to hold against it anymore there is no need to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders any longer notice any areas in your body where you may be holding on to tension or tightness and invite a sense of ease to wash over you give yourself permission to enjoy letting go into relaxation now is your time to be fully supported to let go and relax anywhere you can as you observe your body soften and release any areas you are able invite the feeling of peace as you begin to tune out the whole world around you [Music] and go within with my voice as a soothing guide to help you sleep now follow the sound of my voice as i guide your attention on a relaxed journey moving your attention through various parts of your body without effort let go of stories or expectations of these parts of your body and notice them as if meeting them for the first time [Music] as your focus flows your energy will follow and this will invite ease into your body [Music] as your physical body continues to relax become aware of the sensations at your forehead notice your right eye and your left eye relax the tiny muscles and nerves in and around both of your eyes and feel as your eyelids become heavy [Music] sense your right cheek from the outside as well as from inside your mouth [Music] now your left cheek outside and inside your mouth allow both of your cheeks to soften inside and out become aware of the right side of your jaw and the left side of your jaw unclench both sides of your jaw and allow your teeth to part gently move your attention to the inside of your mouth now notice your gums and your tongue soften now that your face eyes and mouth are completely relaxed consider the idea of a smile the part of a smile we can see and that we associate with the word smile is on the face we recognize a smile in the eyes the turning up of the corners of the mouth a glow over the entire face there is so much this simple gesture can convey to another person as well as make us feel from within this is only part of how a smile can be experienced throughout the entire body [Music] this is only a fraction of how a smile can be expressed sense a relaxed smile on your face now [Music] perhaps it feels artificial at first allow the smile to move over your entire face [Music] a smile can change your mood change how you feel about yourself and others it can alter your perspective and bring joy to your state of being as you explore and connect with your physical experience look inward and consider what it would feel like to draw a connection between a smile on your face with a smiling at your heart how would it feel to be smiling from your heart perhaps you might experience a smile of the heart with each inhale as your chest rises [Music] and your collarbones widen then each exhale your lungs continue to give your heart another hug as you inhale in your mind think i am smiling as you exhale in your mind think i am supporting myself with a hug invite the sensations of the smile from your face to move down to the space around your heart allow these smiling qualities to surround you like a warm embrace of a loved one connect with your smile with every breath you take as a reminder to come back to yourself if you find your mind wandering lovingly bring your attention back to your smile and to each breath inhale i am smiling exhale i am supporting myself with a hug [Music] a smile tells your body that you are okay a smile tells you that you can accept joy and happiness keep your attention on your smile on the sensations of your smile on your face and on your heart and on the joyful emotions your smile can evoke a smile can unravel the tension and help you let go of negativity continue to stay with the sensations of your smile allow it to relax you even more deeply allow your smile to bring joy contentment and peace a smile is the language of the soul the language of the body let your smile be an expression of your inner companion that you are your

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided bedtime meditation that will help you to fall asleep quickly and soundly over the course of this meditation you will move deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation releasing all physical tension before being guided into a beautiful visualization that will enhance your inner sense of peace and tranquility there is nothing required for you to actively do here you are simply invited to open your mind as you are guided naturally towards a peaceful slumber before you settle into the space you're in take a moment to ensure that your blinds are drawn and your morning alarm is set when you're ready to put the day behind you and sure you're in a comfortable lying down position as you prepare for complete release and relaxation use any blankets and cushions to support yourself as necessary and when you are in utmost comfort take a few slow and grounding breaths to connect with this moment in space and time [Music] the breath is a gateway into the present moment and into deep release and greater alignment though this invisible life forced often goes overlooked it is one of the most powerful tools of relaxation available to us in any given moment so take this opportunity now to witness the breath to simply observe its depth and rhythm allowing it to deepen as you naturally ease your way into this period of darkness draw your attention to the stomach noticing the way the breath follows suit as we consciously welcome our breath into the belly we initiate the body's relaxation response lowering stress hormones blood pressure muscle tension and our breathing rate inhale all the way into the base of the spine and then exhale completely softening all muscles as you surrender a little bit further now I invite you to introduce small pauses between inhalation and exhalation resting in complete stillness for just a moment after each in-breath and each out breath so it's going to be inhale to a count of four pause for a brief moment and then exhale completely for a count of four pausing for just a moment of complete stillness once again witness the body relaxing more fully as you breathe in the slow and steady way for three more rounds on your own now [Music] gently release your attention from the breath now tuning into the visceral sensations of the body hold the entire body in your awareness for a few moments noticing if there's any physical tension or contraction present if you come across any area in need of love and release just gently draw your breath towards this region on your next inhalation inviting nourishing light to support your full release and as you exhale allow all tightness and all tension to dissipate feeling yourself sink more completely into the surface beneath you as you welcome release into the physical body through your breath the mind naturally follows suit moving into greater peace and harmony so follow my voice as you are guided through the body using the power of your attention to grant full release begin by a breathing loving-kindness into the feet area releasing any heaviness that may be stored here breathe into the legs now thanking these limbs for carrying you throughout your day and then allowing them to relax completely into this moment [Music] inhale deeply now into the hips and pelvis softening and releasing on the exhalation and then move to the belly allowing your core muscles to relax and the breath to flow effortlessly into this area of the body [Music] hope in your heart and chest now as you breathe nourishing lifeforce into this center of your pain softening on the exhale [Music] soften your hands allowing them to sink into the surface beneath you and then grant the same release to your arms just letting them melt away for the night soften your shoulders your neck region your jaw your cheeks and nose and your eyes take a moment to soften the eyebrows in the forward just allowing all mental tension to dissipate as you release all muscles surrounding your thinking mind hold your entire body in your awareness now allowing it to be completely at peace in this present moment return to your breath for a couple more cycles noticing once again the short pauses in between each in-breath and each out breath now feeling physically relaxed and in alignment with this present moment I invite you to tune in to the mind's eye without force or strain allow the following visualization to conjure images of deep peace and tranquility as you move gracefully into a deep slumber for the night in your open field of vision now begin to visualize you're on a tropical island feet firmly grounded into the warm crystals of sand that stretch out to either side of you where you rest the waters are shallow off the coast lending themselves to crystal clear turquoise hues and the most beautiful waters you have ever laid eyes on the salty breeze infiltrates your nostrils and you exhale deeply feeling yourself sink further into this paradise island that warms both body and soul you take a few steps forward slowly eventually coming to dip your toes in the warm yet refreshing waters that surround this small Paradise Island standing at a balance point between ocean and earth ankle deep in those turquoise waters inner peace flows through you as you come to realize you are whole and complete just as you are you yearn to dive into the healing salty waters before you and so prepare yourself for this descent when you are ready you begin to walk slowly and mindfully away from the steady Shore step by step until soon your lower legs are submerged you continue walking slowly and with grace until soon you are waist-deep in these cleansing waters you pause here tracing the surface of the ocean with your fingertips and when you are ready you reach your arms ahead of you as you shallow dive into the crystal clarity that now bathes your entire body as each crystal bead of ocean rushes along your skin you feel restored and renewed turning onto your back you allow your body to float on the still surface the ocean is calm and quiet nestling you continually into a peaceful state that lives both within and around you the salt water cleanses your skin rejuvenating your physical body energetically it penetrates deeper healing and nourishing your spiritual and emotional bodies all trapped emotions and all old energy systems are absorbed by the healing potential of these waters this process of renewal leaves you free to relax completely floating here on the surface of the water you are in a state of complete bliss [Music] the mind softens entirely nothing tethered to it any longer any thoughts that do rise in your consciousness are released to the ocean as swiftly as they came you know that any thoughts or emotions that arise do not belong to you there are simply bodies of energy coming like waves before dissolving back into the wholeness of the ocean [Music] Aya's transfixed with the sky you notice the lighting and shade overhead is shifting blue hues now blend into a subtle orange signifying that the Sun is now setting behind the horizon you take this as a cue to return to land turning back towards the beach and the canopy of palm trees that overhang it you return to your feet gliding out of the water slowly step by step you finally come to reach land and find that a plush towel neatly folded on the warm sand has been sent for you by the universe you wrap yourself in this warm soothing towel and begin to walk slowly down the beach into the sunset as you walk you open your senses to this environment you notice the aroma of the salty air continually cleansing you with each breath you taste the salt on the outer edges of your lips left behind from your healing dip in the ocean you hear the gentle rustling of palm trees a subtle lapping of water against the shore and the sound of release that comes with each deep exhale you make tuning into your sense of touch you feel the warmth and comfort of the towel against your skin as well as the sweetness of sand beneath your feet staring ahead you see the crest of beautiful palm trees the white sand slowly becoming darker as night approaches and the vibrant sky now orange and magenta as the Sun has disappeared behind the horizon just a dozen yards ahead of you firmly grounded in the shallow waters by sturdy stilts you see an overwater bungalow connected to the shore by a long wooden dock this is your own private Cabana where you will sleep the night away in tranquillity step-by-step continuing to move slowly and mindfully you make your way back to the dock you arrive at the foot of it and see that string lights lie in both railings as you make your way towards your private bungalow by ferry light you feel the day behind you dissipating naturally you reach the end of the dock arriving at the door of your Cabana turning the handle you make your way inside and admire the beautiful warm interiors that nourish mind body and spirit a large glass window who reacquaint you with the Sun when it rises and fresh fruits will energize your body when morning arrives for now you turn your full attention to the four-poster bed in the center of the room a plush white quilt is draped over top and white lace curtains pulled back and tied elegantly to each side preparing a suffering deep slumber you climb inside this cozy and welcoming bed ready to rest peacefully for the night so that you may wake inspired and energized when morning comes notice the comfort of the blankets and cushions that support you here notice the peace and quiet that beckons you into a deep slumber all you hear are the subtle sounds of the ocean and your own slow steady breathing take a few last moments to revel in this beauty of this setting soaking it up in spirit gently allow the visuals to dissipate returning to your physical reality carrying the same peace and stillness you've found there by the ocean you are safe and supported here resting peacefully and soundly as you slowly slip into a deep slumber as you drift off to sleep allow the following affirmations to fill every cell of your being positively transforming the world

1 [Music] [Laughter] [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided visualization it's designed to promote peace of mind for returned soldiers experiencing post-traumatic stress upon returning home before we move into this visual journey I would like to acknowledge that this recording is not a replacement for professional support but rather it is a tool that can help you to explore the possibility of finding a safe and comfortable place within yourself it is an anchor into the present moment of course I encourage anyone listening to this to seek the support that they need from professionals and use this meditation solely as a peaceful way to help you find peace and release during those quiet moments before falling asleep so before we begin I invite you to make sure that you are entirely comfortable in the place that you are now in if there's anything that brings you extra peace and comfort reach out for these now and this could be as simple as your pillow a sacred object on your bedside table or anything at all that brings you more comfort so making sure that you're in a comfortable lying down position and take a few full settling breaths here as you ground yourself into this space at any point during this meditation or at any point throughout the days and nights to come I invite you to remember that your breath is always available as an anchor into the present moment each time we draw our awareness to the breath the past disappears the future disappears and we are reminded of the stillness that lives in this very moment breath awareness requires nothing but your attention and can be practiced at any time for just a few seconds or for many so right now follow my voice for the next short while as you deepen your awareness of this life force that flows in and out of your body constantly as you inhale become more observant of your sensory experience as the air flows into your nostrils through your windpipe and deep into your lungs [Music] and as you exhale witness the release that occurs as the belly softens the chest falls and your mind just drops away continue to breathe with this heightened awareness paying close attention to the pauses in between each breath cycle so after each inhalation see if you can notice the complete stillness where the breath is held for just a brief second and after each exhalation observe that momentary stillness after all the air has been released and just in your own time repeating this observation on your own for a few more breaths cycles [Music] [Music] know that wherever you have been whatever lingers from days now behind you you exist nowhere but in this present moment reality allow the breath and your physical body to remind you of this moving deeply into your physical presence anytime the mind wanders into stories or images of the past you are here you are held by your breath your body and spirit right here [Music] while we cannot change what has happened in the past we can continually draw ourselves more affirmative ly into today by welcoming ourselves exactly as we are into the reality of this present moment we find space to honor where we've been while also knowing that we are only ever right here right now this is the only time we truly have so in just a moment you will be guided through a safe and soothing visualization to help you tune into more completely to the present moment take a few more slow and steady breaths and just after a few cycles let's begin [Music] you [Music] shifting your attention now away from your breath and into the empty space behind your closed eyes and this space holds infinite potential for freedom and release when we adorn it with images of peace and light and love so upon this blank canvas I invite you to witness yourself appearing in a place that provides you with a sense of safety and love for you this might be a particular outdoor landscape or it might be an indoor space it might be a setting from your childhood or a place that exists today or it could even be from your imagination [Music] there are no rules as to what this space looks like so long as it provides you with the sense that you are safe supported and held exactly as you are [Music] explore this space as you please tuning into any and all of your senses that are appropriate here what does the imagery evoke within you are there any aromas textures or tastes that bring about a sense of peace and security [Music] what sounds are present in the space that surround you if there are no sounds can the silence carry you deeper into stillness and contentment [Music] take a full nourishing inhale and as you exhale just gently release any tension fear or worry letting it go [Music] now I invite you to welcome other beings into this space if it feels comfortable for you whoever brings you a sense of peace and love is welcome here perhaps you invite friends to join you family members [Music] professionals you've worked with or pets while these beings cannot free you of your past they can support you in your journey as you move forward if you feel more at peace in this space alone know that this is entirely okay as well from moment to moment we require different things sometimes it is the support of those who love us sometimes it is our personal connection to our highest self to nature to universe if the latter is true for you in this moment invite your higher self the natural world or your understanding of God or the universe into the space within you even if you have welcomed humans or pets into the visualization already you too may also invite these deeper connections to support you right now if emotions arise simply acknowledge them and witness them as passing clouds tuning in to how they feel within the body rather than the story that they weave in the mind just trust that this beautiful safe space you have created as the capacity to hold you exactly as you are and know that there is no weakness in feeling emotion our emotions are a part of what makes us human and they are entirely welcome here [Music] continually returned to the peaceful imagery around you and to whatever you have conjured here that brings you peace [Music] now wherever you have found yourself in this visualization I invite you to take a seat on the earth or on a couch or any other surface that fits your environment just getting comfortable you might conjure up any supportive elements that make you feel at home you might light a few candles in your mind's eye or surround yourself with any other sacred objects that settle you I invite you to visualize a photo album presenting itself on the floor or a small table before you inscribed in golden cursive print on the cover the album reads for safe keeping in the soul this album has presented itself for you so that you may have a safe space to place any recurring images or dreams about the past whatever you have witnessed and experienced cannot be taken away from you however the past can be laid gently to rest tucked away in a safe corner of the soul to inspire the next stage of your life's purpose take the album in your hands breathing deeply as you hold it in quiet reverence [Music] if any challenging thoughts or images arise in your consciousness turn these into photographs and tuck them gently into your album laying the past down this way in help to honor where you've been while creating space for lighter imagery and experiences to take root this is not a denial of where you have been but it may serve as a reminder that these images are snapshots of the past and now you have a brighter lighter future to look forward to [Music] [Music] [Music] take a few more silent moments to respectfully tuck away any old photographs that no longer need to take up space in the forefront of your mind if the imagery does not arise naturally or if it is too painful for you to process in this way at this time tune into the natural rhythm of your breath as you quietly repeat the words right here right now I am safe right here right now I am safe you I invite you to close the photo album now knowing that you can come back to it at any time you need to store the passed away for safekeeping and remember that none of this is a denial of the life you have lived it is simply a way of clearing space for new life to emerge take a few final moments now to tune back into the beautiful room or landscape you have visualized using your breath to ground you here for just a few more moments look around at the support systems that are available to you friends family members plants and animals support professionals your highest self the universe anything else in which you find peace meaning and contentment come back to your breath remembering that this very simple life force that we so often take for granted is a pathway back to the present moment back into peace gently now allow the scene you have created to begin dissolving as you reconnect with your awareness of your body in the room and physically support you allow each muscle to soften melting further into the surface beneath you draw the mind down into the heart space thanking yourself for harnessing the courage and Trust required to move through this journey now as you gently surrender into sleep allow the following affirmations to fuel your continued evolution bringing you deeper into peace contentment and release you may like to mentally repeat these affirmations as you drift off into sleep I love and honor myself I love and honor myself [Music] I am supported by the world around

1 you [Music] hello I'm Jason Stephenson and welcome to this healing meditation designed to enhance your experience of physical and emotional well-being as you prepare for a deeply restorative sleep during this guided meditation you will bring compassion and healing attention to different parts of the body and mind before finding your way into a deep slumber I invite you now to open your heart to the transformative capacity of this meditation and to that of your own inner being [Music] before we begin take a moment to ensure that everything in the outside world is turned off or put away for the day the lights and any alerts on your phone or other devices are turned off and preferably the blinds are drawn ensuring that all end of day tasks are taken care of will help you to immerse yourself in this meditation and into deeply healing sleep once all of the outside requirements are taken care of take some time to ensure that you're in a comfortable lying down position ensure that the body is relaxed and well supported as you come to find stillness wherever you are [Music] gently closing your eyes and take a moment now to see if you can feel into the physical space that supports you notice the way your body is held in the safety and solidity of the physical world know that it is safe for you to let go to allow any held tension to melt away in this very moment [Music] [Music] whatever presents itself during this or during any meditation is entirely welcomed it is safe for you to be fully present within your experience allow your own inner strength my voice and the deep silence to guide you through this meditation you are well taken care of within your own presence begin to witness the way that breath flows through you come to see how effortlessly it fills your physical body and then how naturally it glides back into the outer environment for a few moments now draw your attention to your breath allowing it to ground you in this present moment [Music] [Music] the outside world gently falls away as you are guided continuously via the breath back into this very moment in time now without attempting to change your breath in any way I invite you to draw your attention to the belly simply observe the way it rises and the way it falls and notice what happens to the breath as you draw your attention to the stomach what happens to the body is there a softening or possibly a sense of release is the ease or unease whatever may be the case for you simply acknowledge what is present within the body as you shift your attention from breath to belly [Music] [Music] [Music] getting to know the body in this way facilitates your ability to heal itself this type of getting to know the body is not intellectual in any way it's experiential through this meditation you're invited to become more intimate with the physical body witnessing it exactly as it rests here right in this very moment by practicing this deep presence we shift from thinking into feeling and into being by allowing the body to be exactly as it is and by bringing our awareness to it we begin to soften the mental preconceptions maintaining their firm grip on our beliefs about the body gently allow any firmly held concepts to melt away allowing a deeper experience of full openness and presence to take its place [Music] come back to the breath for a few moments allowing it to continually carry you into each unfolding moment breath by breath moment by moment [Music] I invite you now to expand the scope of your breath on your next inhalation gently guide or envision the breath spanning all the way down to your toes and on the next exhalation guide the breath to the top of your head nourishing each part as it passes continue to envision the breath looping gently through your body this way softening every area of stress or tension that it touches take a few moments of silence here allowing the breath to soothe every cell of your body [Music] as you come to be more in touch with the body on a deeper level take a moment to consider that you are made up of trillions of cells each of these cells intermingles with the others in order to keep you alive and well as you rest in meditation the body welcomes this space and time provided to heal itself on a deep level sale a level know that right now the body is taking care of itself to bring you into a greater sense of vitality and wellness so take a moment now to gently scan the body noticing any spiraling sensations of energy moving through you as you come to feel the body on an energetic level see if you begin to consciously touch the cellular level of the body take a few moments of silence here to dive into the subtle realms of the body to those parts that go invisible to the eye [Music] draw your awareness naturally to various areas of the body allowing yourself to be guided by your inner compass simply notice what you notice simply allow yourself to feel what you feel your own inner wisdom will guide you let any notions about what this experience should be like just to fall away and as you move deeply into yourself take time to notice any areas of tension pain or discomfort [Music] now this pain or discomfort may be primarily physical it may be emotional or energetic simply notice what areas of your being are calling to you for healing take a moment to focus on one area of the body or mind that is speaking to you through discomfort or tension as you bring your attention to this area allow your breath to follow this awareness just gently and naturally allow your breath and your inner capacity for compassion to touch this place [Music] without trying to change anything about this experience allow the discomfort to be bathed by the warmth of your breath and by your loving presence so take a few moments of silence here as you allow your body to heal on a cellular level [Music] you [Music] now gently loosen your attention coming back to the rhythm of your natural breath remember that your breath is your anchor and if at any point your mind wanders your breath is always available to redirect you to your present experience so come now to a different area of the body or mind to a second aspect of you in need of a little extra support care or tenderness invite this place into your awareness as you cleanse it with your inner infinite well of love and kindness hold it compassionately in your field of awareness allowing the breath to soothe it and as you breathe let any tension or pain that is held there to slowly soften [Music] continue to breathe consciously as we enter a few moments of silence during which you may dedicate your love and attention to this second area of your being [Music] [Music] gently softening your inner gaze come back to the steady flow of your breath allow yourself to feel into a deeper stillness and sense of relaxation that is present to you right now know that your body is being healed energetically physically and emotionally as you rest here in stillness so come now to one more area of the body physical emotional or otherwise energetic that is calling for your attention do not seek for anything to come to you simply allow it to enter into your awareness if you are now feeling deeply healed and relaxed and no specific aspect of your being is appearing hold your entire body in the field of your awareness now breathe into the area that has come to you or into your entire body with a warm and loving presence allow yourselves to transform as we speak perhaps feeling their energetic presence within the body and mind bathe in this loving attention allowing the breath to nourish and to heal [Music] [Music] I invite you now to soften your attention once more gently releasing whatever it is holding as you return to your breath this time notice a profound sense of peace and relaxation coming over your entire being on a cellular level you are being transformed this healing radiates out to all different aspects of you holding you in a divine sense of peace wholeness and vitality [Music] breathe deeply now releasing any remaining tension on each exhale [Music] continue to draw your attention to the breath as you sink deeper and deeper into your innate wholeness [Music] as we prepare for sleep who will come to release all areas of the body gently and naturally allow my voice to guide you towards each body part and as I name each part simply hold this piece of you in your awareness and then allow it to let go of any remaining tension stress or other sensation allow each part of you to sink into a deeper relaxation so let's begin with the toes holding them in your awareness [Music] and gently releasing them moving your awareness now to your feet the whole of your feet and letting go releasing in the same way [Music] moving up to your ankles let go [Music] and you're both lower legs getting a sense of the space that these take up release your knees underneath your knees the upper legs [Music] and your hips [Music] now witnessin relax the entirety of both legs breathe into them breathe out draw your attention now to the pelvis [Music] feeling it's often and awareness to the buttocks just let go

torso relaxing all areas of the back and front whilst making your way to the heart center your chest and upper back feel this area soften [Music] witnessin relax the entire core of your body [Music] now bringing your loving awareness now to your fingertips your thumbs feeling the space between each of your fingers [Music] your hands just release let them go both of your wrists [Music] lower arms and feel your elbows soften moving up to your upper arms and your shoulders taking note of your shoulders we can store a lot of tension here just being aware of your shoulders and gently hold now the entirety of both arms in your awareness and slowly release them allowing them to rest in stillness fully relaxed [Music] bring your attention now to your neck area and releasing any contraction or tightness let go of your jaw [Music] and becoming aware of your mouth just allow it to be there loose and soft maybe slightly opened [Music] the nose and cheeks and relax your closed eyes and your eyebrows soften the furrowed allowing any tension held here just to melt away and hold the top of your head in your awareness the back of your head [Music] and now your entire head allowing it to release any unease that may be present [Music] envision your whole body now entirely relaxed and healed emotionally physically and energetically sensor lightness to your being radiating out from each cell of your body in this moment you are free relaxed and full of health and vitality so coming back now to your breath allowing each inhalation and each exhalation to continually nourish and support you [Music] as you rest in this space you begin to sense the lightness of your body and mind moving closer towards sleep allow yourself now to drift into the dream world and naturally know that the cellular healing will continue while you sleep your body's wisdom will continue to restore your being with each breath [Music] as you rest here peacefully come to notice a wider light pulsating from the heart space within its glow it carries love lightness and the capacity for deep healing become aware of it expanding slowly nurturing each part of the body that it touches this white light consumes everything in its way leaving no part of the body or mind untouched it holds the capacity to transform your being and to bring you health vitality and radiance over time this white light comes to touch every part of the body from the edge of your toes to the top of your head it goes so far as to expand to fill the room outside the perceived boundaries of your being everything in your mind's eye now rests in this healing white light nothing is too dark or too heavy to be illuminated the white glow softens your body and mind carrying you naturally into a deeply restorative slumber

1 hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this soothing nighttime meditation designed to help you to fully relax and to let go this will include a body scan meditation as we move through this meditation allow my voice and the sound of rainfall to guide you through this process of deep release and restoration know that you are safe and supported throughout this meditation in each and every moment that unfolds you to come into a comfortable lying down position any resting position will do but try to ensure that your chest is open and your neck is in line with your spine just sink a little bit further into the surface that supports you the physical world will nurture you throughout the journey so feel free to invite the intention to surrender to your body and mind at this present moment letting yourself sink deeply into the physical space beneath you to help affirm moment to repeat the following words after me I am free to let go I am free to let go I am free to let go now gently release any and all words that are circulating within the mind as you open your heart and body allowing them to guide the way this meditation is aimed to help you release tension in the body and to let go of all stress and unease that is present in the mind as we move through life it is not uncommon to become weighed down by things that have happened in the past by things we think we are by things we think that other people are by fears about the future and while there are doubtedly many challenges that exist in this human experience we can help to reset both body and mind by consciously inviting ourselves to surrender or resistance to this present moment because the truth is that cannot harm you cannot harm you is here to nourish and support you so take a few deep breaths now as you remind yourself that you are entirely safe right here right now you now draw your awareness to the natural rhythm of your breath without trying to change it in any way simply observe its flow and depth in this moment you notice any sensations that are present as you inhale deeply through the nose and as you exhale completely allowing your lungs and belly to soften entirely you notice the sound of the breath makes notice the way the breath interacts with the physical body putting any visceral sensations as it moves through you a few moments of silence he simply observing your direct experience of the breath right at this moment you draw your attention now to the belly and observe the way the breath follows you there allow each inhalation to expand the stomach completely exhalation to soften the belly letting all tension and contraction of muscles melt away the depths of the belly as you breathe allowing your breath to move freely to the furthest corners of the body you as we mindfully allow the breath to touch deeper reaches of the respiratory system we unconsciously activate the body's relaxation response this response helps to slow a racing heart sue the worried mind and release tense muscles take a few moments of silence now to consciously observe the belly and the breath flowing in harmony you I invite you now to tune into your sense of sound labeling or judging anything that filters through your ears simply become aware of the vibrations that enter your awareness sounds maybe near subtle hole loud just note them without hanging on to them allowing them to come and go the way waves and flow you now as you tune into the sound of the rain beginning to fill your eardrums begin to observe the way it cleanses your body of everything it has been holding on to for some time rain is a beautiful and powerful tool of transformation that will help to nourish and cleanse your entire being through your journey so surrender gently now to the healing rain that falls through your awareness carry your attention away from your sense of sound now as you move more deeply into your sense of touch take a moment to observe each area of your physical body that is in contact with the surface beneath you see if you can notice the temperature and texture of each surface that is nestled against your skin see if you can release a little bit further still into the bed or any other surface that support you now to prepare the soil for the mind to feel free and safe to let go of all worried and repetitive thoughts let us move more deeply into the body I invite you now to follow my voice as I guide you through a complete body scan to help you release all tight muscles both conscious and unconscious as you listen simply allow your attention to move to the area's you hear mentioned consciously inviting release and relaxation to each of these parts so let's begin by taking three full breaths while holding awareness of your body as a whole there is no need to actively change anything right now just simply observe now draw your attention to your left toes feeling into them with just your awareness as we move through this exercise try to refrain from moving sing if you can witness each area while maintaining complete stillness so breathing into your left toes noticing their presence and then on your next exhalation release any and all tension that resides there completely allowing them to be entirely free within this moment of stillness witness and release all tension in your left foot now inhaling and exhaling as you observe this area of the body move up to the ankle breathing into this space and then exhaling softening completely witness and release the lower left leg breathing in and out of the left knee area and the upper left leg so hold the entire left leg in your awareness now inhaling nourishment into this area of the body and exhaling or stress tension and unease now draw your awareness to the right toes inhaling deeply and then releasing them on the next exhale and continue in the same way as you observe the right foot the right ankle the lower right leg the knee and the upper right leg and take a moment now to hold your entire right leg in your awareness welcoming deep release on the inhalation and inviting it to let go completely on your next exhalation bring your awareness now to your pelvis breathing down to your pelvis and release and your hips and to the buttocks allowing each of these areas to sink deeply into the surface beneath you as you come to fully relax each part witness and release your belly the lower back and then gently draw your awareness up to the spine consciously relaxing the muscles all around your vertebrae as you draw your awareness upwards inhale deeply into the full capacity of the lungs and then exhale slowly allowing your chest to completely relax continue to observe the sounds around you allowing the distant rain to wash your physical body clean of all stressors and thoughts that may have been unconsciously lodged away witness and relax your left fingers now into your left hand your left wrist and lower left arm observe and then release a tightness or contraction in the elbow and the upper left arm and moving slowly until finally reaching the left shoulder just hold your entire left arm in your awareness as you let go of all discomfort and tension stored in this area of the body draw your awareness now to the right fingertips and to the right hand release or discomfort in the right wrist and breathing into the lower right arm the elbow and the upper right arm breathing deeply and then exhale allowing the shoulders to soften as well just witness and release the entire right arm now now observe the neck area letting go of anything stored in the throat region so to fully relax this area take a deep inhalation and as you exhale release a deep sigh through your escaping breath and notice the way the rest of the body is reminded to soften as you do this relax your jaw the cheeks and the nose draw your attention now to all the small muscles around your eyes and forward consciously inviting them to let go of all stress they may be carrying observe and relax the top of your head inviting all thoughts to dissolve as you become more and more tuned into the simplicity of the present moment and finally hold your entire body in your awareness catch the mind when it attempts to search for something prove something or chase something just accept this present moment experience - the way it is reminding yourself that there is nothing to do nothing to prove and nothing you need to be you are already enough right here right now take a few more minutes to breathe into the fullness of your body imagine your breath reaching all the way down to the tips of each limb follow your breath all the way there watching and nourishing the entire body as it moves through every inch of your being so take a moment now to let everything melt away as you tune into the sound of the rain falling all around you open your ears fully as the rain cleanses your body mind and heart if you notice your thoughts wandering at any point simply observe this wandering as a tendency of the mind without attaching yourself to the ideas or stories it is drifting too it is easy to become swept away by the current of the mind but as we practice gently releasing these thoughts streams we find that we become more like the rock bed beneath the stream still solid and deeply rooted to the present moment now open your awareness more intently to the sounds around you once again rain continues to fall washing away or thoughts and stories that no longer serve you take a moment now to imagine yourself lying in a safe space that is open to the elements witness yourself resting peacefully here perhaps directly on the earth or perhaps supported by blankets or cushions observe the area around you someplace with lush greenery bright blossoms that have been nourished by the falling rains witness the way the rain falls upon your body nurturing you much the same way that it supports and nourishes the plant life around you as the rain falls down you begin to grow out of an older version of you out of older stories out of old attachments and out of any confinements imposed on you by the mind you begin to blossom the rain is warm against your skin comforting you as it gently Falls take a moment to simply observe yourself here in this moment witnessing your entire being resting completely at peace beneath the softness of rain that trickles down as thoughts arise within the mind observe them as the energy bodies that do not belong to you and then practice raising them ever so slightly so that they come to rest on the surface of your skin somewhere along your forehead and as the rain trickles down what should carry these thoughts away with it gliding effortlessly away from your body and down down down into the earth the earth and rain paired together are a powerful tool of transformation the earth helps to ground to hold energies freeing up space for new life to be born while the rain helps to improve flow in the physical world water continues to trickle down from the expansive sky taking in and releasing all old thoughts stories and beliefs that might continue to arise breathe through an open heart as you allow whatever arises to be cleansed if fearful worried or judgmental thoughts arise about this process of release or about your intent to let go simply observe these thoughts as their own life forms too and remind yourself that they are separate from who you really are they do not belong to you and they no longer serve you just open your heart to freedom to release and personal growth compassionately inviting the old to be returned to the earth for processing and renewal if physical tension or discomfort arises within the body observe that too and then gently guide the tense energy towards the surface of the body as the rain trickles down witness it carrying away any and/or discomfort that may have been lodged away in the muscles and cells there is no need to carry this tension any longer continue to ground yourself through the sound of the falling rain allowing it to be your anchor into the present moment while keeping the breath deep draw your awareness to the heart space filling it with love and ease on each inhalation and freeing it of all tension stress and concern on each exhalation through your exhalations offer up all remaining tension to be cleansed by the rain perhaps sighing deeply as you feel into this process of letting go your entire being may now be much lighter and at once was your heart rate has slowed and your breathing has taken on a deep and steady rhythm just allow the breath to rock you gently as the rain continues to trickle down though the rain continues it finds less and less stress and discomfort needing to be cleansed away you are now moving towards a state of deep peace and relaxation completely free of everything that once weighed you down now gently let go of any remaining visuals in your mind's eye allowing the image of you being bathed by the rain to slowly melt away in its place with eyes remaining closed tuned into the space around you once again observe the feel of the surfaces beneath you and around you and then connect to the air as it brushes against your skin and as it fills your lungs continue to breathe slowly and deeply as you continue to hold your awareness on this state of complete ease and relaxation there is nothing left for you to do to open your heart and surrender your mind to a deep and restorative sleep very soon your mindful awareness will melt away into a deep and peaceful slumber till then continue to witness the breath coming and going like waves ABing and flowing Oh being and flowing you

stress and anxiety allowing the body and mind to rest with ease throughout the night this visualization will take you on a magical inner forest journey where you will encounter various creatures along the way that will guide you further along the path towards release peace and tranquillity all that is required of you is your innate capacity for openness so gently allow the body and mind to soften as we begin this journey before you release yourself from what's being carried on throughout today just take a moment now to get comfortable adjust yourself as necessary you might want to use further cushions or blankets or get your pillow exactly as you would like [Music] and just allow the body to softly relax taking a moment to feel into the physical environment you find yourself in keeping your eyes closed allow your body to revel in the physical world around you taking pause here to give gratitude to this very moment where you find yourself currently in so I invite you now to bring your awareness to your breath simply by observing it the breath draws our attention to the present moment and is within this present moment that everything else naturally falls away allow your breath to be your anchor guiding you through the silent gaps between the visualizations of this meditation [Music] follow your breath sound natural rhythm watching it naturally deepen as you draw your attention to it there is no breathing technique required here only an honest and open witnessing as you watch the breath allow any thoughts or judgments to fall away it is not necessary for anything within your experience to look or feel a certain way simply begin to open your heart to the simplicity and perfection of this very moment allowing yourself to be exactly as you are right now also keep in mind that with the all meditations you are always in control the power to visualize to manifest and to embody is yours and yours alone so allow now the energy of the forest to simply guide you into deeper knowings that already exists within you know that whatever sensations feelings or thoughts that may arise are entirely natural you simply witness them before allowing them to pass drawing yourself further into the enchanted forest you are about to discover so just take a few more fully aware breaths preparing the body for deep rest and relief of all stress tension and anxiety as the mind and body softens further into a state of tranquility slowly allow visions of a dense forest to grow within your mind's eye at the foot of this dream the richness of complex soil systems form the ground beneath you and out of this magical earth sprouts elaborate greenery trees shrubs flowers and vines allow the wildness of this forest to grow and then eventually steady out drawing you into the lush beauty and complete stillness of the forest take a few deep breaths here allowing the forest air to fill the entirety of your lungs [Music] with each inhalation notice yourself becoming infused with nature's healing powers and with each breath out witness yourself releasing some sensations of stress or tension into the healing air around you binding yourself now standing or sitting within an opening in these woods continue to take slow and deep breaths here allowing yourself to be in the majesty of the forest you are entirely safe and supported within these woods knowing that nothing here can harm you you open yourself up quite naturally to the messages that come your way in the stillness of this moment this deep forest within you hear a gentle stirring in the dense woods before you slowly and with grace a deer emerges into the opening you resting she is gentle and soft footed presenting no threat to your well-being the two of you watch one another with an incredible openness that permeates the core your being rehearsed soft movements you begin to see that she is here to bestow her wisdom upon you the gift of softness kindness and grace [Music] this deer grants you the ability to harness your intuitive capabilities within this reawakening of intuition you know it is a safe place to gently release the entanglements of the mind that may be fogging over your clearest visions you might like to take a few deep breaths here allowing the mind to be released on each exhalation the deer departs lowly and you were left with her softness and the trace of her silent footing you begin to breathe more deeply and the mind begins to loosen its grasp all of the breath here for a few moments allowing it to carry you deep into the richness of this present moment with each inhalation you are nourished and with each exhalation you are freed from the confines of the mind you rest once more in the peaceful opening of the woods this time an animal makes itself seen not from its footing on the earth floor but rather as it soars above the dense canopy the eagle flies overhead with strength courage and clear-sightedness you watch in awe as it flies between earth and the cosmos as if it were the king of this forest or the king of the open air the Eagle comes as a messenger to reveal a human connection to the divine by way of its appearance here it bestows upon you the gift of power of healing and of wisdom you begin to feel divinely connected to the forest to these animals and to the energy that swirls around you to spirit or to the universe knowing that you are supported by something higher than yourself you begin to release further into this present moment stress or anxiety carried in the body or mind continue to melt away you come the sense that within the grand scheme of the universe the tension that you carry no longer serves you you release it gently into the air with each out breath as the eagle slowly disappears from sight you are left with an awareness of this magical connection between body mind and spirit so in this moment continue to breathe mindfully you draw yourself again and again breath by breath into this present moment within the space of this forest you continue to breathe in the healing air releasing that which no longer serves you to the woods to be transformed you find yourself resting more comfortably and with greater ease in this present moment [Music] your connection to the forest is deepening as you become more settled within its environment you feel inspired by the animals and greenery that nourishes you here and you are fully open to whatever may come knowing that nothing can harm you in any way just before you an agile Lynx emerges from the woods she's quiet and contemplative and she watches you with knowing eyes the Lynx has incredible insights and strong intuition his highly instinctive encourages you to trust your own instincts in the same way she bears the gift of solitude of patience and of caution the Lynx remind you that there is nothing to be done in this instant all that she asks is for you to pay attention with discernment slowly your path unfolds itself with her grace you'll gently be guided along the way or that you are required to do now in this moment is to relax and listen as she disappears into the density of the forest the Lynx leaves you in solitude the air is quiet now and you are beginning to revel in the stillness and silence that is within you as you tune in now gently following your breath you come into contact with the joy and freedom within this very moment as you gently follow your breath you come into contact with this very moment what emotions do you feel here you might feel joy you might feel sadness you might not feel anything and this is all perfectly okay at this moment just allow the outside world to melt away as you experience a deeper sense of peace within sink into this moment a little bit further using your breath to continually ground you in this present moment remind yourself that with each inhalation you are deeply nourished and with each exhalation you softly unnaturally release any stress or tension [Music] as the light begins to fall away behind the trees a calming energy comes over the forest within the center of it you feel yourself to be quiet at home connected deeply with everything that it holds before the light fades away you catch sight of something moving delicately and gently through the air above the most vibrant butterfly you of ever witnessed litters there is dancing peacefully and radiantly through the air around her a complete embodiment of her own radiance she carries the message of joy lightness and transformation the butterfly is not always been this way before opening her wings she spent a period of time within a hardened shell during this period of non movement she transformed bringing her to a place where she is now littering through the lush forest very much alive as the night falls the butterfly leaves you with the feeling of inspiration and a growing faith in the unfolding journey held within the innate wisdom of this ever-changing journey you soften ever more deeply into the unknown see if you can allow all stress and tension to melt away just trusting in this moment a natural flow of the universe light turns to darkness and still you stay there within this forest you are at peace here Elden nourished by the free air around you as you breathe you begin to release any tension that might be still tucked away within this body now lying comfortably on the forest floor you scan the body gently allowing any sensation of discomfort to naturally dissipate see if you can witness all of your stress and anxiety melting away into the ground beneath you you are at one at peace in this moment with the natural flow of the world around you Eldar nourished within the opening of the forest you are gently rocked to sleep the wind caresses your skin and continues to breathe itself through you the air is warm on this summer night and your body is completely at ease you notice the faintest sounds of the forest as they lull you to sleep [Music] before fading into a peaceful slumber you hear a wolf howling in the distance there is no fear within you at hearing this sound rather you feel a divine connection to this Wolf's voice you know deep down that this wolf will not harm you and that it is here to guide you his sound calls to you to remind you that you were divinely connected and supported he is a symbol of guardianship loyalty and courage highly instinctive creatures woofs rely on their own inner knowing and this too is the gift they provide you the wolf's voice appears now to remind you to trust your own inner workings to follow your heart and trust your gut is how radiates through your being as you begin to embody greater courage trust and strength unfolding subtly moment to moment breath by breath embodying this wisdom you allow yourself to sink all the way into this present moment you release every ounce of stress and tension allowing the wisdom of your body to carry you into a deeply healing and restorative sleep you know intuitively that there is nothing to be done in this moment and nothing to be achieved continue to follow the breath you sink deeper and deeper into this body nothing else matters nothing else pulls you in any direction the breath gently carries you into sleep as your mind drifts away you are at peace beginning to take comfort in your sleep letting go letting go [Music] [Music] [Music]
1 hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to visualize your highest self as well as the dreams and goals of your highest intent as you listen to this meditation each night over the course of the next 28 days profound inner shifts and changes will take place this meditation holds the power to change your life helping you to establish new ideas and beliefs about who you really are so I invite you to open your heart to this journey as you move down the path towards your highest self before we begin I invite you to silence all device notifications and set any morning alarms that are required ensure that the blinds are drawn and that all other end of day activities are taken care of and bring yourself into a comfortable lying down position and allow your entire body to just let go and sink into the surface beneath you you might like to make any final movements or adjustments necessary to bring complete comfort to your physical body take a few deep breaths in and out as you settled into this space I invite you now to quietly explore the silent space within by drawing your awareness to your breathing follow its movement into the body and then back out as habitual thoughts begin to loosen their grip just follow the simplicity of the breathing this energetic life force that functions continuously without your need to control it there is nothing you need to consciously do in order to breathe it is a force that effortlessly guides itself by drawing our attention to it we begin to refocus the mind on the present moment using the breath as an anchor to draw us into the ever unfolding reality of right now expand now your field of awareness by observing your connection to the physical world beneath you witness the entire body being warmly held by the earth as you rest here in complete stillness as night falls the earth offers us a chance to release everything the day has required of us inviting us to sink into a period of restoration and rejuvenation as you become aware of the environment through your sense of touch you begin to feel more deeply rooted and connected to this human life allow yourself this moment of peace by feeling into the blessing and benefits of the Setting Sun and the stillness and stability of the earth beneath you in this very moment [Music] the moment we are born into this human form we begin to accumulate ideas about who we are and what we are capable of these ideas turn into beliefs which turn into actions that create our reality however the truth of the matter is that we are not whatever our thoughts have limited us to be when we start to unravel a complex web of stories we have told ourselves again and again we free up space for our truest and highest self to shine through if the mind attempts to analyze or rationalize your stories I invite you to gently let go of this mental action as you move into the heart space old beliefs will naturally begin to unravel themselves exposing what exists deep beneath the surface of who you think you are so draw your breath into the heart now each time limiting thoughts arise about who you are where you have been or where you are going gently guide these notions down to the heart to be transformed as you witness them arising silently repeat these thoughts I see you and I release you I see you and I release you I see you and I release you each time you release preconceived notions about who you are you free up empty space for new life to emerge from without seeding any new ideas just yet take some time to simply revel in the silence and the emptiness of the world within and it's a soothing emptiness that grows more apparent as each limiting notion of who you are untangles itself from your core [Music] draw your awareness to your stomach noticing the way the breath causes your belly to rise and to fall on the breath out alongside each full breath cycle continue to ground yourself in this moment through the breath allowing it to remind you of what is most real that is your direct experience of this present moment now as you breathe focus your attention on the following words helping you to deeply reaffirm the belief that you are far more than any limiting self notions and that you are capable of achieving your truest dreams and goals so alongside each breath silently whisper to yourself I create my life from within I create my life from within I create my life from within take a few moments of silence now to sink deeply into the truth of these words repeating them softly and slowly begin to notice your entire body becoming more relaxed and then draw your awareness to your toes very slowly begin to carry your attention upwards throughout the body and as you pass each area of your physical being observe any areas where they may be lingering tension or tightness and silently whisper I see you and I release you to each area that requires your loving attention once you have reached the top of your head bring the entire physical body into your awareness the mind included once again quietly compassionately and non-judgmentally repeat these words I see you and I release you I see you and I release you I see you and I release you a deep sense of lightness and freedom will begin to overcome you just take a few deep breaths into this sensation allowing it to run through your entire being now with your highest self quietly radiating outwards I invite you to begin to consider what new version of yourself is waiting to emerge what dreams or goals are ready to be brought to fruition take a few moments of silence here as you allow images and dreams to come to you there is no need to actively seek anything out there is also no right or wrong ideas that might come to the surface simply allow your heart to speak allowing its purest and highest intent to come to your awareness through words and images observe them as they arise [Music] also becoming aware of any attempt the mind might make to intervene refrain from making plans from assessing plausibility from arguing or judging what arises just allow yourself to unconditionally explore whatever comes up for you now begin to visualize yourself in a small stretch of open space in the middle of a forest observe the wildlife that flourishes around you observe the colors the textures the sounds and the aromas open all of your senses to this space feeling into the wild freedom of this natural landscape [Music] you standing firmly rooted into the earth you reach into your pocket and pull out three seeds just take a moment to observe these seeds noting how miraculous seeds really are these tiny nuggets of material hold the power and incredible potential to transform into something completely different than what they might appear to be in their present form and you too have seeds inside of you that are waiting to be planted so take a moment to bring to mind three intentions of your highest self of your purest heart consider the words and images that came to you in the silent and spacious void created after limiting thoughts and beliefs had been released what are your highest goals who are you ready to become now with the first intention in mind silently whisper your vision to one of your seeds take a moment to thoughtfully plant this intention into the seed and then as you bend down dig a small hole with your bare hands once you have prepared the soil for your first seed place the seed in the space created and gently cover it up with the fertile earth take a moment to bless this seed offering it the energy it needs to blossom into full potential and then come to rest in silence once again in this opening in the forest draw your second intention to mind and bestow it upon your second seed crouching down once again create a space in the earth for your seed to grow roots plant the seed and then cover it with soil offer this newly planted intention all of the love and support it will need to grow into fruition and then return to silent awareness of the enchanted forest you are Hin finally observe the third seed resting in the palm of your hand and whisper your third and final intention or dream to it [Music] breathe through the heart as you bless this seed with unconditional love and then as you did for the rest dig a small hole in the earth and then plant your seed as you cover the hole up with rich soil observe a lightness coming over your entire being your dreams have now been seeded so take a few final moments to send positive vibrations to the earth and the seeds that are planted there knowing that change is happening in this very moment witness the body relaxing and the breath deepening as a subtle transformation frees you of whatever once held you back now gently release the image of yourself in this fertile forest knowing that you will come back here again and again night after night to plant these energetic seeds of your highest intention keep these intentions in mind for replanting but also allow flexibility in your intentions as complex human beings we are multifaceted creatures with numerous ways of expressing ourselves and of living our lives the ways in which you can live wholeheartedly are boundless the possibilities are infinite return to your breath allowing its steady and subtle rhythm to carry you into a state of deep relaxation there is nothing left for you to do nothing for you to visualize so allow all thoughts to melt away surrender your dreams to the world around you knowing that the universe has already heard your calls your highest self is in the making and as you come into sleep transformation will continue to unfold focus your attention on your breath as you fall asleep or you may alternatively choose to reaffirm the truth that the power to recreate yourself and your life exists inside of you quietly repeat I create my life from within I create my life from within I create my life from within surrender to the universes mysterious process and wisdom knowing that you are unconditionally supported loved and held in this very moment a new you is being birthed right now
1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this sleep meditation hypnosis over the course of the next few minutes we will journey through four different environments exploring peace and relaxation in the context of each one of them at the end you will have the freedom to select the right one for you attuning your spiritual surroundings to what you need for health healing and your happiness with this in mind allow a calm sense of expectation to rise in your mind and set an intention to rest deeply and completely feel your body relaxed more than it has in a long while all the tension in your body dissolving bit by bit let every muscle in your body relax even those in the place you normally hold tired this may be your forehead your lips or jaw the back of your head your shoulder blades your lower back your belly your knees or ankles and right down to the tendons in your feet feel your whole body melt into wherever you rest and allow the surface around you to support your body let's begin our meditation so lying down keeping your back straight as much as you can feel your body becoming more serene you are still and peaceful in this breath and the next as you relax you begin to hear the crash of water in the distance as you sink a little deeper into relaxation it grows louder until you yourself are standing on the banks of an enormous waterfall it is morning and the sunlight catches the water as it falls creating thousands of tiny rainbows in the spray around the cliff the rumble of moving water is at once both soothing and awe-inspiring a symphony of Earth's very essence tumbling around you take a moment to breathe in this majesty [Music] [Music] as you look more closely at the waterfall bill the cool mist envelop your face leaving dewy droplets on your cheeks and Florida feel the vitality and power of this place all around you in the warmth of the cliff bases the gentle glow of the Sun the frothy water around the Falls notice yourself becoming karma beginning to let go of your worries and physical tension allow yourself to breathe letting the rush of the water guide you into a deeper relaxation allow yourself to feel the slow transitions from inhale to exhale and from exhale to inhale note the tiny delicate paws in the center of these transitions that space where inhalation ends but before exhalation begins breathe as deeply or as shallowly as comfortable for you your chest moving rhythmically and effortlessly as you sink a little deeper into relaxation letting go of any worry or stress if at any time your mind wanders simply bring it gently back to your breath a calming gentle process of bringing air into your lungs feel any tension in your body lift away with every breath you take nothing can hurt you here enjoy these next few moments next to the waterfall letting your worries dissolve under the relentless rumble of fresh rainwater [Music] [Music] as you notice the sounds of the meditation begin to change allow your imagination to follow your feelings to follow creating around you a magnificent sandy beach waves break in crystalline sprays and the call of seagulls eases your mind smell the sharp tang of salt and the warm dustiness of hot sand let your shoulders droop and your fora done crease in the background you can hear the wash of the ocean waves breaking on the beach you can watch the water if you like or close your imaginary eyes and simply dwell in the presence of your other senses breathe and listen let everything else go so much of meditation is the practice of letting go of accepting that you cannot control everything around you of welcoming in the infinite glorious possibilities and opportunities that are waiting for you letting go of your conscious discipline your task oriented nature is the gateway to relaxation so taking a breath in and exhale letting go of the need to control your experience just for a few minutes allow yourself to feel whatever arises letting go of everything negative and treasuring the beauty of this moment's experience as your body lets go of any tension your breath slows down and it may deepen just a slight bit simply follow its rhythm listening to the quiet in and out of air in your lungs if you would like match your breath to the tempo of the sea nearby following the rise and fall of the waves behind whatever feels most comfortable most relaxing and embrace it this is your chance to discover and choose whatever you need to rest most fully and again as the music and sounds of this meditation begin to change allow yourself to be transported to the banks of a freshwater brook or river where fish jump and the sunlight glints on the wet rocks as you take a deep inhale you breathe in the burbling sound of water on stones and the gentle sigh of wind in the young tree boughs take another deep breath and then release it relishing the warmth of the air that leaves your body feel your feet sink into the soft grass of the riverbank and notice the bright green color of early spring if you would like you may dip your foot into the stream noticing the way the water washes over your toes cooling your skin you can hear a few honeybees buzzing about enjoying the landscape as much as you are you know that the bees will not harm you and so you can continue to enjoy the gentle harmony they make a soft sound that sets off the silver tinkling music of the creek a little way in front of you a butterfly flutters on the breeze dipping and soaring with the invisible current of the wind you hold out your hand and it floats closer to you landing on your skin with an almost imperceptible touch allow yourself to lay down on the riverbanks feeling the way the grass molds around your body supporting your back and neck so you can relax more completely above you you can see a fluffy white cloud a clear blue sky all around you are the sounds of nature peaceful and rhythmic your thoughts disappeared replaced by this music of nature you can feel all the aches and pains in your body dissolve away as you sink a little deeper into the warm grass relaxed and at peace in this beautiful landscape give yourself permission to enjoy it as you breathe you feel yourself growing lighter more relaxed almost as if the stresses and tensions of the day are being washed away in the cheerful sound of the river breathe in welcoming inspiration and peace breathe out exhaling worry and fear this is your time embrace it now in these next few moments and now as the music and sounds around you change one small breathe in and find yourself on the path of a majestic and ancient forest the trail through the forest is verdant lined with the carpet of the grass your feet sink into it's slightly brushing against the soft coolness of its surface birds sing in the trees a symphony of natural beauty some chirp back and forth others trill melodies into the wind a gentle breeze sways in the trees and the soft touch of its passing soothes your skin the sunshine is less bright here dappled and soft instead of its usual brash gold the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to and yet it is a soothing coolness filled with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss [Music] [Music] as you walk further and deeper into the forest the trees become larger their trunks wider and spaced further apart in the resulting space hangs a mantle of pearly fog floating a few feet above the ground as you walk your legs stir the fog and it swirls around you gauzy tendrils lazy soft against your skin birdsong accompanies you along your journey lifting your spirit and soothing your body with its innocent sounds let your self marvel at the size of these trees as wide around as dining tables and almost taller than your eyes can see smell the dampness of believes and dirt underneath them nourishing and protecting their roots imagine how far these tree's roots must extend into the earth in order to remain sturdy and upright above all allow the nature's music to guide you into further relaxation as you breathe deeply watching the sunlight meander back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze bring your attention to yourself are you holding any tension or is there any pain in your body are you carrying or holding on to something in your back your neck or your shoulders is there tension in your hips or perhaps the way you squeeze your eyelid shut how does it feel to be you right now you are still and tranquil United with this peaceful an ageless environment feel your body relaxing as you breathe a little deeper letting go of anything that might distract you let yourself focus completely on the beauty of the forest sense it feel what it's like welcoming the harmony and stillness that accompanies it [Music] allow your attention to travel across your body noticing how deeply your muscles and tendons have relaxed since now the space between your thoughts the ease with which your mind moves between thoughts never lingering too long on one subject you feel calm peaceful and daddy's now in this state of quiet peace as this meditation spoken part comes to an end allow your mind to return to that place savoring the beautiful details as you sink further into this state of happy equanimity let your breath guide you and enjoy the final moments of music as you drift off into a deep and peaceful sleep rest well my friend rest well you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music]

welcome a sense of relaxation and peace into your mind and body let relaxation and sleep come to you easily welcoming a slowing down of the momentum of your energy to gradually find stillness tonight begin with your eyes open and although it is likely dark in your room roll your eyes up as if you are looking into your own eyebrows keep your eyes up and take a deep breath in and out again breathe in and know that every time you blink this is a sign that deep sleep is coming to you and one more time deep breath in and as you breathe out let your eyelids close since any fluttering movement occurring in your eyes this movement is a relaxed state of awareness coming to you a state of internal awareness where your healing powers are increased the state will lead you into deep uninterrupted healing sleep notice the heaviness of your eyelids as you relax the muscles around your eyes your face and neck are so relaxed that you couldn't even tense your muscles if you tried you may even feel as if your eyelids have been glued shut or locked together and it feels great to have them closed they are feeling like they really don't want to open you'll find that when you try to open them they feel locked together you notice the fluttering of your eyes once more and you go deeper into relaxation you'll find the harder you try to open them the more they feel heavy and you feel drowsy and you go deeper you are surrendering into your drowsiness and falling into the warm embrace of sleep without resistance and now forget all about your eyes and just go deeper relax deeper drift deeper already your cares and tensions are just fading away you're relaxing more and more with each sound that you hear allow a drifting floating feeling to develop throughout your entire body no need to try to make it happen simply allow this enjoyable floating feeling to develop with every breath you take let relaxation come to you wash over you with each and every natural breath you take as you continue to drift into relaxation let your attention move to notice the weight of your body sinking into the surface below you feel yourself softening and letting go deeper into relaxation deeper into the surface beneath you as your perceived boundaries are falling away the boundaries that appear to separate your body from the space around it are disintegrating as you take in a deep breath of air merging what is inside of you with what is outside of you take in another deep breath hold it for a moment if you can and then breathe out slowly letting go letting go letting go do this again take a deep full breath in hold for a moment and breathe out as slowly as you can and one more time breathe in hold and let it all go now allow your breath to relax and therefore your mind and body will do

1 [Music] [Laughter] below and welcome my friends my name is Jason Stevenson and thank you for joining me on this sleep meditation golden stars astral heights meditation this meditation is unlike any other meditation I have previously done as this meditation is being guided with the help of my guided spiritual adviser David [Music] so I asked you to find a comfortable position lying down preferably with your back straight wriggling around finding yourself finding that space where you can lay comfortably and breathe with ease begin the meditation by taking in three deep breaths in through the nose sending that breath all the way down to the lower belly area and releasing letting go just do this a few more times and when you are done returning your breathing back to a comfortable rhythm that is natural for you I need to try to change it just be with your breath enjoy the sensation of that breath as it passes through your nostrils sending it down and feeling it as it releases through your nostrils once more if at any time during this meditation your thoughts wander away from my voice you simply just have to acknowledge that thought and your job is simply to bring your focus back to your breathing in and out this meditation does not have to be complex in any way our job is simply to allow our mind to fall away to give it rest for the day whilst we allow our heart and spirit to open and surrender [Music] so for these next few moments simply being with your breath you may feel your stomach rising and falling maybe the sides of your belly rising and falling or your lower back area expanding on the breath in contracting on the breath out [Music] really connect with your breathing just be here and enjoy this process and I will return in a few moments time [Music] I would like you now to visualize a golden light that is pouring in from the top of your head and it's beginning to fill you and pour all the way down your entire body it's a shining golden light and as it pours in it soothes you calms your mind and relaxes you feel it as it travels down your face relaxing your facial muscles your eyebrows your forward nose and cheeks and your eyes and eye sockets just allowing them to feel heavy and relaxed down into your throat and your shoulders and now filling your arms down to your elbows your forearms wrists and right down to your hands and fingertips you may even feel a tingling sensation within your fingers and if you do just allow that to be you don't have to judge that or try to name that just accept that as it is and coming back up your harms your shoulders and down now that the golden light continues to spill down to your chest area your stomach and your shoulder blades and your spine running down your spinal cord releasing all tension and allowing you to relax deeply [Music] the golden light is continuing to pour in and runs down now to your pelvis area your groin your buttocks just allowing it to soften and relax no tension and your thighs the tops of your thighs the backs of your thighs your knees behind your knees and down your calf muscles your shins and pouring down into your feet soles of your feet the bridge of your feet right down into the very tips of each toe filling them up one by one and this light begins to fill your entire body now it's moving up and back up your feet your shins your calf muscles billing your body soothing your body relaxing your body getting ready for the most wonderful journey you're about to embark on moving up now to your knees the backs of your knees your thighs your pelvis your groin buttocks up to your stomach area your lower back feeling at all let go if there are any knots within your stomach feeling them loosen and untie moving up to your chest and your shoulders and seeing from your fingertips your wrists elbows upper arms filled with this golden light moving up to your throat and your face your neck and right along your back your back softening lengthening and right up to the tip of your head beginning to overflow now this golden light [Music] keep breathing keep breathing vo this overflow now begin to pour outside of your body encompassing your entire body nikka of gold and sparkling light refracting all shades of gold and sparkles of gold beginning to drip down onto your bed showering down [Music] helping you to release everything from your mind to empty your mind to unlearn what you've learned today to forgive any grudges or resentments of health today to release them because just right now they don't serve you and we're here to serve you but like you now to visualize there's gold and light beginning to pulse through your body from the top of your head in waves right down to the tips of your toes feel it vibrating pulsing through and this golden light pulsing now delivering an energy a healing energy a positive energy there's going to be with you for this meditation to heal you on many forms emotionally mentally physically giving you what you need for these next few moments [Music] [Music] this vibration now begins to quicken and as it gets faster begins to pause through your body at a faster rate you begin to feel lighter and lighter almost like you are lifting off your bed beginning to rise above your bed and you are so be it you are you continue to rise above your bed and even if you look back for a moment you can see that you are there your body is there lying down now over you your eternal spirit it's beginning to rise further and further up and away from your body you are safe in this zone because you are simply loved you begin now to pass through the roof of where you once were passing through with ease with grace you keep moving up and up further enjoying the floating feeling of being free from all worries concerns and restrictions of the physical body your mind is free you're moving up into an amazing astral plane where you can look back and begin to see not only your house but the community that you live in the lights below twinkling looking oh so peaceful and you continue to rise rising above looking back down seeing cities seeing countryside's seeing your entire country and the waters surrounding your country moving out into another expanse reaching another plane a plane of space a plane of nothingness and yet everything loading drifting you are like a golden ball of vibrating energy showering from you sparks of love harmony and peace falling away going back to the earth as you continue to rise moving up now you begin to see the curvature of the world of the earth how beautiful it looks from here and from here realizing that your troubles and concerns that you may have had seemed oh so trivial now almost non-existent you simply continue to float to drift into this ever expansive consciousness a space that is set aside for you a space where you are connected to all that is and all that ever was [Music] [Music] here you have time to reflect on what really is important in your life and an answer that keeps calling to you over and over again is love love for who you are love your family love your friends and love and the God sauce that is within you and without guiding you protecting you and keeping you safe what you are now is true human spirit and a mass of potential you are vibrating at a light frequency it

healing and eternal consciousness when you consider any worries that you may have had that you have been carrying around with you you allow them now to completely fall away from you in this etheric body you're now in any thoughts of worries or concerns simply not important and not relevant on this plane if you've had any health issues right where you are now in this existence you are pure 100%

of amazing energy and connection and you continue to float up even further now and as you begin to get higher you realize there's an opening and in that opening it's pure white light shining through and this opening this white light opening is calling you and there is no fear connected to this only a sense of belonging of love gratitude and harmony connection to all that is so you begin to float

city's expansive spaces of darkness where the ocean lies so much beauty there looking forward to the return to be the new you that you are each day you were born again to create the life that you

[Music] he may begin to make out shapes of where you live your community your city or country shifting down and from where you are now looking down on your house beginning to just gently slow down and with ease you just appear to slip through the roof you've had any worry or concern back into the room where you began this meditation back on to the bed you were on or the floor reconnecting to your body sensing your body you may like to wiggle your fingers and toes to bring you back in this moment reconnecting to your breath to your breathing breathing in and out breathing in and out breathing

1 grounding meditation hello and welcome to this guided meditation my name is Jason Stevenson and over the course of the next 30 minutes or so we will find stability and groundedness returning from whatever thoughts hopes and worries phoebus from feeling in the present moment you might choose to listen to this meditation before bed right when you wake up in the morning or as a break in an otherwise really busy day however you choose to approach this recording is absolutely right for you just allow your eyes to close your breathing to deepen and your body to relax make sure you're in a comfortable position where you won't be disturbed for the next 30 minutes or so and taking three deep breaths to begin with breathing all the way and sending that breath all the way down to your diaphragm area holding for a few seconds and then letting it all come out release all your hair and do this another two times as you breathe a little deeper imagine now that you were standing in a grassy field tiny green plants sparkling with Jun cushioning your feet with their soft leaves and above you the sky is spotless blue and you can hear a few birds singing around you it is morning and it's the start of a beautiful day as you stand in this place allow yourself to truly feel all that is around you [Music] notice the temperature of the air on any exposed skin the sunshine or wind against your body [Music] take note of the smells damp soil dewy leaves [Music] can you hear any birds possibly crickets or perhaps honeybees [Music] gaze into the distance allowing your imagination to sharpen the scenery around you into an intensely detailed beautiful landscape and then when you are ready allow yourself to feel what it is like within your own body at this very moment where do your muscles and tendons hold pain or tension do you hold your face taut or your shoulders slumped I'd like you to take these few moments and truly notice how you feel treating yourself with kindness not not trying to change anything this is a snapshot of you a portrait captured in this moment just give yourself permission to become familiar with it [Music] and now as you become attune to your body allow your consciousness to turn to your mind as best as you are able allowing yourself to observe your brain its thought patterns and impulses without actively participating in them [Music] it's almost like you are viewing a sporting match or a television show you can see what is happening you can point things out or cheer on certain thoughts but you have no need to change or influence though at this moment you're simply watching the move past in whatever shapes or patterns they happen to take on [Music] if you find yourself getting sucked into a particular dilemma or worry simply exhale blow it out and bring your consciousness back to spectating observing as you observe your thoughts you will notice that certain hopes reminders and even worries continue to appear some may tempt you more than others some may be easier to let go of pay attention to the persistent ones and if they appear again ask yourself if these thoughts manifest themselves in your body you may notice anger in your chest or stress your hips but no matter how these emotions present themselves take heed oftentimes almost chronic pain is nothing more than a learned response to a series of emotions take these few moments now and simply stay with what you are feeling allowing yourself to be conscious of the way it affects your mind and physical body [Music] when you were ready taking a deep breath and exhale sighing out all the frustration tension and destructiveness within you do not be afraid to make a sound simply allow your exhale to wash it out of you cleansing your body in mind like a warm healing wave I'd like you to do this five more times noticing how you become progressively more relaxed increasingly more relieved with each passing moment feeling yourself becoming present anchored in the gentle endless rhythm of your own respiration and now as you stand in this lush green field imagine that your feet are growing roots majestic powerful roots that grow into the soil holding you Ferland strong in this idyllic place see these roots going down as they reach further into the ground they split off forming a vast network of tendrils that will hold you firm in even the greatest weeds roots that will nourish and protect you through even the darkest winters and stronger storms [Music] these roots extend hundreds of feet into the dirt growing around rocks and boulders passing through soil that has not seen the Sun for many centuries they cross the paths of other tree's roots touching them gently in greedy growing together yet respecting each trees individual space and root paths you are rooted in the most beautiful place your face turned toward the warm Sun and your roots nestled in cool rich soil and now as you take your next breath in imagine that your legs and torso are being wrapped gently in bark a soft form-fitting covering that will protect you from all the hazards that life has to offer you you know that you may return to your human form whenever you would like and so this is a soothing process almost as if you were being draped in the softest blanket imaginable you wiggle your toes peeling your roots bar below ground nestling into the dirt you shrug your shoulders feeling the comfortable durability of bark all around you you have walked this earth for many years experiencing the joys and challenges that each day has to bring you you have earned your bark the golden cloak shot through with silver that warms you every day of your life breathe a little deeper and listen to the sounds of birds and nature all around you you stretch your arms out and as you do they fan into branches branches white with a spring whiteness of apple blossoms this time in your life is busy stressful even but in this space you are able to reach for the heavens celebrating the joy and space in every present moment as you inhale notice the delicate aroma of the small white flowers [Music] breathe in the smell of sunshine and soil and growth and when you are ready turn your head to take in the sights all around you as you look around you realize that you are not standing in a field you are standing in an orchard a nearly endless community of trees right with the hopeful flowers of spring around your trunks long green grass grows a rock bright and in your branches bluebirds see you are not the only tree you are a part of a community a beautiful and vibrant orchard that grows together so often our lives feel as if they are only about us moments of pain and suffering of a distancing from that which matters most of us can be excruciating and yet even these sensations are a part of the rhythm of the seasons of the processes each of us undergoes many times throughout our lives [Music] we each have periods of flowering of new leaves and possibilities for the future [Music] we have the strong green growth of summer when small apples begin to appear between our bridges and our lives become glossy with gentle rains there is the abundance of fall when our plans and dreams become fruitful the air sweet with the crispness of ripe fruit but there are other times too there is the time when we drop our leaves letting our branches become bare falling into restful silent dormancy [Music] there are the times when the orchard keeper comes pointing out to us the branches that have been withered or split the ones that no longer produce leaves or fruit there is the pain of losing these branches the loss of something that was once creative productive beloved but no matter how agonizing this is there is always that time when new shoots appear tiny branches that stand out electric green with life against our silvery gold trunks and so the cycle continues from flower to fruit to rest and back again and through it all we are rooted solid in our roots and our place in the orchard anchored against the coldest snows sharpest rains strongest gales [Music] no matter what happens our roots hold us steady and our fellow trees brave the elements with us take a few minutes now and allow your body and mind to fully drink in the scene around you the beautiful white and gold expanse of the orchard you have been planted in smell the air be all the Sunshine's warm touch let the sounds of birds and animals guide you into a deeper relaxation the combination of wind and soil war and cold motion and stillness lull you into a total and complete serenity we will continue on together in a few minutes you this this right here in this very moment is the sensation of groundedness with each exhale you feel your body and mind relax a little more with every inhale you breathe in a clarity purpose and peace you are rooted and stable yet free able to reach to all the sky and sway in the breeze and perhaps most importantly you are surrounded by others others who love you and respect you and wish to help you you grow together each unique but journeying toward the same balanced peacefulness strong individually as a whole take these last few minutes of meditation to savor it [Music] and coming back now to the room we began this meditation becoming aware of the cells in this room presently surrounding you beginning to wiggle your fingers and toes awakening your body returning to your body stretching out your muscles every muscle every tender and when you were ready you can open your eyes enjoy your day or evening ahead [Music] you
1 [Music] resting and sleep guided meditation welcome and thank you for joining me for this resting and sleep guided meditation my name is Jason and I sincerely hope you enjoy and experience this meditation as a relaxing rejuvenating and comforting time as we start to breathe we will prepare to spend the next 20 30 minutes or so together the purpose of this meditation will be the creation of a time for you to unwind relax and learn some easy technique for having an experience of restful sleep its resting and sleep guided meditation is a time to be still and aware by using the carlo's of your breath to relax your mind joining your breath and mind together as a team you can experience being refreshed and rested for your time of rest before we begin if you allow yourself to drift off to sleep please be sure the joy in a fully safe and comfortable position you may wish to lean back in the chair or lie down if you have enough space and would feel comfortable there be sure to support and protect your head and if you have any eggs or pains or discomforts position your body thoughtfully to maximize your physical relaxation and ease of breathing to take full advantage of your benefits from participating in this meditation please also silence any alarms and ringers and dim the lights and make your space private one so you can focus on complete relaxation and the sound of my voice you will have the familiarity of feeling your body relaxing and unwinding and drifting off to a restful sleep during this meditation allow your eyes to close or your visual focus to soften into a gaze where your eyes are resting unconnected to the actions in your mind [Music] [Music] in your relaxed position allow your breath to calmly slip in and out of your body like the rolling rhythms of sound and light waves the breath washes over you and relaxes you a little deeper with each exhalation breathing isn't easy action the body will even do it on its own if you allow the natural rhythm to guide you in this sleeping guided meditation you'll open your mind as you've opened your breath and allow your mind to have peace and ease unfocused thoughts or ideas may come to you and they may seem urgent or like they require your attention be assured but for the duration of this guided meditation you may let them pass these thoughts and ideas serve as your reminder that you are a vessel you are receptive to the needs of your environment and the needs of your body but also these needs are separate from your consciousness for the duration of our time together the mind and body can relax and together enjoy this peaceful time of resting through mindful guided relaxation you can gain improved wellness improved personal relationships and improved physical stamina [Music] after finding a comfortable position so you can now relax the entire body we will begin by shifting the use of your senses as we focus or softened each of your senses you can allow yourself to use that change to drift toward a more restful and fulfilling sleep for calming your mind and your body in this guided meditation first we let go of the visual use of your eyes our eyes are often overworked and overlooked for care in this world of artificial light [Music] they are forced to work harder when they had tired and they deserve a rejuvenating rest as much as the rest of your body Afiya is a little well-deserved vacation by relaxing them and their focus of interpreting the visual world around you [Music] if you haven't already done so you may wish to close them entirely or simply soften your gaze so that your surroundings melt into the background of your consciousness [Music] disconnecting from our visual sense brings our awareness in focusing on the benefits of rest for the mind and for the body while it is the job of the eyes to look outward in the guided sleep meditations we wish to see and reveal what is within [Music] in the extremities of your body beginning with the hands and the feet unwind yourself settle your hands and feet and softener allow each hand and foot to hang limp from your wrists and ankles in a fully rested and unflexible let them hold no weight and have the sensation of weightlessness as they rest at the end of your limbs next bring your relaxing awareness to the muscles of your arms and lower legs [Music] slackening your calves and forearms unwinding at the wrists and ankles feel a general loosening throughout that first length of your extremities feeling those areas become more and more relaxed melting away like butter in the Sun unhinging softening and unwinding as you move through your body the thighs in your legs and biceps in your arms also begin to melt from contact with this spreading relaxation a calm warmth greets your skin and muscles like the breaking dawn of an open field as the Sun comes overhead the warmth spreads crossing from your limbs into the torso and hips the muscles of your shoulders back chest and waist dissolve any thymus and release any tension as you drift deeper and deeper into a relaxed dreamlike State feel your body now melting slowly melting in the Sun a warm glow supports the relaxing of your back from the base of your spine through your ribs and up into your neck the warmth and golden glow seeps into your muscles and connective tissues unfolding and unwinding and millions of layers of cells that make up your frame and body up your neck into the base of your skull and all around the features of your face a flush of warmth and free sensation unlocks relaxation for the last parts of your skin and body [Music] your nose lips cheeks and mouth are all slacking still and clenched and relaxed even your brain is enveloped by the warmth and almost noticeable golden glowing light of your body dreamlike state [Music] [Music] now that you are in this state of full physical relaxation allow your mind to fully unfold and open like a map of your memories and senses [Music] allow information to pass over the map on the way to some destination as you rest here in another dimension aware of the thoughts but not a part of them [Music] imagine yourself getting farther and farther away from those thoughts so that they are like the people when riding high in the clouds on an aeroplane or as though you were soaring through the sky like a bird your thoughts and memories are still there but you were floating high above soaring in and among the clouds breathing in the fresh and clean [Music] as you journey through the clouds guided by your desire to soak in the rejuvenating and eeling powers of the universe allow yourself to envision those peaceful times of restful sleep in your past and allow yourself to create the fear future your future create empowering and relaxing visions of your future self and will bring about a joy and restful sleep to your life I'll give you some moments now to create these exciting visions of your future self [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] in your journey through the clouds celebrate your ability to write now in this time and space give yourself the gift of healing and restful sleep the journey through the clouds keeps our mind clear and our bodies weightless as we refuel our brain tissues with energy and oxygen oxygen as the giver of life and regulates all our body systems including our ability to enjoy restful sleep [Music] allow this vision was soaring in the clouds and breathing in the crisp clean air inspire you to breathe or feel as in deeply resting and rebuilding your body through mindful meditation and restful sleep it's one of the most natural ways to improve your quality of life [Music] [Music] experience the feeling of safety in this moment experience the effect of unwinding and letting go that this assured safety is on your consciousness [Music] peering down from your restful place in the clouds imagine all the good that restful sleep could also do for others in your life and people all around the world bringing that awareness down from the clouds and into your physical mind start to reconnect to your body in this present time environment bring back with you that awareness of self that awareness of inner peace and the benefits of total relaxation as you reconnect with your body in mind I would like to welcome you back from our journey together and exploring the restful night's sleep and the methods of imagery and breath control you can use these to have better quality restful sleep anytime thank you for joining me on this restful sleep meditation sleep well my friend sleep well [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh well [Music]
1 hello and welcome to this guided meditation relaxation for sleep and healing is Jason Stephenson and in this meditation my aim is to help you achieve a healthier body mind and spirit by you using the power of a focused desire and a deep body relaxation during this meditation I'll ask you to focus on different parts of the body and doing so will take you into a deeper state of being so you can better access your subconscious mind and harness its infinite potential people do not realize their own power fortunately for you you are exactly where you must be to exercise your greatest gifts your will and your imagination so please be comfortable lying on your back and keep your back and spine straight so it will not impede your breathing take a few deep breaths to ground and center yourself you just for the moment let go of any expectations as you lie there simply focus on being as relaxed as comfortable as you possibly can if at any point you fall asleep that's fine your subconscious mind will still be able to receive these instructions to help you bring about a healthier body mind and spirit for you so right now I'd like you to focus your attention at the top of your head bring in and on the breath out allowing any pent-up tension to dissolve allow your phorid to relax letting any tightness there vanish next to your eyelids the fleshy part around your eye sockets your temples the back of your head let go you now your lips release any control you may have over them just let your jaw and the fleshy bit beneath your jaw sag as well as your cheeks and your tongue relax your chin the back and front of your neck the way down to the base of your throat you let that relaxed feeling news further down to your shoulders and your shoulder joints and let ease flow down your spine between your shoulder blades into your armpits and your upper back relax your chest and upper arms all the way to your elbows and let your lower arms go and feel them sink deeply into your bed your wrist both left and right let them go and feel the mass of your hands sink deeper into the bed feel your hands let go the bony back part as well as the soft fleshy inside relax your fingers letting them call as they will and same with your knuckles as well as the space between your fingers and the joints of your fingers allow the sides of your chest sag and your solar plexus area around the bellybutton sink deeper into your body allow this feeling to trickle down your stomach the sides of your stomach and your lower back let go of your hips your thighs your groin and buttocks notice your upper legs the top bottom and the sides go relax your knees and the fleshy part behind your knees and allow that feeling now to extend down to your lower legs your carbs and the bony part of your shins relax your ankles and heels letting them dig deeper into your bed relax your feet the top and also the soft instep beneath feeling is now into the balls of your feet boning knuckles of your feet and the soft flesh between your toes relax your toes all of them the joints of the toes all the way to their padded bottoms and tips now shift your focus back to your feet your ankles legs relax upper legs bucks your thighs and groin make your way up to your stomach and lower back further up to your chest and upper back and we're moving back up to the lower arms upper arms shoulders and shoulder joints moving further up to the throat the neck the back of your neck your facial muscles lips mouth tongue relax your eyes and eyelids moving further up to the forward and the back of your head and finally we're back at the top of your head so I'd like you now to let go and bring your focus back to your breathing and don't try to regulate your breath simply breathe a comfortable way for you and just be just stay with this breath for a few moments and if thoughts come and go at this time allow them to come and go put out the welcome mat for those thoughts and all you need to do is simply to let go of the thought by shifting your focus back to your breathing in and out I'll return in a few moments to take you on to the next stage energy from within today the Sun reminds me that I am made

from to every cell of my healthy body you're now ready for a deep healing and body relaxation like you to focus your attention to the spot between your eyebrows from there move your attention to the center of your throat next to your right shoulder joint but to keep breathing through this shifting your focus to the right elbow joint now your right wrist joint the tip of your right thumb the tip of your right index finger the tip of your right middle finger the tip of your right ring finger of your right pinky finger and move back up to your right wrist joint further up to your right elbow

your chest focus on the right chest to the center of your chest focus on your left area of your chest and return once more to the center of your chest to welcome you may feel a heaviness now and this heaviness is the first stage of an exercise called yoga nidra the midway point between wakefulness and sleep many liken it to floating on a calm peaceful waters and here you are safe ear all tension is gone allowing your body to naturally begin its healing process and is as calm as it can be while still conscious so it's also here that you're at your most powerful because it's in this state that the barriers between your conscious and your subconscious mind are at their weakest so let's begin with you now that's not the you that is lying down and breathing expanding with each in-breath and contracting with each out breath no I'm talking to the you that is listening to these words using this bodies is to pick up vibrations and translate into sound I am talking to the you that is feeling these sensations through this body that senses matter through flesh that detects light through eyes I'm talking to you that is independent of these things that animates these things that affects these things but is unscathed by any of them into the you that remains unchanged through all of the seasons of your life and that remains even when this body is unconscious you the real you you are the powerful being that has chosen to live in this body for the time being the ancient one who has lived many lives through countless eons since time began you are the deathless one who creates worlds and strides the universe delighting in the infinity of space to whom matter and time mean nothing one who animates this body through breath and with the same energy that enlivens the cosmos an actor who enjoys the drama you have written and the character you have chosen to act it out with the one who sees without eyes ears without ears and feels without flesh you the true you not the pretend you lying in deep rest as it breathes in and out you have done a wonderful job this life you have created the scenarios you put it through the things that identifies with Jex it calls its own and the co-actors it interacts with are all masterpieces well done it has been a thrilling roller coaster riot of ups and downs and highs and lows just like breath it rises and falls expands and contracts but can it be even better yes again imagine a healthier body one that's robust energetic and strong one that's more flexible rebounds faster and even more full of life feel that feel how wonderful that feels how magnificent our static body like a child again remember childhood supple brimming with irrepressible energy always up to incredible challenges what exuberance and joy each day is an opportunity to enjoy this young body exploding with happiness at every opportunity to move to test one strength to prove one's fitness to the admiration of one and all and the stamina the endless stamina that allows you to run and jump free of aches and pains save for those that come with the joy of exertion after a laughter filled race with friends after gleefully rushing up that grassy hill wet with Dew from the morning after shrieking with joy while running barefoot through those fragrant flowered fields beneath the Sun the mind of childhood endless questions and awestruck wonder at the creation that you are a part of the creation that you played a vital role in making such a mind forgets nothing but everything is a fantastic enigma there is nothing old and tired nothing humdrum and boring wandah piled upon Wanda and the mind reeling with the delicious hunger to know more of what you have wrought or as your co-creator Carl Sagan once said the cosmos is within us we are made of star stuff we're a wave in the universe to know itself so day by day do just that with your mind you explore what you have wrought with your own imagination and will and what you see you delight in for it is all your creation your days and nights are filled with bliss confident in your own power to shape and reshape your world according to your sense of what is fitting for you this knowledge enlivened jus fills every atom in this your body with love with life with peace and with joy for at peace knowing that every bone every muscle every fiber in every cell of this your body had their own wisdom and power greater than any doctors book of knowledge there is no damage that cannot handle no hurt they cannot take care of no need they cannot provide for because they are completely perfect and whole and nights of filled with bliss you are in your own power to shape and reshape your world according to your sense of what is fitting age and live and you fills every atom in your body with love with life with peace and joy you are therefore at peace everyone in your life is there because you have chosen them to be there they are co actors in this drama you have all co-written those who play the antagonist to your character have their role once their purpose has been achieved they will leave your stage to play another role on someone else's call is yours and yours only already know this don't you you were there for at peace knowing that everything in your life is there because you have chosen to have them there they are props that help you play your role to the fullest and when you have no more need of them they must go for that which you have no more need for cannot become and when you desire something it too must come because you know it must you desire it must become the you are a creator and that is why you are a responsible creator careful about what enters the stage of your life and what doesn't what is best for your body your mind your universe and your spirit uncreate that which no longer serves that this drama may continue with love and joy rest well my friend now I am free this body is a beloved temple of my body with each step Hope Springs from every

1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this chakra balancing meditation that it's aim is to help to bring harmony to your chakras cleansing your aura and guiding you into a deep restorative sleep before we begin I'd like to give you a little bit of a background on the nature of the chakras within the body there are seven main chakras that line the spine we can imagine these chakras as spinning vortexes of energy unseen to the eye they underlie whatever our current experience may be each chakra corresponds to specific organs feelings and behaviors this healing meditation will bring awareness to these energy centers and balance them allowing energy to flow freely in all parts of our body we'll explore these in more detail as we dive into our meditation but for now rest in the knowledge that regardless of how you come into this meditation you will soon bring harmony to each one of these spinning centers of energy to each level of yourself as the chakras begin to balance your overall being will come into greater harmony and transcendence a deep and healing cleanse of your overall aura will take place and soon you will enter into a deep and restful sleep so to begin make sure that you are comfortable you might like to use any cushions or blankets that you need to make sure that your body is prepared to relax fully and sure than any potential distractions such as computers are turned off and that you will not be disturbed as you enter into this healing meditation and sleep once your body is prepared for relaxation allow your mind to follow to invite any lingering thoughts of the day to gently loosen their grip and fall away so let us begin now the tune into your breath in order to guide the mind away from thought let it flow deeply in and out of your body allowing it to renew you in each unfolding moment take a few deep breaths here now on your next inhalation bring your attention to the top of your head and just allowing the breath to follow at its natural rhythm on your next breath in pause for a moment and then allow that exhale to come all the way back down to the base of the spine just breathing slowly and gently continue to pay attention to your breathing for a few more cycles creating a pathway of light of breath along your spine upwards on each inhale and downwards on each exhale allow this breathwork to guide you into a deep state of relaxation now come back to your normal breath allowing it to flow effortlessly through you we'll begin our journey by connecting to the lowest chakra to the root chakra bring your awareness to the base of your spine once more in order to connect with this chakra residing at the pelvic floor this energy center is our base it is from where we harness our sense of support security and safety as we make our way through this journey on earth when the root chakra is balanced we feel grounded and connected to the place we are presently in we feel safe to journey out knowing the deep roots connect us to our inner and outer foundations we can feel the earth steep embrace knowing that the earth provides what we require to live harmoniously the color of this chakra is red take a moment now to breathe deeply into the base of the spine envisioning the warmth of the color red allow it to ground you in the present moment physically emotionally and spiritually know that you are safe here safe to enter into this deep state of relaxation and harmony allow the music my voice your physical world and your inner world to support you begin to introduce slowly and gently the affirmation I am safe and supported I am safe and supported I am safe and supported [Music] continue breathing deeply into the pelvic floor allowing yourself to feel intimately connected to the physical space you rest in sinking Deva to your body [Music] now moving upwards gently guide your attention to the sacral chakra located between the pubic bone and the navel within this swirling vortex of energy we find our sense of creativity intimacy sexuality and connection to others emotions arise from this Center and you may find that as we venture into this space you sense this rising of the emotional world if this is true to your experience at this point or any other moment during this meditation know that you are supported and loved exactly as you are rest in the knowledge that you are being balanced and healed in this very moment simply by allowing the music and these words to permeate your being when the sacral chakra is balanced we experience pleasure abundance joy and warmth we feel intimately connected to those around us and feel harmonious within our relationships we experience the joy of the nature of life the joy of creation so take a moment to envision the color orange now with your attention allow it to permeate this space between your hips just above your pubic bone and feel yourself begin to open up to this warmth and to this healing slowly begin to introduce the affirmation I am connected to others I flow freely I am connected to others I flow really [Music] continue to breathe deeply into the sacral chakra and return to this affirmation as many times as the mind wanders I am connected to others I flow really [Music] we will now continue our ascension to the solar plexus located just above the navel this energy center brings us confidence self-worth and personal power take a moment now to envision this radiant vortex just above the navel ear into its innate power and its warmth [Music] when the solar plexus is balanced we feel a strong sense of purpose motivation and direction when balanced we hold a calm confidence in our ability to manifest the life we desire we move confidently in the direction of our dreams [Music] bring your awareness to the solar plexus now envisioning the radiance and lightness of the color yellow be ovis energy center expanding radiating out from your core and carrying it with a new sensation of aliveness purpose and a sure but subtle strength feel Solar plexis awakening meeting this bright healing yellow light as it grows and expands [Music] now gently introduce the affirmation I radiate confidence I radiate confidence [Music] [Music] [Music] let us move gently now into the heart chakra the home of our innately compassionate and loving nature bring your attention to this space in the center of your chest and envision your heart expanding with each inhale and softening with each exhale [Music] [Music] this middle chakra where our downward moving and upward flowing energies meet in perfect harmony is where our capacity for love resides when balanced we are able to give love unconditionally and we are able to receive the same gift from others and from ourselves [Music] rest now in the simplicity of this beautiful compassionate center envision the color green expanding from the heart with each breath notice the pure energy of the heart radiating outwards healing the heart itself and also the entirety of your being [Music] the hearts message is quite simple take a moment to introduce the affirmation I love and am loved allow it to permeate all cells of your being as you slowly repeat yourself I love and am loved continue to give the heart permission to expand and to soften knowing that it is safe to do so right here right now [Music] gently guide your awareness now up to the throat chakra sitting in the throat area this expansive vortex of energy governs our ability to speak our authentic truth and to listen to that of others allow your attention now to settle here noticing any sensations residing deep in the throat [Music] when the throat chakra is balanced we find a lightness and trust in who we are and find freedom to express our highest truths communication is an open space and an exchange so what we are able to give we are able to receive when balanced we are able to listen compassionately to the true expression of another being begin to envision the color blue expanding from the throat imagining it radiating upwards from where you rest painting the entire sky let it surround you allow your being to flow freely within this vast blue atmosphere [Music] [Music] feel into the lightness of the free air trusting where it gently moves you [Music] gently introduced the mantra I express my truth really i express my truth freely [Music] notice the body becoming lighter as you embrace your expanding authentic being [Music] come now softly to the third eye this energy center swells between your eyebrows and is the Gateway to your inner knowledge take a moment to bring your attention to this space sensing the freely spinning energy exists here [Music] when the third eye is balanced we are able to access our inner knowing and our higher mind with greater ease our perceptions are clearer and our intuition is strengthened we do not need to speak the wisdom that comes at this level we are simply able to witness it and embrace it imagination is heightened as we float effortlessly into this deeper reality [Music] [Music] invision now the powerful color indigo pulsating from the third I simply draw your attention here knowing that there is nothing to figure out nothing to rationalize and nothing to think through just allowing the mind to drift away and let the deeper levels of the mind flow in naturally effortlessly silently introduce the affirmation I see in a wisdom clearly I see in a wisdom clearly allow this truth and the color indigo to bathe and to heal the mind allow yourself to fall further into the depths of your being [Music] [Music] we now come to reach the peak of our scent at the crown chakra bring your attention now to the crown of your head feeling yourself gently opening from this space [Music] this is our connection to the divine to the oneness that connects guides and moves us this space is pure consciousness when the crown balances we come to feel the truth that we are one we feel divinely connected within ourselves and to all that exists outside of us we sense the limitless of pure awareness as our consciousness elevates we feel purity of light the light of pure existence imagine a white light expanding from the crown connecting you to everything that has ever been you are one with the universe intimately linked to it all [Music] [Music] there are no words here there is simply the purity of being you now feel this infinite connection all around you witnessing the energy that expands and flows freely this divine white light begins to expand from your entire being radiating out from every part of you this light this healing light cleanses and heals your aura take a moment to bathe in this lightness in this pure state of existence the universe both within and without has become one in this space there is only pure awareness [Music] [Music] you rest deeper and deeper into this knowledge into this pure state of oneness allowing this healing light to support nurture cleanse and heal you you are witnessing and now experiencing the truth of this existence of this oneness slowly you carry yourself safely gently into the limitless dreamworld of sleep knowing deeply that you are intimately connected to all that is around you you feel balanced cleansed and at peace rest well my friend rest well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]
1 [Music] hello and welcome to the mindful movement I'm Sarah Raymond thank you for joining me this evening for this guided sleep meditation I welcome you on this journey to help you heal while you sleep this meditation will begin by assisting you to relax and prepare for the night ahead once relaxed there will be a series of affirmations that you will hear until you are asleep you can simply listen to the affirmations or if you would like in your mind feel free to repeat them this is designed to help you drift off to sleep while the affirmations are continuing you do not need to be awake to benefit from them your subconscious will hear them as your own words our thoughts and the words we shape them with can influence our body's ability to heal our bodies cells are in constant communication with each other and collectively they hear what we are thinking and saying and therefore having positive thoughts and using positive words can create a healing environment for ourselves ultimately it is always our body that does the healing we only need to provide the right environment the answer is always within us take a moment to make sure you are in a comfortable position that you can drift off to sleep relax enjoy and let the healing begin as you settle into comfort for the night scan your body and make any adjustments you feel you need to sleep peacefully for the entire night so that you can wake refreshed find a position where your spine is straight and your legs are uncrossed look for anywhere you can let go of tension and soften into the surface beneath you

universe in your breath allow your breath to slowly deepen and feel this connection [Music] this is an ever-present connection you have with every breath [Music] this breath right now can link you to the universal life force and this life force flows through you [Music] with every breath it flows through every cell of your body [Music] as you exhale breathe out relaxation [Music] let this lifeforce flow through you like a wave in through the inhale and out or the exhale relaxing you more and more let go of any tension from the day let go of your arms and legs let go of your hips

you now to come into a comfortable lying down position ensuring that your body is resting with ease wherever you are you might want to use blankets or cushions to support you as you find comfort in the physical space you occupy [Music] take a few releasing breaths here allowing a deep sigh to leave your body on your next outward breath [Music] to begin our journey into tranquility take a moment to observe the stillness of your physical body as dei transforms into night and the Sun fades away we are invited to enter a much needed period of rest and rejuvenation as we sink into the stillness of night rest assured there is nothing we need to consciously engage in or take care of we can trust that the body will work by its way of its innate wisdom so take a moment now to quietly observe the miracle of this body [Music] feel into its heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you you might want to notice now where there might still be movement despite the sense of stillness notice where breath brings subtle movement to the body how it causes the chest and stomach to expand on each inhalation and to fall away on each exhalation [Music] observe how beautifully this gentle movement intertwines with a deeper sense of complete stillness as you take a few deep breaths here in silence [Music] if thoughts arise in the mind no that is entirely natural for them to do so as you become aware that your attention has shifted into stories about the past or future simply acknowledge these thoughts from a more distant place than his habit or [Music] while the mind can be useful at times it can lure us into a unproductive thought cycles when left to run on its own terms as we begin to witness our mental movements from a higher or broader vantage point we practice our power of discernment easing challenging thoughts and emotions as we experience greater clarity and a sense of peace [Music] as you journey through this meditation keep this sense of distance in mind as thought arises and returned to your breath as an anchor when needed [Music] move now further into breath awareness as you practice holding your attention on this anchor that is always available to you [Music] notice the breaths wither its pace and its depth as you move alongside it in both directions [Music] hold for a brief pause just a second or two and at the end of each inhalation and each exhalation finding brief moments of complete stillness within each breath cycle [Music] allow the mind to gently subside as you become more attuned to the present moment attachment to worried anxious or distracting thoughts can be released as you practice being the observer of whatever is moving through you just allow yourself to sink further and further into this very moment entering naturally into a state of full-bodied ease and tranquility [Music] with your eyes remaining closed tune into this space between the eyebrows just in front of your mind's eye [Music] envision in this space of vast emptiness something like a clear night sky [Music] sink into this infinite abyss of space and silence for a few moments as you prepare to enter into a cave of complete peace and tranquility [Music] as you gaze with eyes closed into the empty sky in front of you and vision your view dotted with infinite sparkling stars you are in an open outdoor space surrounded by the open air lakes rivers and mountains the moon is high and full [Music] tune into your breath for a few moments noticing the freshness of the air that fills you [Music] just follow my voice for a few breaths here as you inhale deeply breathing in a sense of being completely at ease and exhale slowly releasing any tension or stress in body or mind inhaling again visualizing yourself filling up with peace and ease and exhale fully releasing anything that no longer serves your movement towards complete relaxation breathing deeply once more filling yourself with the freedom and freshness of outdoor air and exhale completely releasing all tension to be transformed by the starlit sky [Music] returned gently to your natural breath allowing your mind to refocus on the empty space in front of your mind's eye [Music] though night has fallen upon this outdoor landscape the land is lit by stars and moonlight granting you with enough light to see the curves of the earth take a moment now to simply observe the way the rocky mountain faced peaks and Falls and the way rivers and lakes gently caressed the hard surface of the earth notice how peaceful it is here beneath the night sky as you feel yourself coming into complete harmony with the natural world from where you stand you see an empty cavern not too far away illuminated by the full moon above its spaciousness its emptiness cause you towards it so you begin to walk slowly and mindfully towards the sheltered space within the mountain [Music] notice the way your feet effortlessly move across the earth you feel completely at home in this natural landscape as you move towards the cave that beckons you quietly [Music] as you reach the opening to this wondrous cave your original sense that it rests unoccupied is confirmed there is no one here but you know plant life inside and no animals the only thing that you have yet to sense within this cave is a deep stillness it is completely silent and yet something about it is calling to you in the faintest whisper recognizable only by your heart [Music] by the entrance of the cave there is a candle placed here by some universal force for whoever might come to rest here you light the candle with a match that has also been provided and quietly make your way inside the dark cavern fear anxiety and worry are completely absent all that is present within you is a growing calmness [Music] he reached the center of this mystical cave that has called you into it setting your candle in the center and bringing yourself to rest comfortably on the floor lying on your back you stare up at the ceiling noticing the incredible edges carved by nature breathing deeply and feel entirely at peace in this open and empty space [Music] silence surrounds you as the mind rests in a deep state of peace and tranquility your breath continues to flow through you effortlessly and gracefully [Music] yet within this vast silence something in this cave is speaking to you the mind cannot decipher it but the heart knows that there is a great wisdom radiating out from these walls you listen more intently to this language still foreign to the mind and find that your heart begins to open up the serenity of this space softens your heart as a deep trust infiltrates your entire being in this serene state you find a calm and the quiet sense of courage to ask this cave any questions that might arise from your purest heart [Music] as you allow your heart to ask these wise walls any questions that arise you find that the questions themselves are infused with trust rather than with fear and anxiety your heart speaks calmly and quietly the mind resting peacefully in the background and as you listen closely with your heart remaining open you find that the walls speak back in silent whispers gently wisely and compassionately this is the language of the heart and you open yourself to it completely [Music] you do not have to search for any answers you trust that they will come in their own time patience and peace arise within you [Music] the cave sends its wisdom in the form of whispers visions and inner sensations though not all at once this mystical cave knows that some answers require extra time to be revealed and that when the time is right the answers will be provided you open your heart even wider sinking further into the peaceful and serene energy of this cave spend a few more silent moments

1 [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation this meditation will help you to harness positive energy achieve deep relaxation and sink into inner peace my name is jason stevenson and during this evening session i will guide you to mindfully ease both mind and body before we journey deep into a healing salt cave there is nothing you need to know for this practice and nothing you need to actively achieve simply let the words offered here guide you back into your innate sense of balance wholeness and presence to begin tonight's meditation just take a moment to ensure that you are as comfortable as you can be supported by any cushions or pillows that you have available whether on your side or on your back ensure that your spine is long and your neck is aligned with your spine you may close your eyes now if you haven't already done so and then just take a few moments to let your mind catch up to the present moment paying attention to what it feels like to be right here right now you might notice the felt sensation of the mattress beneath you or the blankets that cover you or you might open your awareness to the sounds that filter through your ears alternatively you might arrive mentally in this present moment by noticing what it feels like to breathe observing the subtle expansion and contraction that occurs with each breath whatever sensations help you to arrive in the present moment just spend a few moments noticing them without judgment notice if the mind wants to label your experience as good or bad right or wrong and then simply let those labels go as you breathe out coming back to the very simple practice of just noticing [Music] and now take a moment to notice your physical body beginning by drawing your attention to the top of your head from here gently start to scan your body downwards noticing if there are any areas of tension that you might be able to soften or release just simply let any physical tension start to dissolve into the surface beneath you as if it were melting away as we move through this practice you will likely notice that from time to time negative thoughts worries or other unhelpful ideas and images might rise to your awareness these fearful or negative thought patterns are the very things that stand in the way of our experiencing deep peace positivity and relaxation now what typically happens when negative or worried thoughts arise is one of two things first we might find ourselves becoming completely swept up by these mental stories when we are not mindful of these thought patterns they can weigh heavily on our sense of well-being and then a second type of relationship we might have with these thoughts is one of avoidance and suppression avoidance and suppression however are not long-term solutions to troublesome or racing thoughts if what we are after is deep peace positivity and contentment we must first cultivate a more nourishing balanced relationship with our thoughts and from here we can explore the possibility of welcoming positive energy and ideas into our consciousness so as thoughts arise during this meditation i invite you to witness these occurrences as if you were an outside observer of them rather than being caught up in the stream itself consider that you are standing at the side of the riverbank watching mental objects come and watching them go practice this for a few moments on your own now before we move deeper into our salt cave visualization to cultivate positive energy and a deep sense of peace simply observe any thoughts that arise with care and maintaining a subtle gap between them and yourself if certain thoughts seem to have a heavy pull you might alternatively guide these thoughts down to the center of your heart to be released focusing your attention on this loving center in your chest now to cleanse yourself more completely before we step into our visualization i invite you to take three long deep breaths and releasing with a soft sigh through the mouth on each exhalation after that final exhalation let your breath return to its natural rhythm and your attention to turn towards the creative capacity of your mind [Music] within your creative mental space you find yourself now on a rural road both sides lined with summer trees in full blossom aromas of jasmine and lavender dance through the air filling your heart and mind with each full breath the dirt road you are on heads north weaving through the fertile land in the direction of a sweet sanctuary a salt cave spa where you will rest deeply for the night to come all you carry with you is a small backpack of belongings an open mind and a vibrant heart slowly and gently you walk down the country road in the direction of the peaceful retreat absorbing the natural landscape that holds you as you journey you admire the vibrancy and vitality of this summer season you note the pastel purple blossoms in the trees the shimmering meadows and the rich healthy farmland that has been well cared for butterflies flitter from wildflower to wildflower filling the open air with beauty and wonder far into the distance way beyond the furthest trees the sun begins its descent warm orange glow is cast upon the land as the earth spins away from the sun for another day you let your entire body be bathed in its warm it doesn't take long before the spa comes into view the salt cave sanctuary is housed in a grand stone mansion built some centuries ago it is covered in whispering vines and rambling roses the gardens surrounding it are wild yet still well tendered the place is soothing inviting a wave of surrender to wash through your body and mind you make your way closer to the entrance soon arriving on the front porch before entering you take a moment to say good night to the setting sun you revel in the orange pink light that appears above the tree line and then gently you make your way inside you have arrived after regular check-in hours and so a key has been left out for you picking it up you notice that the tag reads salt sweet three and then you follow the hallway that leads to your room the dimly lit spa hallway is infused with the sweet smell of orange oil the soft candles fastened to the walls add an air of elegance while guiding you toward the room that will be yours for the coming night as you reach salt suite 3 you let yourself in with the key unveiling a beautiful softly lit bedroom and another door that leads down to your very own salt cave [Music] upon the bed is a cotton robe dropping your backpack and taking off your shoes you prepare yourself for restorative evening ahead and change into the cozy robe before you enter the door to the salt cave you notice a jug of lemon water has been placed out before you you pour yourself a small glass and then raise it to your lips feeling the properties of both water and lemon cleansing hydrating and alkalizing your body as you sip you feel yourself coming into a deeper state of balance both mentally and physically now you decide to head into the salt cave and as you open the door to enter you are faced with a set of stairs lit by the soft glow of smoldering candles you take a long deep breath in and letting it go with the sigh and then you begin your descent step by step [Music] with each step you take you feel your mind growing more relaxed and your heart growing wider your body softens too your forehead jaw and shoulders all melting towards the wooden stairs beneath your feet [Music] a warm amber glow from the bottom of the staircase entrances you sending a rippling wave of warmth and positivity through your cells and as you reach that lower level your jaw drops at the side of it the cave-like room covered in soft pink salt the walls are made of salt as is the floor beneath you as you step off that final stair it feels as if you are stepping onto a beautiful soothing beach all around you small candles are lit radiating an orange glow through salt candle holders and through the air of the room you notice that sweet smell of orange oil once again you take a long full breath in slowly letting it go as a subtle smile stretches across your face in the center of the room a cushion and blanket rest you make your way towards them and then rest your back on the soothing nourishing salt your head rests on the pillow and you lay the blanket across your body from the neck down arms rest by your sides your feet fall outwards naturally and your entire body surrenders into the salt crystals beneath you [Music] candlelight flickers against the walls and ceiling of the cave guiding you into a calm and tranquil state of being now you become more acutely aware of the music that flows through the cave sounds that work on an energetic level to cleanse both body and mind and to uplift and nourish your vibration as the sounds permeate your cells all worries all fears all limiting beliefs begin to untangle themselves falling away from your body and into the salt beneath you for transformation you feel the warmth of the coarse salt against your body it unwraps you holding you unconditionally against the earth the air you breathe is enriched with salt too rejuvenating your entire being with each breath you soften your belly and relax your shoulders even further allowing each breath to flow as deep as it comfortably reaches [Music] you imagine each breath extending out from your lungs traveling deep into any parts of you that are in need of care and nourishment focusing in on any particular area of concern whether of mind or body you direct the breath to that part of you letting each inhalation bring with it fresh regenerative positive energy and each exhalation to free you of limiting or negative thoughts the salt cave absorbs everything that no longer serves you working its alchemical magic to restore any heavy energy to its original pure state continue to breathe here to bathe in the soothing sounds of the salt cave and to sink into the crystals beneath you the candles continue to burn casting that soft orange light across the cave your own body too absorbs the healing glow as the candles flicker gently they bestow upon you an extra wave of love light and positivity you are growing tired now nearly ready to surrender to the night completely though there is a bed upstairs waiting you you long to rest where you are to sleep amidst the salt crystals and to continue absorbing their positive soothing energy as you slumber you take a moment now to make any final adjustments to your position so that you can drift away effortlessly and then you close your eyes to the salt cave slipping into the empty spaciousness within you the beautiful music continues to flow through your ears carrying you softly into sleep you drift away slowly feeling love and warmth pervading mind body and spirit you know there is nothing left for you to do but to let go to sink further and further into a deep night of peace ease and tranquility your breath and the sound vibrations carry you there until soon you find that you have arrived in the world of sweet and restorative dreams good night my friend good night foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stephenson and welcome to this guided before sleep meditation prepare to be taken on a journey of pure deep relaxation as you connect with your senses and engage with your inner treasures learning from your past present and future moments to experience all the benefits of this guided meditation lie down and get comfortable for a peaceful night of sleep make sure that you will not be disturbed as you settle into a position where you can lie comfortably for the duration of this recording close your eyes and prepare for a deep sense of relaxation sleep and well-being [Music] remember that this is your time a chance for you to escape from the problems of everyday life to allow the tensions of the day to dissipate and to connect with your inner self with your eyes closed breathe deeply and slowly through your nose and then slowly exhale through your mouth allowing any tension within you to disperse as the breath leaves your body [Music] now inhale again breathing in slowly through your nose to a count of four feel the air entering your lungs and extend your diaphragm as you do so enabling the air to reach into the bottom of your lungs once you've done that hold the breath for two seconds and then slowly exhale through your mouth to a count of four once more so it's breathing in for four holding for two counts and breathing out for four this is called rhythmic breathing and it will help you to absorb the techniques required to help you breathe your way through any tensions and to be able to release any worries anxieties or physical tensions each time on the out-breath I'll give you a few moments to do this [Music] now breathe normally in and out through your nose feeling the tension leaving your body as you continue to do so your arms and legs will start to feel heavier and you should feel the back of the chair or the mattress supporting your body as you let all of the tension go if you still feel areas of tension within your body deliberately tighten up those areas holding the muscle tension and then release and feel the difference as your muscles relaxed feel the tension leaving your body as it does so so tighten and release relaxing further and deeper into your meditative state [Music] you [Music] continue the cycle of breath as you imagine walking on a beautiful sandy beach the sand is shimmering under the gentle but warm rays of an early Sun there is a subtle breeze that's teasing your hair and soft against your skin the sky is a beautiful blue cloudless and stretches forever sinking only onto a distant horizon where the sea and the sky unite in a matching Azur color you feel relaxed free and look around you take in the most beautiful picture postcard scene you were sitting in a sheltered Cove with glorious cliffs reaching up into the sky providing a secure backdrop to this perfect scene the rocky cliffs glimmer gray and red with the warming intensity of the Sun and you catch glimpses of white feathers as seabird soar and dive circling on rising thermals distant bird songs filter through the air and the piercing cause of seagulls swooping high and low over the gentle waves brings back childhood memories of seaside escapades a light breeze whips across the sandy cove and the Sun burns even brighter in the sky you stand up and walk along the coastline dealing the warm sand on the soles of your feet and through your toes frothy waves wash up onto the beach and in the distance white sailing boats drift by the feeling is one of peace as you walk along the golden sands you see up ahead what seems like a gentle homeless man with a small dog walking on the edge of the lapping waters he's looking up to the sky muttering to himself and calling out to the seagulls clothed in tattered pants and a white baggy shirt with an overgrown beard carrying two bags of what looks like clothes and blankets he approaches you in turns and speaks directly to you your treasure chest is near in a deep cavern his voice trails off as he passes you however a breeze picks up and you hear his final words riches beyond belief you turn to see him once more however as you do this he and his dog are nowhere to be seen you sit for a moment on the sandy beach to collect your thoughts wondering what that was all about his words echo inside your head your treasure chest is near riches beyond belief getting up from the sand you are drawn to a cliff face opposite the beach that appears to have a cave carved within it out of curiosity you begin to move towards it clambering carefully over small rocks strewn out into their ever reaching tides you wander through small rock pools feeling the coolness of the water on your feet the beach cave looks welcoming and as you approach the rocks have been smoothed as if by hand and you reach out and trail your fingers against the entrance to the cavern walls there is a coolness in places and in others the rocks are warm to the touch where the Sun touches them as you take in the scene in front of you and move forward you see dappling light around the walls of the cave mesmerizing welcoming and intriguing the temperature within the entrance dips immediately but it isn't cold it feels nice to be out of the sunlight for a while marvel at the contours of the beach cave in front of you pockets of stone walkways smooth walls with a contrast of light and dark as small gaps in the rock face allow the Sun to penetrate the darkened depths the beach cave has a strange almost spiritual feel to it peaceful and tranquil and yet it feels as if it has had a purpose not simply carved by the elements but by loving hands smoothing the stone into submission the sound of water can be heard echoing from deeper into the cave although the tide is gently lapping along the rocks leading to the cave entrance inside the low rocks are dry so no danger from an encroaching tide the temperature changes as you move deeper into the labyrinth of cavernous rooms a carved archway lies ahead of you and the cave room within flickers and sparkles with flecks of green as you move into the deeper part of the cavern you hear the words once more vibrating throughout the cave your treasure is near in a cavern riches beyond belief you're drawn to move forward and enter a space so soothing and peaceful that you feel any remaining tension dissipate to your right deeper within the cave you see what looks to be a dusty old ornate chest moving to this large old crate curious to see what this is you blow the dust and sand away it reveals to you what looks to be an ancient old treasure chest could this be the treasure chest the homeless man on the beach was referring to treasure nearby you sit in front of it get comfortable and loosen the already unlocked latches the chest opens it glistens with gold you see that is divided into three sections they're marked past present and future and in each section a small tin boxes [Music] you glanced into the section of the chest marked past and see a little green emerald encrusted tin taking this out easing the lid off slowly you see two folded pieces of paper you unfold the first piece gently and it has printed in beautiful handwritten calligraphy the words let go take a moment to meditate on this what is this telling you is this something from the past that you need to release and let go of perhaps an old relationship a habit that no longer serves you for you or your highest good just take these next few moments to let go and find peace in the release of old and worn-out patterns [Music] you decide to read the next piece of paper you gently unfold it and it says the word forgive you think about this for a moment have you been harboring some distaste for someone or something that has happened to you in your past possibly someone who has mistreated you or maybe you need to forgive yourself and let go of guilt that you have been beating yourself up over for a long time just spend the next few moments contemplating forgiveness and release any pain you've held on to this long enough set yourself free [Music] you place both of these papers back into the emerald tin putting it gently back into the chest where you found it as you do this you feel a cool breeze blow gently throughout the cavern as if clearing away any final thoughts on letting go and forgiveness you reach back into the chest and take out a ruby encrusted tin that has been marked with the word present excited to open this you peel back the old tin lid to reveal a piece of paper that says meditate on three things you are grateful for today give thanks for what you currently have in your life take a moment think this through are you living with a roof over your head do you have food to eat maybe you have great friends family or even a loving pet think of three things you are grateful for in this moment and give thanks true thanks to your higher power within when we are grateful for all we have more of what we want will show up in our lives meditate on these words in the next few moments what am i grateful for [Music] you place the folded paper back into the ruby encrusted tin placing it back in the treasure chest before you you reach in and take up the last small box this one is diamund and crusted it glistens even within the dark cavern itself it has the words future carved in black on the top of the lid you are excited to open this one to see what it holds for you and you open it and notice three pieces of paper within you grab the first one out and slowly unravel it the words my career seemed to appear as if by magic on this paper you give this some thought what is it you truly want to do for your working life what would you want to do if you didn't have to be answerable to anyone envision this take a few moments to see what you are doing what are other people doing or saying that tells you that you have achieved this dream possibly you already have your dream job but want to take a moment to give gratitude be with this for the next few moments see it feel it be it [Music] you place this little piece of paper back in the diamond tin and reach in to grab the other piece of paper opening it up slowly the words relationships and love are written what does this mean for you is there something or someone you would like to attract into your life could there be a way that you could better serve a relationship that you are currently in whether that be a friendship partner or family relationship possibly it's all about a better relationship with yourself loving and accepting yourself more dig deep in the next few moments and see this relationship expand and grow into something beautiful [Music] [Music] finally you place this back into the tin and reach in to pull out the final piece of paper this one says the word health [Music] you give this one some thought are you happy with your current health of your body mind and spirit is there something you could do to help improve your life it will possibly eat less exercise more meditate more to give yourself peace of mind just take the next few moments to meditate and sit with this listen out for any directions visions or phrases that may come to your mind to help give you some clarity in this area of health [Music] you place this little tin back in the chest and just before you close it a breeze tunnels its way through the cavern once more clearing the way for all that you have discovered to take place in your life you sit for a moment in gratitude grateful for the homeless man who guided you here and happy that you have listened to your intuition you leave this treasure chest knowing that it will be here should you wish to come back to it sometime in the near future you begin to make your way towards the entrance of the cave and once more you sit for a moment into a stone carved seat at its entrance take a moment to breathe in deeply and then release deliberately letting go of any tension within your muscles deeply relax all of your muscles feel as each muscle begins to relax let go and if your body wants to sleep allow it to fall asleep the water sounds from the beach almost musical in its consistency from your vantage point you become mesmerised by the beautiful dappled green colors that dab the cave roof or zipped with an artist's brush consider how you feel this moment in time our peaceful how wonderful it feels to be cocooned within this natural place with such peaceful vibrations tell yourself that you are at peace here you are at one with nature remind yourself that life is for living for experiencing for discarding old wounds and for embracing all that lies ahead take a deep breath in through your nose and then breathe out slowly feeling your body relaxed yet further into the stone carved seat relax your body's still further feel your body unwinding the muscles growing heavy total relaxation enveloping you continue to be aware of the breath and use it to channel relaxation throughout your body [Music] [Music] [Music] the warmth from the Sun cocooned your body and brings you back to the present gently breathe in again deeply and then exhale ensuring that no areas of tension exist within you enjoy the feeling of warmth on your skin and the powder blue skies above like a giant canopy stretching across the open cliff expanse you are centered you retain the feeling of peace and wonder enjoy the moment and the feeling of harmony as you sit on the sand and enjoy the last few moments of this meditation before you drift off into a deep slumber enjoy the Sun warm against your skin and the gentle breeze playing with your hair breathe in and then out allowing yourself to drift off deeper and deeper into a deeply relaxed state remember that you can revisit this treasure chest cave of spiritual tranquility at any time you need by simply closing your eyes and allowing the sensations to wash over and embrace you sleep may be coming now the treasure chest awaits your next visit with riches beyond belief [Music] [Music]

to draw positive energy into your life so finding a comfortable place now in which to sit or lie down make sure there are no external distractions it is important that you allow time for your meditation and are not interrupted throughout turn off any phone notifications that you may have set and begin by taking a deep breath in and out to settle yourself closing your eyes and leave or thoughts behind just follow the sound of my voice as I guide you on a journey that is peaceful harmonizing feeling comfortable throughout is important and so now is the time to shift and position yourself if you need to relax fully breathing deeply again and fully exhale and repeat inhale slowly and fully exhale on the breath out let any tension dissipate just let it all go [Music] now it's easy for your mind to wander during a meditation session but don't let that worry you this is natural this is a part of the meditation process and you will soon gain control over your mind just gently and firmly bring it back if your thoughts start to race acknowledge the thought and then bring it back again to your breathing it's all a part of the learning process and you will still gain all the benefits of this meditation session so if you're ready let's begin visualize yourself now transported to the steps leading up to an old bridge made from stone weathered from time and from an assault by the elements there are steps curving upwards with cast iron railings swirling alongside affording magnificent views across the deep tranquil waters surrounded by a mass of greenery the breeze is soft against your skin warm but soothing visualize yourself moving up the steps each step is worn and uneven but they are shallow you find them easy to climb trail your fingers across the top of the railings and feel the iron warm beneath your fingertips at the final step turn and look across the expanse of water it is afternoon and the Sun has started its gradual descent across the sky and as the light changes the trees surrounding the water glow and the colors change for perhaps the first time you become in tune with nature you become aware of the depth of color that exists as clouds scurry across the blue expanse of sky notice how the light shifts and the sun's rays muted send rays of gold across the tranquil waters flecks of light dance on the tips of slow-moving water cresting in places this place exudes serenity you feel calm you feel relaxed you feel peaceful inhale deeply drawing fresh pure oxygen deeply into your lungs exhale fully feeling your lungs deflate as you do so and repeat this intake of breath feeling air inflating your lungs once more and as you breathe out let go of any negative feelings or tension that you may be harboring in your body just let it all go turn your attention back to the scene in front of you and notice the power of blue sky as if dabbed on creatively and mixed with cotton wool white to form the clouds a screen of green adorns the edges of blue the breeze sends leaves whirling up into the air along with the blossom you watch it as it cascades even higher at the mercy of the air current and gradually released dropping towards the surface of the water where once lazy fish rise to the surface to investigate as you stand here and observe you realize that you are an integral part of this scene there is a sense of oneness yet you have not been here before it is as if something has been missing in life previously and now there is a sense of wonder as to what is to come ask yourself who are you deep within what do you need what are you searching for just allow these questions to resonate within you you feel a deeply wonderful connection with nature more than you have thought was possible you feel mesmerised by the sun's rays as they penetrate the foliage casting an almost autumn glow as clouds scurry past the Sun the light changes again and this time the leaves are shimmering gold and yellow these trees are different they Bend and sway teased by the breeze it is as if you are standing on the threshold of two worlds it is as if you're looking back over the past and all that could have been when you turn and look in the other direction your perspective shifts and you are filled with positive energy life is fleeting every second merges with the next and clock hands continue to move never pausing each passing moment striding fords to greet the next and such is life with each season that blends effortlessly the world continues to turn this place feels almost spiritual and it feels as if the missing piece of the puzzle revealing the secrets of the universe as clicked into place this is a place where the past the present and the future merge here life is almost timeless you have time to think to feel and to embrace the positive energy that is here you can contemplate and carve out a route towards happiness in life there are many lessons to be learned as we can learn much through letting go of tension and of deeply relaxing calming the mind only then in your mind perceive all that is possible so relax breathing in and breathing out be at peace with yourself find contentment in this moment as the birds above perform well choreographed flight across the sky effectively using the air currents to lift and twist and turn and butterflies flutter delicately their reflections mirrored in the water below you know that you have never been so at peace with nature you yearn for the freedom to fly and understand that to be free we sometimes have to make changes in life fragrance fills the air as plants lift their faces up to the Sun as you breathe in this delicate fragrance clears any muddled thoughts away and soothes your soul turning now you see a narrow trail leading off into the woodland space and tempted begin to move towards it feeling each step down as you leave the bridge this trail undulates throughout fresh young saplings and shrubs all the eyeing for their place in the sunlight you follow a small Inlet of water that meanders across the narrow trail alongside your chosen pathway it is cooler here with some of the taller trees blocking sunlight with only glimpses of gold penetrating those taller trees and the Rays and you bathe in natural light replenishing your aura you watch as the leaves fall you see each one with a shimmering energy as the leaf spirals around and dances on the breeze this brings an instant sense of reflection into your mind what do you need to let go of in life what changes are necessary to help you grow and develop as a person and to reach your full potential which part of your life needs more focus do you long for love perhaps you need a career satisfaction each one of us needs to find our own pathway through life so that we can reach our true potential and feel great happiness all around you is the purest energy of life which can be utilized at any time you need life love and happiness is here in abundance reach out and draw it to you you are empowered you are in control of your life [Music] insects dart and hover seemingly oblivious to your presence or simply accepting you are a part of this natural scene you feel so peaceful and so relaxed as the bird saw even higher consider the heights at which that inner you can soar to if you let go of the stresses and strains of life do you feel shackled to the past isn't it time to break free and to explore all there is to offer visualize now the chains of life breaking free and breathe in deeply inhaling the purest joy that freedom offers and exhale slowly casting all doubts to one side mentally repeat these words to yourself I allow instinct to guide me I embrace freedom of choice I welcome the opportunity to make life changes I fully embrace my abundant life the sound of water nearby is soothing your eyes feel heavy asleep gently nudges you follow a new pathway taking you to the water's edge where dark and light depths greet you this pathway resonates with you it shows you that life is a series of choices walk the road less traveled and you may be rewarded with experiences and successes you have not thought possible there is an abundance of natural energy light shade love and contentment you only have to let it into your life the Sun shimmers and teases the shallow depth sprinkling light on the surface the contrast is spectacular all around you is nature at its best the energy of the place reverberates deep within you it is a perfect place for relaxation it is as if nature has sculpted a semicircle of trees plants and flowers and there is an abundance of vibrant color and fragrances the tree nearest to the water's edge branches out over the water and one large gnarled old branch reaches inland and across the grassy area beneath your feet tied to the branch a perfect seat for you to relax in so to forge a stronger connection with this tranquil scene you clamber onto this world crafted swing seat which is adorned with deep cushions for support it fits you perfectly and feels so comfortable you feel weightless and as the breeze increases the seat starts to swing gently back and forth you hold on to the strong chords holding the seat and cast your eyes across the river catching a glimpse of the bridge mainly hidden from view by the trees growing alongside the riverbank this is perfection let sleep claim you your eyes are becoming heavier yet your body feels weightless tension dissipates with every intake of breath you feel peaceful you are relaxed you are sleepy [Music] feel the sensation of the supportive cushions soft beneath you and let yourself drift away this is the perfect place for sleep you are a part of nature there is nothing to disturb you in this place you are safe you are peaceful you are an integral part of the universe and as you breathe in and out you replenish your mind body and soul with healing energy and life-giving oxygen with each breath out relax even further releasing any negative thoughts or feelings let them go breathing in positive energy and on your exhale release old worn out negative patterns blow them away allow the light of potential for your future to shine brightly think of it as a star that leads the way towards successes and whatever your heart desires as you feel yourself slowly falling asleep know that your subconscious mind will work on solving any of life's questions or problems while you sleep deeply it's time to let go of anxiety of unresolved traumas or outstanding issues nothing matters at this moment but to simply be this is your place you can return here at any time you need all you need to do is close your eyes focus on your breathing and transport yourself back to the bridge as if the entry point to this tranquil setting here there is only positive energy visit at night or during the day visit whenever you need to each time you come here your senses will be awash with the wonders of positive energy and well-being each time you'll be greeted with new science and new sensations every experience every sensation promotes your personal positive energy within this place you open your perception the gentle swaying of the trees highlights your need to be flexible in life the falling of leaves highlights you'll need to let go of some elements that hold you back in your own life the bird soaring overhead I like your need to be free and to reach your full potential the gentle sound of water as it passes on reminds you of your need to be flexible in life and to go with the flow now it's time to let go of muddled thoughts and self doubts you see life clearly the universe and the natural wonders of the world provides you with energy to inspire to encourage and to see the best route through life for you here there is an abundance of positivity you have it all everything you need to carve out the life you have always wanted let's leap claim you now your eyes are getting heavier [Music] that all thoughts dissipate yeah there are no thoughts or feelings beyond the sensation of peace let yourself drift away sleep deeply you will wake up when your mind and body is fully replenished but until then allow the tranquil setting the gentle movement of your comfortable swing seat and the sounds of nature to lull you into a contented and peaceful state inhale deeply and exhale fully drift away if you want to end this meditation now simply stretch out and open your eyes however if you want to continue just allow the sounds of nature to take you away [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
1 [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] welcome to your the magic walk guided meditation for anxiety relief close your eyes and imagine every fiber of your body relaxing as if a great weight has been taken off your entire body allow your chest and belly to inflate filling with the air around you notice the way you were holding your eyes your shoulders your feet if you feel any tension or worry imagine it melting just like butter in the Sun breathe deeply and relax in your mind's eye and vision yourself standing up and approaching the wall nearest you as you get closer to it you notice a door appearing let yourself be drawn to this door and when you reach it open it [Applause] pass through to the staircase beyond where you sense the warm beckoning presence of a familiar place ascend the stairs feeling yourself grow more and more relaxed as you reach the top you are in a library a place you may have been before ahead of you Liars a comfortable looking chair with a small sandy colored book lying on the cushion let yourself sink into the chair and pick up the book as you open the cover and begin to read you notice the type growing larger filling your vision completely almost as soon as it begins it dissolves away leaving you in a totally new and different place you are sitting on a warm stone wall above you is the electric-blue of a summer sky and surrounding you are wildflowers growing out of the sandy soil breathe in the scent of these blooms and listen to the gentle rustle of their leaves in the slightest of breezes this place is safe and comforting a stone wall you are seated on radiates the sun's warmth filling your body with a heady sense of power feel the way the heat from the rock and the sky above you touches your skin warming you to the core you realize that just as the rock holds the sun's rays you hold and radiate your own incredible power even on cloudy days the Sun is still there and even when you feel weak or powerless your strength and unbreakable will are there as well next to you on the wall is a simply made pottery jug and a glass bottle with a cork the bottle is empty but the jug is full of an inky black liquid at the very core of your being you realize that this black substance represents your fears and anxieties stored deep inside your subconscious mind it is normal to carry fear with you sometimes however our busy lives do not leave us time to address these anxieties and they can fill up this jug inside your mind when you feel anxious it is simply your mind asking you to spend a moment or two relaxing and tending to this need this is what this time is for as we move through this meditation you will have the opportunity to cleanse yourself of all anxiousness and stress that you carry with you right now pick up the jug feeling the underlying complexity of its earthenware construction to not be afraid of this vessel nothing it contains is harmful you are entirely safe as you peer over the lip of this jug and look into your reflection in the black liquid as you hold the jug you feel the warmth from your hands and the Sun warming it and you realize that you are about to recognize the sources of your fears at a deep level of understanding and forgiveness so take a moment to watch your reflection begin to shift forming itself into whatever picture you need to see to understand your anxiety perhaps more than one scene will appear either way smile gently and say thank you to each picture you encounter expressing gratitude for its work and message in your life [Music] [Music] as the scenes in the jug dissolve back into the liquid allow yourself to pick up the glass bottle next to you remove the cork and pour the contents of the jug into it knowing that you cannot spill the black liquid now that you have communicated with it once every last drop of the liquid has left the jug carefully replace the bottle stopper and stand up you take a few steps forward and see that you have been sitting on the rock wall overlooking a very deep valley in your heart you know that no one has ever seen this valley except for you and that it is a perfect reflection of your own innate power take a moment to reflect on what you see below and understand that it is a geological expression of you and your unbreakable will you need not be afraid anymore [Music] with this euphoric realization feel the weight of the glass bottle in your hand raise your arm over your head and giving one last thank you to the liquid inside the glass throw it as hard as you can into the valley below you see the glass bottle shatter far below you the inky black liquid spilling out across the ground yet before your eyes it begins to evaporate turning into a silver shimmery mist at the base of the cliff you hear faint strains of song out of the Mist emerge thousands of birds their feathers all the cars of the rainbow they fly up and into the sky above you swirling and dipping in an aerial dance of pure delight watch their patterns as they move across the sky and allow yourself to realize that you yourself have transformed your fear and anxiety into this beautiful spectacle before your eyes listen to the birds jubilant song and watch the way they colored bodies flutter across the electric blue sky you have created this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the birds make a huge lap through the valley a farewell signal to you and dispersed far into the distance you smile wishing them the best of luck in everything they do as you do this you sense something behind you and when you turn around you realize it is the book from the library before your eyes it opens and the familiar sight of printed letters floods your vision lifting you from the warmth of the stone cliff the letters rush faster and faster then dissolve leaving you sitting back in the library the book resting on your lap allow yourself to rise and return to the staircase passing shelf after shelf of familiar books approach the staircase and begin your descent allowing the library to grow smaller behind you as you come closer and closer to consciousness as you approach the door below you you feel the same sense of power you felt by the stone war rushed through your veins you've contained the strength of character to change anything you encounter allow yourself to hold this sense of confidence and purpose with you as you approach the place you began this meditation you have returned from this meditation a changed person and so begin to wiggle your fingers and toes gently wake up the parts of you that have rested why you are on your journey when you are ready let your eyes open and smile at the world around you you are powerful enough to transform fear into beauty now allow this ever-present strength to guide you through the rest of your day or evening [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you

1 hello there my name is jason stevenson and welcome to tonight's guided meditation to help calm the mind and release anxious thoughts in tonight's meditation i'll provide you with guidance to witness anxious thought streams to surrender to them and to return to your inner peace whoever you are no matter what you are experiencing you are welcome here we will move through this process slowly and gently and you'll be given plenty of time to shift and soften any anxiety that is present for you during this practice you are encouraged to drift off to sleep whenever slumber comes naturally for you so we will begin by taking a few moments to settle in through breath and body awareness and then i will guide you to a comfortable place in the middle of a tranquil forest an environment that will further help you to let go and so before we begin take a moment to find a comfortable laying down position that will be supportive of deep sleep when the time comes just allow your spine to lengthen and your limbs to soften as you feel into how gravity is holding you here right now closing your eyes whenever you feel ready and take a moment to check in with your physical body just inquire with your body about whether you might need anything else in this moment perhaps a pillow a blanket a pair of socks or any other adjustment and when you're ready find a comfortable position of relative stillness you don't need to aim for complete stillness as your body is always in subtle motion anyways but see if you can surrender as much as you can into non-doing knowing that you are always free to make adjustments as you need to throughout the practice and turn your attention towards the breath for a few moments now just minding its natural rhythm as it moves through your body and for the next few breath cycles refrain from changing the breath in any way simply allow it to flow naturally while also considering the fact that each full breath cleanses and nourishes and supports you each breath in restores your blood of the oxygen it requires and each breath out emits what no longer serve you and now i invite you to take three deep breaths at your own pace beginning whenever you are ready and inhaling to the furthest depth that is still comfortable for you and then exhale maybe releasing a soft sigh or anything else that yearns to be let go of inhale completely and exhale what you no longer need after your third deep breath just continue to breathe naturally and then take a moment to re-ground into the surface supporting you and just take note of each part of your body that is in contact with your bed and noting the sensation of fabric against your skin and before we move into the forest inside your mind just take a moment to offer a word of gratitude for the place that holds you right now make a note of any aspects of your environment that you can be thankful for in this very moment and when you're finished turn towards the creative center within your own mind and through your mind i invite you to travel consciously now finding yourself in a brilliant forest held beneath the warm late summer sun you were standing on a narrow footpath of aromatic amber soil and on either side of you majestic trees stretch up towards the beaming cosmos the wind is warm as it brushes just gently against your cheeks standing here in the wilderness of these woods your shoulders begin to soften and drop this forest sanctuary comes to you as a refuge away from the weight of the world from all that you felt you needed to carry in the days up until now for these precious moments i invite you to grant yourself permission to let go to simply tune into what is right here and to open up to the possibility of deep release and inner peace as you grant yourself this permission you know that you don't need to force yourself to feel any different than you do right now and furthermore know that opening up to inner peace does not mean that all of your outer world challenges will disappear however consider that there is a chance of finding respite beneath the waves of the worried mind know only that this peace and tranquility is possible opening your heart to the journey that guide you there now take a moment to feel into your body here in the forest as you witness yourself acclimatizing to your new environment perhaps you might see yourself stretch your arms up towards the sky or reaching down to the earth in reverence witness yourself moving in any way that helps to free up and release stagnant or anxious energy within your body eventually you returned to standing gazing down the trail stretched out before you the path ahead is whimsical weaving in and out of the old growth forest you take a long deep breath inhaling the forest air and as you exhale you begin on your way taking the trail mindful step by step as you go you absorb the beauty of the forest around you hummingbirds flitter through the air and squirrels and chipmunks jump from treetop to treetop ancient ferns rise up from the earth in their cosmic patterns and countless other species of plants and animals make themselves known to you in fact the diversity is beyond anything you've ever seen take a moment to explore the environment for yourself as you walk through it allow it to come to life with any plants animals or even insects that bring you a sense of peace and well-being consider the fact that your inner forest is completely unique to your own mind and imagination and bring it to life in any way that soothes you in other words plant your inner refuge as you please as you witness the peace that lives in this forest notice how a sense of ease grows inside of you notice your belly softening your limbs relaxing and your worried or controlling mind letting go even further breath by breath by breath simply just being in this forest provides you with something you it helps you to naturally and effortlessly begin the process of letting go now soften your gaze on the plants and animals of this forest as you focus once again on the trail ahead of you as you do you notice that this pathway ends just a few meters up ahead and where it does there is a small clearing in the woods you make your way towards the clearing which enchants your heart and mind completely it's surrounded by tall ancient trees with wild flowers lining the perimeter teal violet and fuchsia petals are in full bloom the soil in the clearing is bare but it's still rich and full of invisible energy and in the center of it a tiny nest of sorts has been laid out for you a persian rug is spread across the solid earth and on top of it plush cushions and blankets are scattered this human-like nest in the middle of the forest has your name on it and so you make yourself cozy within it as you come to rest your back on the soft rug in the middle of the forest wriggling your body to get comfortable you take a few deep breaths to settle in and softening your belly as you breathe with each breath in you embrace the vitality of the forest around you and with each outward breath you feel yourself melting a little bit further into the earth each breath brings you back to what is right here back to the peace that is possible when you connect with what is present you continue to breathe naturally as you gaze out at the world from the surface of the earth those majestic trees stand even taller with canopies that dance through the glistening sun the trees are alive you can feel their energy and you embrace their shelter their stability and their protection now gazing up at the canopy you see that there is enough open space for the sunlight to pour through as it does it blesses your entire body not only does it offer you its warmth it offers ease and release as well to further soothe the mind you tune in more closely to the physical body as it rests beneath this glorious sun you begin by drawing your attention towards your crown feeling the golden light of this radiant star penetrating opening and softening the uppermost part of you this light begins to seep downwards relaxing all the muscles around your eyes it disarms the flow of any repetitive and unhelpful thought patterns you exhale to release surrendering your mind to the cleansing power of this light and then you feel the sun's rays inch further down filling and relaxing your jaw your tongue and your throat you take a long deep breath into this golden light feeling it ease any tension you've been carrying in and around this part of you still resting on the forest floor you feel into the sun's light as it enters your shoulders and then as it slowly seeps into your upper arms your elbows and lower arms and into your hands as this metallic yellow light fills you from shoulders to fingertips you feel your arms let go you feel them surrender you know that there is nothing you need to latch onto nothing you need to fix to grasp or to sort out you just grant your arms permission to surrender the light from your shoulders now enters into your upper torso your lower back melts it surrenders and your heart space opens up to the universal light that touches it as you breathe life force moves into and out of your heart with complete ease and then the golden light seeps even further downwards tracing the length of your spine until it lands in the center of your belly as you breathe here feel your belly filling with radiant sunlight it dissolves all tension all contraction and all worry helping you to breathe a little deeper at the same time your lower back begins to soften as well coming into deeper and deeper peace here in the forest where you rest you witness as the sun's glow enters your pelvic region now and as it does your hips begin to unknot tension begins to melt seeping into the earth beneath you for renewal and finally the golden light of the sun begins to inch its way down your legs first it fills your upper legs relaxing all of these muscles completely then it flows down to your knees into your calves and shins and eventually into your feet into each and every toe feel both of your legs surrendering with the support of the light shining down from above you waves of calm pulse through your entire body follow them for a moment now witnessing them as currents of golden light ebbing and flowing from the top of your head to your toes and then from your toes to the top of your head and back again as this golden wave of calm rises up to your crown it eases your mind and connects you to everything around you and as it ebbs back towards your feet it grounds you deep into the earth providing you with a sense of strength and resilience the sun's rays continue to hold you as you tune into other elements of the forest now first you notice the sweet aroma that fills your nostrils as you breathe you absorb the aliveness of the forest with each full breath then your eyes trace the lengths of those remarkable trees which are firmly rooted calm and stable you admire the base of the trees and the intricate pattern of their bark and then your gaze rises up them noticing the complexity of branches that extend out from the solid stable core the leaves on those upper branches are diverse and varied even from down below you can see that some are round some are triangular and some are irregular like the leaves of the chestnut trees and the maples just together they dance seamlessly in the soft breeze occasionally you witness a leaf splitting from its branch and dancing down towards the earth you admire how effortlessly it lets go how naturally it surrenders as you gaze up at the leaves you realize how transient they are seasons come and seasons go and throughout the seasons the trees shed their leaves in order to be renewed and so you liken the leaves above you to the thoughts that come and go for seasons in your mind anxious or worried thoughts are just as transient as those delicate leaves that shimmer in the wind and so as you rest here beneath the canopy pair each falling leaf with an anxious ruminating or worried thought that you would like to release or soften as one of these thoughts come to mind see it falling towards the rich and fertile earth as a delicate leaf does at the end of its season as each leaf of anxiety or worry falls towards the earth something remarkable happens time appears to speed up in your mind's eye as you watch each fallen leaf transmute from vibrant green to deep red to dark rust and quickly as if you were watching time-lapsed film you observe each leaf decay becoming one with the bed of soil it rests on continue to watch this miraculous process of transformation on your own link each anxious thought with a falling leaf and as it arrives on the earth watch as alchemy takes over what begins as a worried delicate leaf fluttering in the wind of life is capable of transforming of becoming rich dense soil through the ever-present possibility of transformation remember that your body is a tool to facilitate release with each thought that surrenders to the earth allow the body to surrender as well by relaxing your body you encourage the mind to do the same any and all sorts of anxious thoughts can be processed in this way so long as the cause of your concern does not require urgent action in this moment it's possible to tap into a sense of surrender and to let go of anxious thoughts does not mean we don't care about certain outcomes or that we are in denial of how we feel rather it's a simple recognition that the past cannot be returned to that the future is undetermined and that all we have is the present moment and in this present moment we can choose to open ourselves up to deeper peace you continue to rest on the forest floor bundled up as the sun moves behind the canopy now the air is still warm and so you are completely comfortable take a few more moments of silence to watch leaves of anxious thoughts fall towards the earth watch them quickly and effortlessly turn into dried leaves and then into soil itself your eyes are growing tired but you continue to absorb the tranquility of the world around you here amongst the plants insects and trees you realize that anxiety is not a concern the various beings that call this forest home simply go about their lives they know what needs to be done and they do it and the rest they leave an awareness grows within you that nature doesn't need to worry yes there are times when it must leap into action to protect itself but it doesn't over ruminate it doesn't overthink this recognition alone helps you to breathe deeper helps you to further surrender you come back to your breathing feeling the natural rhythm of this cycle moving through you just like the seasons the breath comes and it goes it comes and it goes you feel yourself surrendering deeper to this universal wisdom of the breath you realize that there is indeed an innate universal force that is holding you and supporting you you realize now that you do not need to do nor do you accomplish everything on your own and so if you'd like to i invite you now to ask the universal energy all around you for any support that you need for a final release in other words is there something that you are still struggling to let go of something that you need support with and if so turn towards the sky that seeps through the canopy overhead and ask for its wisdom for its support if you hear a wise voice offer its support to you know that not only does it come from the universe around you it comes simultaneously from inside your very own being you are the holder of the wisdom that you seek for a few more silent moments come back to the falling leaves let any thoughts that do not serve you be surrendered now allow the universe and your inherent wisdom to support you with this if it feels natural for you you might even tap into a sense of joy as you observe the falling leaves letting go doesn't always have to be difficult often there is joy in release now you can tell by the movement of shadows that the sun is beginning its final departure the forest appears to be preparing for a good night's rest animals have slowed their stirring butterflies have retreated for the night and all that remains in their place is near stillness as the earth slows down so do you the mind which had already experienced a sense of quiet tranquility slows even further you are beginning to pass into the state between wakefulness and sleep but before you drift off completely you continue to take in the radiance of the world around you namely the colors in this evening sky first the sky illuminates with a soft clementine orange glow it doesn't quite reach the uppermost cosmos but the horizon casts its light through the surrounding trees this radiant orange light floats across your body granting you warmth and balance and vitality from head to toe you open yourself up to it completely soon the orange light in the sky begins to transmute electric magenta begins to shine through in its place as it covers your body it grants you a sense of childlike wonder magic and trust open your heart to this enchanting pink glow the light in the sky continues to shift soon the once pink glow becomes a deep mesmerizing violet a color associated with wisdom spiritual connection and the soothing of emotions you feel yourself coming into complete alignment as this violet light passes over you all of your cells all of your muscles your nerve endings and all of your organs are touched by this cleansing radiant light it fills your entire body from the tips of your toes to the crown of your head and as it fills your mind space it dispels any last ruminating thought patterns that may have been stubbornly holding on you don't need to bring them with you into the slumber ahead the dark violet color grows deeper soon becoming a midnight blue you can still make out the night sky against the black silhouette of trees overhead and through that empty space that exposes you to the cosmos the milky way begins to appear the thick blanket of stars is mesmerizing you feel completely safe and supported here in the forest somehow as the day has departed and the midnight hour creeps closer you have gained an embodied sense of belonging you feel a part of this forest a part of this entire earth and universe in fact and it is this deep sense of belonging that awakens your inner peace worried thoughts may still rise from time to time but you've gained a new perspective of them ear gazing out at the milky way you realize that in fact you are not looking out at the stars you are a part of them and being a part of the universe like this you are unconditionally supported through everything you are unconditionally loved sink into this deeper understanding of your belonging for a few long deep breaths if you'd like to you might want to release a soft sigh with each exhalation if any worries or anxious thoughts creep back know that you hold the power to release and to soften them just refrain from judging these thoughts or pushing them away simply acknowledge them as a part of yourself that simply needs your love and compassion grant them your love let them know how strong you are and then allow these unhelpful thoughts just to fade away through the canopy above you catch side of the moon making itself known to the dark sky tonight it is a waning crescent moon fading into darkness day by day by day this waning moon offers a final reminder to surrender it invites you to make space by cleansing the old so that you may set new intentions and new belief systems to empower you in the days to come so as you gaze up at the radiant silver of the moon take a moment to consider what intention you'd like to set for the day that awaits you what qualities or ways of being would you like to harness while you sleep and carry into tomorrow once you have your intention silently repeat it to the moon three times release your words of intention when you've finished your third repetition and sinking back into the silent stillness of the evening forest feel back into your breath observing once again it's continual coming and going and as you breathe listen closely see if you can hear the sound that it makes if you can hear it liken this sound to the soft flow of wind through a tranquil forest canopy like the one overhead of you now you close your eyes and once again you can feel your body being penetrated with soothing light energy this time it's not the sun it is the subtlety of the moon and so eyes closed to the forest around you you feel into the silver light of this moon first it weaves its way into the crown and headspace reminding you to let go again and again and again as many times as is needed it then ebbs its way into your cheeks your mouth and your throat helping to release your jaw and anything you've been clenching onto there you then feel the moon's glow moving into your shoulders and as it does you release your shoulders into the earth words of the indian scholar and environmental activist vandana shiva come to mind you hear her whisper you are not atlas carrying the world on your shoulders it is good to remember that the planet is carrying you now the silver light seeps into the full lengths of your arms just as the sun did all those moments ago the silver light brings deep release to each of your muscles from those in your shoulders all the way down to your fingers let them go let each of those muscles surrender for the night you trace the silver light back up and into your chest now where it creates a sense of spaciousness your heart area illuminates with bright silver light and it grows with each inhalation if any thoughts arise from now on you can guide them into this luminescent heart for transformation now the silver thread of light weaves its way along your spine each vertebrae that it passes surrenders to the evening and eventually your stomach fills with this subtle silver glow and feel your breath as it moves into this space the silver glow expanding in your belly with each full breath and it softens all areas around your core front and back side to side this calming silver energy enters into your hips and pelvis bringing softness to this part of you one last time before sleep and then it weaves its way through your upper legs past your knees into your lower legs ending its journey at the tips of your toes just allow both legs to relax in their entirety take a few full breaths as you bathe in this silver light of the moon and if you find that there's any specific part of you that longs for a little more silver light energy draw your attention there let it fill to the brim with the light of the moon and when you are ready let the imagery of this silver light soften now the moon is still there high up in the night sky but you can shift your attention to any other anchor that feels soothing for you perhaps you focus on the breath inhaling and exhaling the fresh nourishing air perhaps you focus on what it feels like to be held against the earth by gravity what it feels like for each part of your body to fully surrender each muscle to fully relax into the surface beneath you perhaps you gaze up at the milky way at the tops of the trees or at some other point in nature that soothes and settles you just whatever brings you a sense of peace presence and well-being let that be your anchor for a short while longer and slowly now i invite you to release the imagery of the forest from your mind as you gently shift your awareness back to this physical reality keep your mind soft you've not physically gone anywhere and so you don't need to return you've always been here you've always been held by this space the entire time if you are still with me i trust that sleep will be coming soon for you between now and then use whatever anchor you please to keep your attention focused and your mind calm the peace and tranquility you experienced here tonight was not a product of anything outside of yourself it came from within remember this deeper truth anytime the mind seems to wander off on its own remember that you hold the power in all moments in all breaths to bring yourself back to peace the seeds of your inner forest refuge are always there always available to be tuned into good night my friend good night you

1 hello my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to fall asleep quickly and effortlessly after a brief journey through the body we will take a trip into the cosmos during which you will fall asleep swiftly held beneath the soft glow of the moon and the stars allow the words of this meditation to flow effortlessly through you there is nothing you need to hold on to allow yourself to surrender into slumber at any point during this practice [Music] now to begin ensure that all end-of-day activities are taken care of your blind should be drawn any required alarms should be set and all lights turned off or shut out so that your body knows it's time to rest deeply eyes closed take a moment to land in the space that holds you making any necessary adjustments to your posture for extra comfort let your neck form one straight line with your spine as all muscles soften into the bed or other surface beneath you [Music] turn your attention towards the breath as you spend a few moments grounding through this force of life that gently ebbs and flows through your body as you watch your breath know that there is nothing it needs to do in no particular way it needs to flow our breath contains a wisdom that knows just how to support and nourish us all that is required is that we slowly step out of its way by easing the mind and relaxing the body as we move through this practice know that you can come back to the breath any time you need to anchor yourself back into the present moment the breath your physical body and these words all serve that purpose each invite you to come back down into the sweet simplicity of this night now let's take a moment to travel through the body softening each part that our awareness moves through begin now by drawing your attention to the crown of your head holding your awareness there for a few moments [Music] imagine this uppermost part of your body softening and a process that trickles down slowly to ease your forehead your eyebrows and your temples let your entire top half of your head relax releasing all physical and mental tension it might be holding and then slowly let this softening seep into your cheekbones and your jaw your mouth and your tongue as your awareness gently descends further it brings softness to your neck and your shoulders helping them to release any weight they may have carried throughout the day and then envision that softening trickling down your arms relaxing each and every cell all the way to your fingertips returning your attention to your heart space now allow your chest to relax and your upper back as well and then slowly scan the length of your spine downwards inviting all tissues and muscles that surround it to surrender deeper into this night [Music] your attention centers itself in the belly now and let all muscles around your core relax as the belly rises and falls with each breath and then allow your awareness to soften the hips the pelvis and the buttocks before gently trickling down the legs softening each muscle completely until arriving at the tips of your toes [Music] hold your entire body in your awareness letting it surrender completely into the surface beneath you you might notice a heaviness within your body as well as a lightness the sense that your body has given up completely to the weight of gravity while at the same time feeling entirely free and weightless let yourself revel in that sensation for a few breaths now the feeling of being held by gravity while also freely floating within the airy cosmic universe [Music] [Music] in just a moment we will begin a journey into the stars floating gracefully away from the earth yet before we do so let's take a moment to realize where we are truly headed and that is into a deep and restorative slumber so before we begin our ascension into the cosmos take a moment to silently repeat i let go let go i let go surrendering completely to the weightlessness of [Music] sleep in your mind's eye as your body and mind become lighter i invite you to envision that you are resting in an open meadow beneath the starry sky a soft blanket of grass rests beneath you your body is kept warm amidst the summer air the breeze whistles in the leaves of nearby trees rustling through tall grasses as well the night sky is onyx black reflecting darkness into your eyes but for the dazzling stars and crescent moon above you [Music] the world is quiet around and within you you inhale the evening air filling yourself up with the airy cosmos you are a part of each breath in brings a lightness to your body [Music] and each breath out helps you to let go to surrender to the sky above and around you as your body gets lighter you notice the earth beneath you drifting away suddenly you are light enough to be untouched by the weight of gravity your body rising above the ground and into the night sky you are not afraid you know you are protected here so surrender to the process you are in allowing yourself to be carried away from the earth and into the stars [Music] your body floats higher and higher passing through thin veils of cloud that grace the atmosphere the air around you is quiet as is your mind space up here amidst the clouds and beneath the light of the moon nothing of your life on earth seems to matter all that matters is this miraculous open space you drift through drifting further away from the earth you take a moment to look down upon it the entire globe is in full view the atmosphere around it dark and peaceful and twinkling lights shine back at you as if mimicking the stars no sounds of the earth can be heard from where you are no traffic no wind no moving water you are miles away now [Music] your entire body floats higher still and as it does the stars become larger and brighter [Music] your eyes land on one star in particular and everything else seems to melt away you spend some time with this star whispering your intentions for the coming day and inviting it to support you in surrendering to the night your breath is still soft nourishing you as you float high above the earth you take one last moment to commune with your favorite star before letting your attention widen to all the other celestial bodies that find their home within the sky planets comets and shooting stars all come into view as you gaze into the abyss of the cosmos still you know you are held safe by the universe here you are calm peaceful and entirely at ease [Music] you consider all the constellations that are spread out before you indeed they look different from this higher vantage point their patterns not so easily observed this close up and yet you reflect upon some of your favorites orion libra capricorn and aquarius now that you are here in the realm of all the constellations [Music] you understand why ancient traditions and cultures have long held up these celestial formations the closer you get to them the more remarkable they come the more they enchant your mind heart and soul come back to your breath with full awareness now inhaling and exhaling deeply your body remains light and free as you drift through the cosmos reveling at the stars now like a feather gliding through the air slowly and steadily you feel your body slowly coming back down some magic mysterious force holds you supporting you as you move gracefully away from the realm of planets stars and the moon you do not return to the earth just yet though with grace you land gently upon a plush supportive cloud you release a deep sigh as you sink into this cosmic cushion letting it support you from head to toe as you rest here you find stillness [Music] you gaze up at the mystery of the atmosphere above you eyes landing on the silver of the moon that is transitioning through its waning face in a few nights from now it will become a dark and dazzling new moon and yet for now it is waning slowly growing smaller at a rate too slow for the human eye to catch in a single moment you consider the energy of the waning moon remembering that this particular lunar transition is a time for releasing slowing down surrendering and restoring now is the time to sink into non-doing to let yourself be exactly as you are perched on a cloud you take three full breaths each inhale lasting to a count of four and each exhale being a little bit longer lasting to a count of six inhaling for four and exhaling for six [Music] you finish one more breath this way allowing your exhale to cleanse you of any residual tension or weight you may be unconsciously holding allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm your body is relaxed your mind is relaxed and you are ready to completely surrender you take one more moment to gaze up at the night sky from this height you thank it for all that it has illuminated within you and then slowly you drift like a feather once again inching your way closer towards the solid earth as you make your final approach held through this transition by a gentle and mysterious force you count down from ten to let go more completely ten your mind is quiet held in the silence of the night nine your body is relaxed fully trusting of the universe that supports it eight your heart is open awake to the mystery and beauty of the world seven your shoulders surrender the weight of the world having been freed from them six your jaw is relaxed knowing there is nothing that needs to be expressed five your hands are free free of any desire to grasp attain or achieve 4. your legs are relaxed knowing there is nowhere they need to carry you three your soul is at peace pleased with the journey it has just embarked on two your eyes and eyebrows are softened knowing there is nothing left to be seen one your entire body is aligned feeling fully prepared to take the next journey into slumber zero your body grounds back down gently slowly coming into contact with the earth once again as the journey through the stars is now but a memory take a moment to let all visuals disappear from your mind as you come back to the felt experience of being held by the surface beneath you from head to toe every part of your miraculous body surrenders your mental and emotional body to sink into a soft and tranquil stillness connected once again to the physical earth that supports you you revel in the sensation of being both heavy and light simultaneously feel gratitude for the force of gravity re-tethering you to the beautiful and solid earth beneath you and deep appreciation for the mysterious enchanted realm of the cosmos for the lightness illumination and the magic it offers just allow your breath to flow through you with ease once again slowly allowing it to guide you into the final stage of surrender for the night with each exhale you let go you let go you let go sleep well my friend sleep well so you  English (auto-generated)

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this guided meditation this is the positive miracles guided sleep meditation I'm Jason Stephenson we're often told about the importance and power of being positive but knowing that we should be positive is one thing but actually being positive is another and when the day's stresses pile up and things don't work our way it's too easy to give in to our emotions and feel anything but positive and it makes it harder for us to go to sleep when this continues we sometimes give in to feelings of inadequacy believing that we're not good enough or worthy enough and never will be at the very worst we may begin to suspect that there's a vast conspiracy determined to foil us at every turn and thus cynics are born these perpetuate a terrible cycle they believe they're not good enough or that things will never work their way they therefore become blind to wonderful opportunities awaiting them at every corner thus reinforcing their own beliefs and this is the prison of negative thinking now this meditation is the antidote to such a prison the aim of this meditation is to get you to sleep with miracles of positive and kind intentions so let's begin now for this one you can prepare as you would go into sleep lying down on your back or you can sit upright with your spine straight and this allows you to maintain an upright but comfortable position without strain to help you breathe more easily and maintain a good balance let your shoulders relax and rest your hands palms up on your lap or by your side if you are lying down this stabilizes you rolls your shoulders back and opens up your rib cage now facing straight ahead and pretend that you're the CEO of a major company or the ruler of a powerful country in your hands lies the fate of millions you are a very important person so project your power through your upright and confident but relaxed posture and because of who and what you are you have earned the right to just be for now all appointments meetings schedules and deadlines they can all wait but now they must take a back seat to what you are about to do so keeping your lips closed relax your jaw so that there's a gap between your teeth and rest the tip of your tongue against the back of your upper teeth gently close your eyes so your work can begin now please pay attention to your breathing and notice how it moves in and out of your body and how your body responds to it and that's breathing now in and out through your nose notice how your body feels a sense of expansion as you breathe in and how your body contracts as you exhale bring your focus now to your stomach and as you breathe in bring the breath here so that it bloats with each inhalation and as you exhale feel your stomach contract you [Music] so in a few more moments I'm going to direct your breath by asking you to inhale and to exhale to a slow count of three ready inhale one one-thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand exhale one one-thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand inhale 1 2 3 exhale 1 2 3 inhale exhale now trying to keep this pattern of slower breathing for the remainder of this meditation just slowing it down naturally you don't have to mentally count each breath but just seeing if you can keep it nice and slow and steady maintain your focus on breathing into your stomach so it expands with each in-breath and contracts with each out breath you can visualize that your stomach is a balloon that grows and shrinks with each inhalation and exhalation you you still maintaining the pace of your breath think back to an incident where you put a smile on someone's face now you don't have to remember their names all that matters is that you made someone happy and that you did it with no thought of getting something back it doesn't have to be something major it could be something as simple as holding the door open for someone or giving a child a piece of candy or offering someone a sincere compliment that made their day now if several incidents come to mind pick the one where the recipient of your kindness expressed a genuine gratitude can you remember what they said or what they did just dwell in that memory for a few moments and try to recall as much detail as you can [Music] do you remember how you felt in that moment did the other person's reaction surprised you maybe it made you feel good maintain your even breathing but just keep that memory and enjoy the feeling I'd like you now to remember a time when someone did you a kind Act preferably one that you so badly needed but never expected now again you don't have to know the person's name or even remember the details of their face just try to recall as much of the incident as you can did it happen at night or during the day what happened just before the person or persons came along did you ask for help or did they just volunteer to help what did they do to help you do you remember how you felt in that moment did you feel surprised grateful did you express your gratitude if so how did it make you feel valued noticed no longer invisible that there are indeed good people in the world just take a moment to explore that memory and to relive what you felt still maintaining the slow even pace of your breath I'd like you to consider the following thought the gratitude you've felt toward another was the same gratitude that another felt toward you it might be a feeling of lightness and peace one where the world seemed right even if only for a moment but the person to whom you were kind they too felt what you are now feeling that the world seemed right because they were good and kind people in it people like you no matter what your situation is like no matter the state of your finances or relationships no matter the state of your health or the demands on your time and attention this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you if you but hold on to it no matter how much or how little you have no matter your state of mind or how you feel this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you if you hold on to it no matter what your country's social political or economic situation is like and how it affects you this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you you hold on to it by understanding that this is your innate nature that's why it feels so good because it's your default State this is how you came into the world and how you may have spent the first years of your life until you grew older and forgot your true nature you are not your gender nor your sexuality nor your job nor your economic status nor your nationality or political affiliation you are yourself a being filled with love with light with peace and joy you are a person who seeks happiness and miracles and wants it for others as well because you know that this is the default State for everyone your pain is the result of knowing this truth but seeing another that's why you come alive when someone shows you kindness because it reminds you of their innate nature and that's why you feel powerful and validated when you show kindness to another because it is a reminder of your own innate nature you may not be the CEO of a major company or the ruler of a powerful country but you have a power similar to theirs the power to change the lives of others and it begins with one thought that I am good and therefore have the power to demonstrate the goodness or to withhold it it begins with one act the power to sit or stand up straight and undefeated confident in understanding of your own innate goodness finally it projects itself with one simple but sincere smile one that makes you feel good and because you feel good you pass that feeling on to another changing another's day for the better by making them feel the same and when another person feels good they pass on that feeling on to another who passes it on to another and so on continuing a chain reaction that began with you so you do have a tremendous power one that could potentially affect millions and indeed change the world for the better knowing this you cannot possibly be as helpless or as powerless as you have let yourself believe understanding this you can live each day with an upright posture a kind smile upon your face and creating miracles there are millions out there whose dahi depends on you and because their day depends on you so do their lives and the lives of others let go of your limitations and accept your own power and responsibility to shape the world into a better and more positive place it first begins with you rest well my friend rest well and go out create miracles change your life and at the same time changing the lives of others [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this loving-kindness meditation prior to sleep my name is Jason Stevenson and I will be taking you on this journey though this meditation was originally used in Buddhism you don't have to be a Buddhist to make it work for you nor do you have to subscribe to any religion or belief in Supernatural love and kindness are wonderful things but often we feel anything but sometimes it's easier to feel anger and hate but author Jonathan Lockwood who he also known as the philosopher of happiness put it best when he said forgive others not because they deserve your forgiveness but because you deserve peace now unfortunately that's often easier said than done but fortunately this meditation can help you so let's begin so please sitting upright but comfortably so if you'd like to rest your back against something that's fine just don't slouch or lean back because doing so will affect your breathing and if you want to lie down and do this before you drift off to sleep that's okay to just rest your hands palms face up on your lap or or by your side if you're lying down now close your eyes and focus on your breathing it's alright if thoughts and images come in so long as you keep most of your attention on your breath you're doing fine when you see a thought allow it to be don't try and push it down but you simply shift your focus back to your breathing I want you to remember a time when you did a kind thing for someone it doesn't have to be dramatic but I have two conditions the first is that you did it without a thought of a reward or an influence to that person and the second is that you didn't later regret what you did just reflecting on that do you remember how it felt did it feel good did you feel proud of yourself did it bring a smile to your face [Music] if you're smiling now that's all good that feeling stems from a core goodness within yourself now I want you to try to remember what you looked like as a child the younger the better that child you were for all their faults and mischievousness deserved patience and understanding that child you were also deserved loved could you see yourself wanting to protect and provide for that child [Music] could you see yourself wanting to hold and comfort that child just explore this thought for a moment [Music] you you now if you can just mentally repeat after me for all the ways that I harm myself negate doubt belittle myself judge or be unkind to myself through my own confusions I forgive myself and if there is a situation I am not yet ready to forgive I forgive myself for that too may I feel loving-kindness may I be filled with loving-kindness may I be held in loving kindness may I be happy and peaceful may I appreciate the gift of just being alive [Music] I'd like you now to bring to mind someone you love dearly it could be a parent a child a friend or even someone who's passed away can you remember their faces how they move [Music] do you know why you love that person can you remember the things they did to earn your love how do you feel or how did you feel when they were around you what does your love feel like to spend a few moments exploring this [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] imagine there in front of you now and mentally repeat after me if I have harmed you in any way either knowingly or unknowingly through my own confusions I ask your forgiveness if there is a situation you are not yet ready to forgive me for I will be patient you have harmed me too perhaps knowingly or unknowingly through your own confusions but I forgive you and if there is a situation I am not yet ready to forgive you for please be patient [Music] may you feel loving-kindness may you be filled with loving-kindness [Music] may you be held in loving-kindness may you be happy and peaceful may you appreciate the gift of just being alive [Music] now please try to hold on to that love and think of someone you neither like nor dislike it could be your mailman a co-worker or simply you see someone every day but have never spoken to [Music] can you remember their faces how they move what they sound like if you've spoken to them now your love might be weakening a little at the moment try to hold on to that love you felt for the other person as you picture this new one [Music] what if you knew that this person has children they love very much children they'd be willing to suffer for would that change your feelings about them consider that they may have pain and suffering but they might also want happiness for themselves and those they love might that warm you toward them a little imagine that they could be kind to you if you gave them a chance does the thought of loving them with the same intensity still seem strange can you imagine the possibility of it could you fake it a little could you try to feel the love you felt for the other person and keep this new person's face in mind just try to explore this thought over the next few moments [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] mentally repeat after me may you feel loving-kindness may you be filled with loving-kindness may be held in loving-kindness may you be happy and peaceful may you appreciate the gift of just being alive whatever living beings there may be may they all have happy minds may I not deceive another nor despise anyone anywhere even when angry or upset [Music] may I not wish ill upon another just as the mother would protect her only child with her life even so mayor cultivate a boundless love towards all beings may I radiate boundless love towards the entire world unhindered without ill-will without enmity I'd like you to go back now and remember the person you love so much picture their faces and imagine that they're with you remember what it feels like when they're present and rest in that thought for the next few moments [Music] and now the hard part bring to mind someone you dislike it doesn't matter why you dislike or hate them but could even be someone you've never met perhaps some public figure whose blood makes you boil for some other reason if there's no such person in your life think of someone you've recently had a spat with and are still upset with I'm going to assume you've brought up someone you dislike let your emotions come but don't try to justify them simply let the experience of dislike come as your heart beat faster is a dialogue now coming into your header along the lines of I should have said this or I should have done that focus on your breathing but don't let the feelings go [Music] you I want you to imagine what this person you dislike might look like as a child long before they created whatever drama it is that upsets you so much try to create some emotional distance and imagine how they might act as a child perhaps when they were three or four [Music] visualize a small of them with a higher pitched voice and a face without whatever expression that annoys you so much [Music] [Music] could you see yourself hating this imaginary child if this child were hurt or upset could you see yourself wanting to pick them up perhaps hugging them to give them some comfort if you saw this child alone and scared could you see yourself walking away [Music] [Music] what could you see yourself putting aside your own feelings to comfort someone in the midst of their own pain and suffering [Music] now imagine this person as they are now if you saw them alone and scared far away from wherever it is you have to interact with them if you saw them vulnerable suffering and in pain and know that this is that same child you would have comforted could you still dislike or hate them with the same intensity or could you see yourself softening a little [Music] if you could see this person holding a little child tenderly perhaps comforting that child could you see yourself softening a little more could you be a little less angry or upset with such a person if you could talk to the child this person was what would you say [Music] you you [Music] mentally repeat after me if I have harmed you in any way either knowingly or unknowingly through my own confusions I ask your forgiveness if there is a situation

1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to the deserving and manifesting abundance guided meditation [Music] it is the innate tendency of nature to grow and become more to produce more and create more of everything there are always babies being born new trees sprouting new plants growing new things are constantly being invented cars produced houses being built jobs created and new technologies being developed on a daily basis all around us the universe is always expanding and growing just as abundance is everywhere in the universe it can also appear in your personal life if you intend it and allow it to be you may not feel you have access to this abundance you may think you a li innate yourself from it and prevent it from manifesting in your life well it's time to change that tract abundance into your life you need to feel abundant you must believe you are worthy and deserving of great abundance you have to develop an abundance consciousness abundance consciousness means becoming aware of the existence of abundance of feeling it in your life and of connecting with it even if it doesn't seem to be a part of your life at this moment this kind of consciousness means feeling and believing that you are a part of it you are surrounded by it abundance lives within you intending it and releasing it out into the universe is all we need to begin with abundance consciousness breaks through the limiting beliefs of your mind and opens you to wider opportunities and a wider point of view so now let's get comfortable and allow ourselves the time and space to relax and manifest abundance in our lives you so finding a comfortable place either sitting or lying down that you won't be disturbed for the next 20 minutes or so and closing your eyes your arms can be placed beside you and begin this meditation by taking in three deep breaths in through the nose sending that breath all the way down and releasing it letting it go feeling that breath rise all the way up and out and return your breathing back to normal change it just being aware of it in feeling that stomach expand as you breathe in breath out feel your stomach contract just be in this moment and be aware of this breathing for a few moments and I will return if a thought arises during this time simply go back to focusing on your breathing it's all okay it's a part of the process of meditation [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as you begin to relax now I'd like you to visualize laying beside you an envelope with a golden wax seal stamped with an ornate letter a written upon it you lift this up and gently break the seal and open the flap inside is an invitation addressed to you it reads you are invited to celebrate your outstanding contributions to the people in your life and to the world as a whole a ceremony will be held in your honor follow the illuminated pathway as you put down the invitation you notice on the floor of your room an illuminated pathway appears begin to follow this pathway and you'll notice with each step the pathway glows more intense you noticed an arched doorway appears in your room where there was no opening before walk through this doorway and run your hands over the edge of its surface as you pass over the threshold you find yourself in a very large beautifully decorated opulent room filled with silk draped tables elegantly set and well-dressed people the ceilings are high in flying buttresses reach from one side of the room to the other beautiful stained glass windows surround this space the architecture is magnificent as are the room settings take a moment to look around at this majestic room what sort of lighting do you see what are the floors made of and how are the tables set how does it feel to be in this amazing opulent space move further into this room towards the smiling crowd there is nothing to be afraid of here music plays as you walk through the room toward the crowd [Music] [Music] [Music] others in the room are looking at you proudly acknowledging you with a nod of their heads and one by one people come up to you and shake your hand or embrace you telling you how happy they are to see you congratulating you on your achievements and thanking you for all you have done for them to better their lives you recognize some of the people there are family friends co-workers loved ones from all walks of life and yet many of the faces are unfamiliar to you to continue walking through the crowd smiling and thanking them for their kind and gracious works he reached the center of the room where there is a large silk draped table covered with flowers and candles in the center of the table is a large ancient treasure chest you turn to look at the people who have all gathered around you one person you immediately recognize walks up beside you holding two champagne glasses one is handed to you this person speaks we are all gathered here to celebrate the amazing person you are and the incredible things you have done for each of us in your lifetime I know you don't know some of the people standing here but through your actions you have touched and made a positive impact on each of us it may or may not have been a direct action but somewhere down the line it was you that changed each of our lives you are an amazing person and you deserve true abundance in your life you are worthy of all the best y has to offer unlimited wealth and good health unrestrained joy unconditional love and pure peace please accept this gift as a token about love and gratitude for being a part of our lives and for being yourself in the world everybody raises a glass and cheers for you applause breaks out the crowd encourage you to open the chest and as you do the room suddenly grows silent everything stops the light changes and now instead of music sounds of nature can be heard birds calling forest sounds you turn to see that everybody has vanished and you now stand in a beautiful outdoor forest setting the stone columns and flying buttresses have been replaced by tree trunks and branches foliage and earth replaces the opulent flaws and instead of candle lights sunlight streams in all around you you are now alone in this magnificent space with a beautiful gift this wooden chest the table and all upon it have vanished and the chest lays upon an earthen pathway beside beds of beautiful flowers at your feet you've been down and lift the lid of the chest light floods out and envelops you you're reaching to the light inside the chest and you find a note it reads you the owner of this chest for all the solace acts of kindness you have bestowed upon the people in your life have earned great abundance when you close the lid tell the chest what you want if it is wealth you see speak the words then open the chest again take some time now to state to this ancient chest what you would like in your life it may be health financial abundance better relationships and abundance of happiness whatever it is set your intention and know deep within your heart with an unwavering belief that you are worthy you are deserving and by setting your intention you are activating the law of attraction and abundance to receive these gifts in universal time and so it is enjoy these next few moments [Music] [Music] [Music] when you feel comfortable in knowing this chest is a treasure chest that will change your life for the better you close the lid and you pick up the note again you continue to read this chest is your gift use it as you see fit to fill your life with the abundance you so rightly deserve place your hands upon the chest and all that you asked for draw it into your heart trust in the universe or powers and you can bring it forth anytime you wish peace love and light be with you looking to the ride you see a large tall oak tree in front of sit or lay down in the sunlight close your eyes and take a deep breath taking in the scent of the forest and the earth hold the breath for a moment and release it begin to feel your body resting upon the surface where you first began this meditation breathe in old and release know that you can come back to this meditation and activate this ancient chest whenever you desire abundance coming back now when you were ready come back fully into your body and open your eyes welcome home [Music]

observe your breath and allow it to naturally slow down become aware of your physical experience with your minds I notice first the palms of your hands notice the energy here perhaps you feel this as warmth or tingling or maybe a buzzing sensation notice how simply moving your awareness to this part of your body moves your energy to this point by simply paying attention you have the ability to

pause you can extend the gap between your thoughts this gap is where you can experience peace and calm notice now if there is anywhere you can soften a little more look for anywhere you can let go even deeper into relaxation and ease let your physical body go so that you can let your thoughts go [Music] visualize your own body resting and become aware of your own physical presence allow the weight of your body to become heavy allow your awareness to follow the sound of my voice and travel through your body now on a journey of sensation simply feel each part as it is mentioned as you remain still and relax deeper welcome all sensations you experience just as they are become aware of where your head meets the support below you allow your head to feel heavy and supported resting

teeth your gums and your tongue feel the inside of your cheeks feel all of your face now as a whole allowing yourself to relax deeper and deeper and now as I say each part of your body let your focus move to that part and encourage your release a complete relaxation to find ease in your body by simply moving your awareness throughout your body as I mentioned each part allow the surface below you to support you fully so there is no need to hold your position and you can be completely relaxed become aware of your feet now notice this area and simply relax move your attention up from your feet and begin to release your lower legs and knees feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and goes deeper into relaxation as you allow it to let go and now find the sense of ease in your thighs and hips as you let go completely moving up noticing the area of your lower back and abdomen take a deep breath to move your energy and attention here to release any tightness in your lower back continue this process of increasing your comfort by moving your attention and therefore your energy and as you do welcome a feeling of softening into your abdomen let your chest and arms rest heavy on the surface below you moving your attention upward feel as your neck and throat release any physical and emotional tension that you may be holding on to notice now the hinges of your jaw allow your jaw to unclench relaxing deeper and deeper still feel as the small muscles of your cheeks eyes and forehead soften and smooth you may notice that as the small muscles in your face and jaw let go the rest of your body follows and softens even more still now your whole body is heavy relaxed and that ease you may sense that you are safe and supported and you are open to guiding yourself into a calm state of mind let yourself go let your mind and body go to a deep and relaxed State and now that you are fully relaxed you can turn your attention inward by checking in with what is true for you since what you are actually feeling give yourself permission to experience in this present moment without trying to change anything without allowing thoughts to take over let your thoughts come and go there is no need to attach to them or follow your thoughts imagine your thoughts are like a river flowing gently downstream let your thoughts go so you can be here now make space for the truth to surface in whatever form it comes simply allow it to surface make space for awareness and acceptance without judgment whatever you're feeling is okay these are simply patterns that have developed they are not you recognize the self-talk going on in your mind and let your thoughts come and go allow yourself to move out of the thinking patterns and bring your attention to your felt experience no need to attach words or labels to your feelings simply explore what those feelings are pause and allow these feelings give yourself permission to be with this experience let your thoughts come and go [Music] if you find your mind drifting going back to old patterns of thinking or overthinking lovingly come back gesture your attention to come back to the present moment sensations once more being present is the way stay in the moment stay with the feelings and be okay with it continue to make space in your heart for these feelings to come up and simply be stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment longer as you continue this relaxed inward awareness become aware of any thoughts arising witness them as if you are witnessing a flowing river of thoughts see them surface flow by and disappear each breath cycle Rises and is released similarly our thoughts rise and are then released let this idea this knowledge be a comfort to you to allow your thoughts to drift down the flowing river of thoughts as you observe them as you let your thoughts come and go you may find it helpful to name these thoughts as they arise identify them as a way to simply be aware of thinking after they have been named witness them as one drop of water in the flowing river of thoughts moving with each of the other thoughts rising and falling and flowing away let your thoughts come and go [Music] [Music] like your breath rising and falling away your thoughts to rise and fall away no matter how many thoughts come up allow them to flow by if you find yourself following a thought or reacting to a thought bring your attention back to the sensations in your body notice your felt experience let your thoughts come and go [Music] if we resist the current of the flowing river of thoughts it will continue to rush against us pushing in opposition perhaps giving you the feeling of being stuck if we accept it allow it we drift effortlessly along with the current [Music] the awareness of your thoughts allows you to let go of the hold they may have on you continue noticing your thoughts as they arise and allow them to drift away you may even notice your thoughts coming with more space between them when you practice allowing them to rise and fall as with the cycle of the breath if you find you get swept up with a thought with compassion and patience bring your awareness back to the sensations of your body now allow yourself to go deeper still allow all of the thoughts to go let your scanning awareness drift off simply be present with your truest self letting all the layers of yourself dissolve let what seemed like boundaries blur since a place inside of you that is the place of your inner wisdom your intuition here inside you is where your present awareness and insights reside when you pause and simply be your mind stops and you open into expansiveness open into spaciousness [Music] take a moment now to open yourself up and be receptive to whatever you find here open to any messages that arise [Music] and now you have prepared your mind and your body for a deep peaceful restful night's sleep [Music] your subconscious mind is clear your

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this short mindfulness meditation to help increase your awareness of both breath and body in this present moment my name is jason stevenson and i invite you to simply follow my words of guidance as we move through this meditation and know that there is nothing you need to know and no experience you need to have in order to practice this so to begin just take a moment to let yourself come to a comfortable seated position or lying down if that's comfortable for you you can be in a chair on the bench seated on the floor or whatever is most comfortable and wherever you find yourself just take a moment to check in with your posture ensuring that your spine and neck form one straight line and your shoulders are relaxed just rest your hands in your lap your knees or your thighs and then close your eyes if you've not done so now take a few silent moments to let your mind arrive in this present moment [Music] often when we go into meditation it takes the mind a few moments to settle in to let go of its attachment to the past or its ideas about the future you can help it to arrive by simply tuning into the surface beneath you noting what it feels like to be held by gravity against the floor or the chair below you once you feel firmly grounded and connected to the earth beneath you just let your attention shift gently towards the breath without looking for anything in particular in the breath's flow simply observe its movement into and out of your body you might notice the temperature of the surrounding air as it enters your nostrils or the feeling of the body expanding and contracting with each breath cycle if you notice the mind wandering at any point simply notice this movement with patience curiosity and compassion and note that it's entirely natural for the mind to wander so practice non-judgment when you notice that this is occurring just silently invite your attention back to the breath when you notice that thoughts have pulled your attention away [Music] now i invite you to let your attention and your awareness broaden to hold your entire physical body within the scope of its lens notice what it feels like to be here to fully occupy your physical being in this moment [Music] just as was the case when you observe the breath there is nothing unusual or particular you need to look for tuning into the body is a process of simply connecting with the subtle sensations of being alive you might notice tingling tension contraction or expansion or even numbness or any other barely traceable sensations just simply notice what is here inside of you [Music] now let your attention focus in on a single sensation you may have come to observe if nothing has stood out to you simply let your awareness land on either the heart space or your third eye area just in the middle of your brows [Music] whatever point of the body your attention has landed on i invite you just to stay with that notice what is there and even if that feels like numbness or emptiness just notice be with it and refrain from judging any sensations as good or bad just watch with openness and just see what happens [Music] if or when the sensation dissolves just gently shift your focus to another single point in the body alternatively you can stay exactly where you are continuing to be present with that original point of interest [Music] now i invite you to consider is there any part of your body that might be yearning for some love or attention and let your attention on that place or stay where it is at the present and then imagine as if you are breathing nourishing energy into that part of your body with each breath so with each inhalation you might envision a gold healing light being sent to that area of your attention and with each breath out you might envision that same light carrying away any tension or stagnant energy [Music] inhale loving energy to nurture this single point in your physical body and exhale all tension away now i invite you to broaden your awareness once again slowly expanding your attention to hold your entire physical body and then continue to inhale those loving breaths or that golden light letting each breath nurture every cell of your body just imagine that your entire body each cell each muscle and each organ is breathing in and out now soften your forehead relax your belly and then slowly let all visuals fade as you come back to the natural flow of your breath and ground yourself once again in the surface beneath you and when you were ready to close this practice slowly open your eyes [Music] and as you move through your day remember that you can always come back to the immediate sensations of your breath and body to find peace presence and grounding thanks for joining me today [Music] you  English (auto-generated)    
1 [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to this short guided meditation to help you start your day on the right note by setting an intention and visualizing how you would like your day to unfold to begin this practice take a moment to find a comfortable seated position and however you find yourself seated elongate your spine as if your crown of the head is touching up towards the morning sun and allowing your shoulders to drop and your chest to open gently closing your eyes if you haven't already done so and then take a few moments to check in with your natural ebb and flow of your breathing and just notice if there's any restrictions or contraction that is inhibiting your breath from flowing into the fullness of your lungs and where it is possible for you to consciously shift this see where you might invite increased softness or surrender into your physical body [Music] you might relax the belly the jaw or your shoulders to facilitate the flow of this life force and now before we begin our intention setting and visualization practice let's just take three long deep breaths together and begin by emptying your lungs all of it and take a full deep breath into the belly for a count of four pause for a second at the top and then slowly let it go for a count of four another slow deep breath in brief pause at the top and then completely release as you breathe out one more full deep nourishing breath in and brief pause and then release with a soft sigh as you exhale and just let the breath continue to flow naturally as it awakens you to this day ahead now i invite you to take a silent moment to tune in with your heart as you reflect upon what intention you would like to set for your day it might be to move forward with courage and confidence to be loving and compassionate with those you interact with maybe to feel grounded and centered in your being or anything else that feels true to your most authentic self this morning [Music] and whatever it is take a moment to silently formulate that intention into a single sentence and then silently repeat it to yourself slowly with heartfulness and commitment and know that there is no right or wrong intention to set so you don't have to overthink it just let whatever arises from within your heart and be led by that now with this intention in mind and with your commitment to embody it in each minute an hour that unfolds i invite you to visualize your next few steps upon finishing this meditation where will you go next and what energy will you travel with there how will your body and mind feel as you move through the morning with your intention radiating out from within you picture how you will stand how you will walk what you will wear and which qualities you will carry with you and then follow your steps even further into the future what will your late morning look like your lunch hour or your early afternoon consider any interactions you will have the effortless moments the potential challenges and the simple moments in between picture yourself navigate all of these moments with grace ease and authenticity as you visualize yourself moving through the day notice how it feels to be you to be the you who lives in alignment with your highest intent let this energy embed itself in each cell of your being as you watch yourself effortlessly moving forward through the day consider next how you will transition into late afternoon and evening what interactions do you expect to have if there are any obstacles you imagine might cross your path know that you have within you what it takes to navigate these as best as can be done let your intention and the vision of your higher self guide your steps forward spend just a few final moments visualizing any important details about the day ahead and then empower these visions with trust faith and confidence in yourself and in your [Music] intention [Music] and when you are ready slowly let the imagery dissolve as you come back to your breathing watch the breath as it flows through the heart space and from the heart i invite you to silently repeat the following words i move forward in alignment with my highest intent [Music] i move forward in alignment with my highest intent [Music] i move forward in alignment with my highest intent and now just take three long deep breaths to close this practice [Music] and after that last breath whenever you are ready you can slowly open your eyes to the day and as you move forward let your intention and your highest visions empower the hours to come thank you for your time [Music]  English (auto-generated)

allow yourself the opportunity to relax in stillness create a safe and tranquil environment for yourself making sure you are all set to drift off into sleep invite into your body and mind a sense of relaxation and peace you can drift off to sleep when you are ready there is no need to listen to everything I say let relaxation and sleep come to you easily welcoming a slowing down of the momentum of your energy to gradually find stillness begin to connect with your breath and if it feels right to you take a long slow deep breath in hold it for a moment and then slowly exhale fully empty out and allow any tension to melt away as you gradually relax more and more deeply with each breath as you continue to breathe intentionally allow your exhale to be slightly longer than your inhale to welcome ease and relaxation to flow throughout your entire body [Music] take another long slow deep breath in pausing again and then exhale empty your lungs completely with your out-breath [Music] and again take a deep breath in to signal to your body and mind that it is your time to fully relax take your time hold for a moment and then let it go perhaps you can already feel yourself drifting into a deep state of relaxation like the leaves being released from the trees in the season of fall you can let go to make room for new possibilities to develop and present themselves in your life [Music] consider each breath out as a time for releasing any unwanted energies and allowing the energy that you do desire to develop within you this is your time to heal and to let go with each exhale let go of any tension in your body scan for areas that are holding on to something and give yourself permission to let go of that tension with each exhale surrender to gravity let go of any resistance [Music] with each exhale let go and soften deeper and deeper into the surface below you allow your body to soften a little deeper now allow the out-breath to exhale tension from your body we'll let go of anything you might be holding on to from yesterday or earlier today [Music] let go of any to-do list that may be taking up space in your ID give yourself permission to be here right now doing just this sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission in order to let go of the past give yourself some space space for something new space to grow into what do you want to let go of right now [Music] what has become too heavy a weight to bear on your journey [Music] like the falling leaves it's time to clear out and free yourself of things you may have been afraid to let go of in the past without the falling of the leaves there can be no new growth let go of anger let go of guilt let go of grief [Music] let go of sadness let go of judgments let go of comparisons let go of shame [Music] let go of whatever is weighing you down these emotions may have served you in the past yet now it's okay to release them [Music] offer your awareness now to your physical body in this moment scan through the sensations of your body with a relaxed awareness free of judgement surrender any tension you may notice soften any areas you may be experiencing gripping or holding allow this surrendering to happen naturally throughout your body by simply offering your awareness to your body it is okay simply breathe and notice [Music] be aware of your inner physical experience just as it is you can allow yourself to simply be exactly as you are [Music] a peaceful mental state and an ease fulfill state are available when you are able to stop resisting your experience at any given moment when we want things to be different than they are that is when we develop resistance or tension today practice letting go of resistance be here now just as you are and you can get into the flow [Music] as you notice your body sensations accept them just as they are whether you may typically label these sensations as positive or negative settle into your body except being in your body right now just as you are be with the sensations you experience accepting all that you are there is no need to make a change during meditation be just as you are accepting allows you to fully experience what is happening in the present to fully engage in life [Music] listen to what your soul is sharing with you right now continue to be receptive to these sensations for a few moments longer with love and kindness for yourself feel the lightness that has washed over you as you have shed the weight that you have been carrying around for far too long we can learn from our faults and grow from our experiences if we allow them know that without experiencing suffering we also cannot experience joy without darkness we cannot know light allowing life just as it is can lessen any struggle and perhaps any additional and unnecessary suffering continue to soften soften from the surface all the way to deep within you release any guarding you may be holding on to surrender to anything you were holding on to for fear of losing let go of what could have been let go of worry of the possibility of a new way let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders let the sensations dissolve from your muscles every day we get a new chance to be in this moment it is okay simply breathe and notice surrender to the ability of your body to heal itself surrender to the love within you know your ability to give and to receive love surrender let go and be held by pure love trust you are loved in darkness and in light all of you is loved simply trust [Music] notice once more how you feel and allow yourself to feel just as you are for an even deeper connection with yourself surrender to your breath feel your body being breathed being moved by your breath trust it's okay simply breathe and notice [Music] notice the sounds in your environment just as they are here are the sounds as they come to you without searching them out allow the subtle noises to drift into your awareness with simple curiosity take interest in the sounds just as they are simply allow the sounds to be rather than seeing them as a distraction or an obstacle if you can practice accepting the sounds just as they are without the desire to change you can also begin to practice acceptance and surrender in other areas of your life frequently the word surrender has a negative energy to it you may think of having to give up something that is important to you or lose control over a situation Surrender does not mean giving up when the word surrender is used as a mindfulness practice it can also be the opportunity to give up anything that is no longer serving you or anything that is keeping you stuck [Music] consider this beautiful quote by Debbie Ford surrender is a gift that you can give yourself it's an act of faith it's saying that even though I can't see where the river is flowing I trust it will take me in the right direction [Music] any obstacle or challenge in your life might actually be taking you in the right direction allow the flow of the energy of life [Music] when you feel life brings you challenges you can't accept you have the opportunity to be transformed by acceptance you may add suffering when you resist the way things are because they aren't the way you expect or want them to be [Music] you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the way things are naturally there is a possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true peace is available when you stop resisting any given moment [Music] although you don't have control of what goes on beyond yourself you do have a choice as to how you respond to your experience and this choice gives you the opportunity to experience in our peace you can decide your attitude in any given circumstance noticing the sensations in your body with a relaxed awareness once more since that you now feel as if the weight of tension has been lifted and released from your body you sense that you are feeling lighter now almost as if you are floating and gravity has let go of its effects on you [Music] this lightness comes from letting go of anything and everything weighing on you both physically and emotionally it has been lifted completely out of your body [Music] this release allows you to feel lighter physically and you drift into a more productive sleep to prepare you for the day ahead [Music] let go of tension [Music] let go of pain let go of negativity and make room for the rejuvenation of a deep night's sleep let this come to you easily and effortlessly in your mind here these positive affirmations as your own beliefs hear them as truth in this present moment let these statements move you towards a spiritual surrender allow these ideas to help you drift into a deep healing state you don't have to do anything simply listen and allow sleep to come easily to you eventually my voice will fade away and you will drift off into a deep healing state of sleep for many hours I am ready to release the past and move forward now [Music] I am ready to surrender and move forward now [Music] I surrender I allow I accept I surrender by giving up attachments to results

1 hello and welcome to this guided meditation on letting go and sleep my name is Jason Stevenson and I will be taking you through a relaxation before hopefully you'll be having an immensely satisfying sleep today my aim is to assist you in completely letting go and surrendering before sleep before we begin set your personal space up for this wine down to a good night's sleep put away all distracting items and power down all your devices apart from the one on which you are playing this recording you may wish to take a moment to jot down any pending tasks which can wait until tomorrow it's vital to incorporate rest into your busy schedule and with a good night's sleep you recharge your batteries and rejuvenate your spirit for a great day ahead so without further adieu lie back into a comfortable position allowing your body to adjust your mattress feel your spine settling back and relaxing rest your head back against a pillow if that is your preference and just savor the relief of simply lying back after an active day if you haven't already done so let your eyes close naturally just allow the eyelids to gently come together no need to squeeze them shut and forget for the moment about trying to sleep just inhale deeply thinking to yourself breathe in hold your breath a little and then breathe out being conscious of your breath as our breathing comes under control so too does our mind it's not about trying too hard to control your breathing instead it's letting it occur naturally and just being aware of it you on your next breath in focus on the center of your forward hold your breath permitting it to gently soothe your forehead like a bomb and relax let go on your next breath in feel your eyelids become soft and relaxed and as you exhale notice how your eyelids get heavier and heavier as they welcome sleep on your next breath in breathing in and feel cool energy to your cheeks and hold your breath exhaling feel your cheeks lower comfortably like they just drop deeper and deeper relaxed on your next breath in focusing on your jaw muscles feel your teeth come apart and your lower jaw drop slightly if the tip of your tongue is stuck to the roof of your mouth let it fall and relax next bring your attention to your neck muscles and on your breath in energy of that breath to need away at your neck taking the strain away senior Nick further on your next breath in bringing a dose of relief to your back the energy run along your spine unwinding all the knots in your upper and lower back and on your next breath out allow any tension or aches to be carried away with this strand of exhalation feel your body relaxing deeper and deeper now breathe in again and bring your attention to chest pulling apart all the knots that wind your chest up tired and breathe out and savor this liberating relief of deep and satisfying relaxation breathing in again and this time feeling your shoulders let go they drop a little and the muscles in your arms your biceps and triceps and into the forearms feel any stress in this area melt away right down to the tips of your fingers you breathing in again and sending the breath right down to your abdomen and feel it expand and contract as you breathe out just letting it sink back in naturally and sending you into a deeper state of relaxation introduce some of that relaxing energy to your legs as you take the next breath in upon breathing out let any remaining pressure escape through the tips of your toes and your outward breath you through the breath you bring balance to your system with each conscious breath you become more and more aware of the present moment very moment you simply are you are perfect you are whole just take a moment now to observe the natural flow of your breathing you notice how with each breath in your chest izes and with each breath out it falls up and down just like the steadily swinging pendulum of life you bring your attention to this precise moment to struggle or to force yourself to do this by simply coming back to your breath you will return to the moment and become aware of it just breathe in and then breathe out from the start of a new day right up to the end we are exposed to thousands of thoughts don't try to fight your thoughts simply observe them witness them and then coming back to your breath slowly let those thoughts go remember breathe in and breathe out you may find yourself thinking about a particular event or events that have passed slowing down the thought process drift among those memories witness them from above and recognize them tell yourself I'm thinking about this event I acknowledge it and as you breathe out move along with the breath detaching yourself a little more from that particular thought we must understand that we cannot change the past that we can learn something from it upon a lesson you might have learned from that event or those events again to not strain yourself to think of the lesson simply breathe in and breathe out again and if something comes to mind take it with you if not remain with the breath and you can always return for further reflection at another time breathe in and as you breathe out let the past flow through your system and out to become one with the universe sometimes we are overpowered by a sense of anger or grief and that in turn holds us back if this is the case view now if any of these thoughts arise just breathe in focusing on that breathing breathing afresh energy and on your breath out becoming fully aware of your breath in this state of relaxation your mind is operating at a slower more passive frequency you are hence able to observe these feelings of anger or grief without letting it affect you a moment now to reflect upon this did not try too hard to determine the source of it simply acknowledge its presence and then return to the breath there are opportunities to become angry and upset every now and again however it's important to remember that we have a choice of whether or not to feed these emotions and by merely coming back to the breath you can bring yourself back into alignment you can choose not to let these things bother you they are not worth your precious time if you have any anger or resentment as you inhale and exhale let them go reminding yourself that is not worth giving into you want more you are strong our belief systems can sometimes place restrictions on us however we can all make the choice to follow what we truly believe in make yourself aware of this choice through the bread inhale bring into your system that things that are most important to you bring to mind what you most value in your life and as you breathe out let go of those feelings that do not resonate with you and that hold you back from being the best version of your truest self but those beliefs go knowing they do not serve the true you in any way it may not be our beliefs but a troubling thought may linger after hours of the event in this census like a game of tennis there are times when you may lose a point but there are other times where you'll gain one the only thing to remember is to keep playing and to keep playing it's simply a matter of breathing therefore just breathe in and breathe out again there is no saying what the future holds for us to dwell on the uncertainty only brings more stress more anxiety through gratitude and appreciation of all the gifts life has offered you today be certain that tomorrow will be better reassert this on your next breath bring in all the wonders of your present life everything that you are grateful for only think of one or two things and they can be as simple as having a roof over your head or having your next meal all this breath just for a moment as you breathe out release all expectations of tomorrow let go of all control surrender and that weight of expectation will be automatically lifted here and now you are wholly present neither your past your future your troubles nor your beliefs can take this moment away from you this is the gift known as the present one that comes for all of us to embrace stay here for a moment in and out existing completely in this present moment let go of everything that is beyond your control you've done your part to the best of your abilities the rest now will be taken care of trust in life now you deserve the best and with the following affirmations you may surrender completely you can mentally repeat these to yourself I accept all the gifts that the universe has to offer me I am grateful for mirakl I find around every corner I appreciate my life by living it to the fullest I love the way I am and believe in my abilities I am totally free I choose to do things that make me happy I fully deserve to be happy I am loved and loved fully I am the best version of my truest self I am fully present in this moment I welcome wealth and abundance into my life I now surrender that which is beyond my control to the universe this is your final passageway to a rich and abundant sleep you've come a long way in accepting your present and letting go of that which has held you back you've worked hard and the sleep that beckons is fully deserved hold more miracles and blessings than what yesterday did expect the unexpected and surrender any pre-existing notions about the future just let them go focus now entirely on the breath and let it carry you on to your slumber follow your own natural rhythm breathing in and out and in your mind's eye visualize a trap door that opens up ten steps covered in thick crimson carpet that easily muffles your footsteps leads downwards to a pleasantly lit place of peace I will count you down from ten guiding each step that you take 10 take the first step holding onto the golden rail you are reminded of the soothing balm of your breathing 9 letting go surrendering eight going down deep Oh seven breathing in and out drawing and closer to a blissful sleep six five

1 [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's time to let go we seem to spend a lot of time in our minds thinking about past events worrying about the future and oftentimes these intensify just as we rest our heads on our pillow to go to sleep let's now release this if you catch yourself worrying thinking thoughts that don't serve you for this moment simply bring your attention without any fanfare or concern back to your breathing or back to focusing on this meditation and this is your meditation you create your own rules with this meditation and your rules may change each time you listen to this meditation recording taking in three deep breaths in through the nose and out through your mouth releasing concerns thoughts of the day worries just letting them all go and they had just pass a byes they aren't you they come into your consciousness and you allow them to float on by once you've done this go back to your breathing regular breathing whatever is comfortable for you just with an easiness [Music] allow yourself to drift at any time into whatever realm of consciousness you choose [Music] see yourself now entering into the deep dense Amazon rainforest over two million miles of lush greenery rainforest that is filled with hundreds of billions of individual trees although somewhat dark up ahead you see the sun shining peering through trying with all its might to come into full being in this majestical place be with the sounds of the forest for a moment and hear the abundance of insects birds and animals and even the plants seem to add their own gentle vibrations to this enormous space breathe into this become one with this as you breathe the forest breathes with you if during this time your mind wanders and you become aware of this just gently

1 tonight I have a treat for your bedtime routine clear the clutter of your mind slow down the momentum of your day and sleep peacefully the practice of meditation is about returning your attention to the present moment with acceptance and kindness for what you find it is about coming back to the present when you find yourself going down the rabbit hole of worrying thoughts the more you practice the more skilled you will become both in the practice as well as in everyday life meditation before bed is a wonderful way to quiet the raising thoughts and positively prepare for the day ahead today I will guide you to practice this skill to help lessen the level of stress and worry so that you can experience a tranquil deep sleep hello and welcome I'm Sarah Raymond from the mindful movement thank you for joining me today here we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mind set and heal from the stress that's blocking your fulfillment now I invite you to make yourself comfortable take a moment and make sure your environment is all set for you to drift off into sleep it is important for you to have the sense of safety so you can fully relax make sure the room is dark all screens and electronics are off and you are as comfortable as you can be if you are listening to this on electronic device turn the screens light away from you create the most comfortable environment you can pause this recording if you need a little more time [Music] we will start this meditation with your eyes open gently although your room is probably dark focus your gaze softly on one point a spot on the floor or the wall or perhaps just a sense of color in the darkness [Music] narrow your focus to this one single point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away let your focus rest on this one point stay with this narrow focus for a moment then as if this one point could get even smaller begin to draw your focus in until your eyes gradually closed and you allow your attention to turn inward [Music] invite your thoughts to do the same narrowing inward letting the momentum of the day gradually slow [Music] be patient with this process of slowing down [Music] when your eyes fully closed and your attention turns inward bring your awareness to your breath [Music] begin to count the length of your natural breath in and as you breathe out encourage your exhale to be one count longer than your inhale allow each long exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress or tension [Music] by exhaling longer than you inhale your breath will slow and your body will calm down continue lengthening your exhale for a few breaths cycles letting go of the counting if you like and simply sense the full exhale [Music] know that your breath is an anchor or a reminder for you to come back to the present moment if you find your mind wandering or find you are distracted by sounds come back to your breath you cannot get back a breath from your past nor can you make a future breath come any sooner than the present moment [Music] in this gradual process of slowing down you may still have thoughts going through your mind simply notice them and let them move on as you come back to your breath [Music] as you focus your attention on your breath approach this meditation with the intention to simplify and to slow down allow your body to soften and your breath to be calm if it feels right to you as you breathe in imagine that your breath has a bright white color to it and it is filling you up [Music] and as you breathe out this white light is taking with it any physical tension or feelings of worry [Music] [Music] take a long slow deep breath in through your nose [Music] move this breath all the way down into your abdomen filling you up with light and making space then allow your body to surrender to the weight of gravity and relax as you exhale [Music] breathe out anything that no longer serves you on your journey to simplify [Music] each full breath clears out the clutter and relaxes your body and mind even deeper inhale the bright white light exhale let go deeper and deeper allow my voice to be your guide into relaxation you can drift off to sleep when your body is ready [Music] and your subconscious mind will continue listening and relaxing even further like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down in relationship to each breath as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts [Music] invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen be in the gap no need to do anything simply be in this space [Music] in a moment now I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the top of your head going all the way through your body to your feet as I say each part of your body see this part in your mind's eye [Music] and you can relax that body part completely [Music] welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind [Music] encourage the weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface below you so that there is no need to hold on you can simply let go into sleep now as we begin to scan the body bring your attention to the top of your head [Music] intend to feel this area from the inside of your body as sensations only [Music] without moving your eyes as you scan your body simply move your awareness to each part [Music] and as your awareness flows throughout your body you can relax each part completely [Music] let's begin this relaxation process by noticing your scalp [Music] moving your awareness to your forehead as it softens [Music] notice your right eye [Music] and your left eye [Music] and that your awareness rest on both eyes together sensing the small muscles surrounding both eyes relax completely [Music] notice your right cheek since both the outside and the inside of your cheek the right side of your gums and the hinge of your jaw noticing now the outside of your left cheek and the inside your gums and the end of your jaw on the left no noticing both sides together allowing your awareness to relax you even deeper since your right ear [Music] noticing the inner ear and now your left ear [Music] the outside and your inner ear that your awareness rest on both ears together and now moving your attention to notice the right side of your neck and the left side of your neck [Music] notice the front and the back of your neck and since the entire circumference of your neck sensing now your right shoulder right upper arm right elbow and forearm right wrist and and fingers [Music] and now your left shoulder upper arm your left elbow and forearm wrist and and left fingers [Music] and now since the length of both arms hands and fingers together [Music] noticing the right side of your chest your ribs your abdomen and back and the left side of your chest ribs abdomen and back [Music] now both sides of your trunk together as they soften and that go into relaxation moving your awareness now to your right hip down to your thigh your knee and your lower leg sensing your left hip by [Music] knee and lower leg and now begin to sense both legs together notice your right ankle the top of your right foot the bottom of your right foot and your toes moving your awareness to your left ankle on top of your left foot the bottom of your left foot and your toes and then since both sides together continuing to relax slowly complete one more scan of your bodily sensations from your head all the way down your body as you do breathe into any areas of remaining tension to completely let go going deeper and deeper into relaxation [Music] [Music] feel that your mind and body have slowed down you have let go of thoughts you have let go of physical and emotional tension from your body as your body softens you can make room for your thoughts to dissolve into spaciousness your body relaxes and your mind can unwind you can clear the clutter of your mind [Music] now that you are calm and deeply relaxed imagine a scene in nature with a waterfall this can be a place you have been before we're an image from a photograph or video or purely imaginary whatever comes to mind is fine [Music] in your mind see this waterfall see how quickly the water moves over the edge flowing freely here the sounds of the rush of water going over the edge and splashing down below notice the momentum of the moving water [Music] below the waterfall the water is flowing into a river the water here moving a little slower yet there is still much momentum carrying the water away this river moves the water into a lake where the water is much calmer and eventually comes to stillness [Music] on the far side of the lake you can see the still water appearing with a glass-like surface reflecting the surrounding scene [Music] like the movement of the waterfall flowing into the river and into the calm lake your energy and your thoughts can slow down and just illness invite the slowing of the momentum of your energy from the day past the slowing of your thoughts in your mind [Music] imagine your thoughts are like a leaf floating in the water being moved from waterfall to river to stillness in the calm lake [Music] when you hold on you fight the current let go and drift effortlessly into peace that the current carry you away to sleep [Music] let go of any thoughts of worry any thoughts that might be holding you back from experiencing tranquility thoughts holding you back from sleep see these thoughts drift off in the flow of water they will be there when you need them in the calm state of your mind let go of your worries so that you can sleep peacefully now [Music] what you resist persists [Music] they acknowledge your thoughts with acceptance without the need to follow them off into story [Music] meet your present experience with permission [Music] allow your thoughts to come and go without resistance welcoming a calmness to wash over you completely [Music] [Music] and now you have prepared your mind and your body for a deep and restful night's sleep [Music] a new sense of calmness is emerging as thoughts come to mind you allow them to drift off in the current not to disturb your calm state with this warm sense of comfort you can now begin to drift off into a deep relaxing sleep you will sleep so well knowing you are ready for what the next day brings you are so incredibly relaxed your mind feels smooth and there is an inviting sense of inner peace flowing through your body you are ready to rest your mind for the night you are in the perfect place to get the best night's sleep [Music] and you will wake up tomorrow feeling rested and calm like the still water of the lake [Music] you are relaxed and feel a sense of lightness and spaciousness as you have let go of anything weighing you down [Music] sleep is inviting you to let go and surrender to your dreams allow this to happen if you wish take the final steps into a deep restful slumber your body knows exactly what to do to relax and allow during your very productive deep sleep as you drift off into serene peaceful rest my voice will gradually disappear and you will be deeply asleep [Music] when you wake hours later you will be energized rejuvinated and call [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to the magic book series guided meditation visualization I'm Jason and for the next 20 minutes or so just make sure that you cannot be disturbed switch off your mobile phones and close your eyes and as you close your eyes you feel every part of your body in contact with the chair or the ground you can feel every fiber of your body soften relax release picture the room around you the way it would look if you opened your eyes feel the sunlight all the darkness the warmth of the room the softness of your clothing against your body if any thought or tension from your day appears just smile at it and let it drift away when you return from this journey you will remember exactly what you will need to and only the truly important matters will be waiting for you when you come back this is your chance to let go of your day to sink into a deep sense of relaxation and serenity and to explore the hidden adventures of your own subconscious mind [Music] [Applause] [Music] as we move through this meditation continue to breathe deeply and notice the sensations that come up in your body releasing thoughts and anxieties as they come up enjoy the feeling of just being here in this moment bring your minds are into the room around you and as you picture your surroundings look closer at the wall nearest you see the hazy outline of a door appear notice its texture perhaps not at dark oak or a sleek blond wood notice how it is becoming more real more concrete [Music] now imagine standing up from your chair or reclining position and walking towards that door reach out your hand and touch it feeling it's cool solidity now grasp its handle and give it a gentle tug opening it to reveal a staircase leading upwards you cannot see what's at the top of these stairs but you know deep inside that it will be something calming and pleasant [Music] take that first step up the stair feel your feet against the stairs treads worn from so many years of use grasp the handrail and continue climbing up the stairs each step you take relaxes your body more and more causing you to breathe deeper and release any tension that may be hiding in your muscles at this moment [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] as you begin to get closer to the top of the staircase visualize the warm sunny light emanating from the room beyond it feel its gentle warmth against your face increasing as you get closer and closer to the top of the stairs breathing deeper and relaxing more fully take two more steps and you've reached the landing you're in a library of sorts with tall ceilings and enormous glass windows outside of the glass you can see fluffy white clouds moving across a cerulean sky watch them pass for a moment slow and graceful wisps against a calm blue background feel the glow of the sunlight against your eyelids in front of you is a soft upholstered chair with a small table next to it walk towards it noticing all the bookshelves you pass and the colorful intricately embossed spines of the books that reside there know that they don't matter right now as the book you need to read is already waiting for you resting on that little side table just ahead when you reach it sink into the chair feel its softness how it supports your back your neck your shoulders right where they may be aching exhale all this pain and tension and inhale breathing in total calm feel how easy it is to just dissolve into this chair releasing any thoughts that you've been carrying with you until now exhale deeply feeling entirely peaceful in this quiet serene place once you are ready pick up the book on the table next to you it is small bound in royal blue leather its title is stamped on the front in gold leaf just above a delicately embossed pattern of stars look a little more closely at this title sensing these golden letters rearranging themselves until you can read what they say this book is called relaxation run your fingers across the cover feeling the pebbly texture of the leather and the slight indentations of the embossed pattern know that when you open it you will be taken someplace new someplace totally calm that you can return to at any time you will be totally safe and will return to the library feeling even more peaceful than you do right now with that in mind open the book and see the printed words watch as they run together and grow until all you can see is the texture of the paper and the text getting larger and larger surrounding your body like a warm gentle bath watch the characters dissolve slowly but surely until you can feel yourself standing on a grassy hill you are surrounded by night sky and the white pin pricks of stars [Music] [Music] [Music] inhale smelling the sweet scent of night blooming flowers and growing grass feel a soft breeze across your skin look upwards at the sky inky sky and the way the stars resemble tiny pearls at the bottom of a dark ocean breathe in this night air notice the way it swells into your lungs totally absolving you of any tension in your body inhale deeper and enjoy the sense the breeze carries to you listen to the crickets chirping the occasional sleepy call of a now simply breathe it all in and exhale any thoughts or worries that surface in this serene landscape if you become distracted bring yourself back to the details all around you the breezes gentle caress the trees whispering in the wind the fresh scent of grass and soil when you turn around you'll see the twinkling lights of a city somewhere in this city lies an object that will help you attain total and complete relaxation do not worry your senses will guide you right to it so in a moment turn around and soak in the side of glimmering lights in the city below notice how the lights mirror the stars like a reflection on a still lake a glimmer in the night sky and the town's lamps below Sparkle creating a landscape of almost unending light the whole valley and sky is filled with gentle dancing brightness breathe it all in letting your senses absorb the quiet twinkling of the stars the breeze and the plants and animals around you feel how soft the soil beneath your feet supports you letting you stand totally comfortably and view this scene savor the way the breeze brushes around your skin washing away any cares and tensions like water [Music] [Music] know that you can return to this hill to this very spot anytime you wish as you observe the valley below you bring your attention to your feet planted on the ground underneath them there is a pebbly path just in front of you made from small white river stones it leads down into the valley and fades into the distance somewhere beyond the city you know that this path will take you exactly where you need to go and so as you begin to walk down it you feel any tension melting away left behind on the hilltop feel the way your feet press against the cool smooth stones the way the pebbles give way like sand notice the city lights getting closer as with each step you take tension dissolves and you relax more completely keep walking enjoying the sights and sensations surrounding you welcoming you to this peaceful place [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now that you're close to the city you see that the Whitestone path continues through it leading you through brightly lit streets and dimmer alleyways it flows over any obstacles that may be in your way keeping you totally safe and guiding you towards your ultimate destination as you pass houses and storefronts smile at the sounds of conversation and laughter inside their walls but do not worry about speaking to any of the inhabitants you may return another time and explore the nooks and crannies of this city but now you are drawn almost magnetically to what awaits you at the end of this path if you encounter figures or thoughts from your day know that they accept this and will happily await your return another day the white stone path continues onwards through the city every step pulls you closer and closer to its end where an item waits for you this object will be uniquely personal something with significance to you but do not worry about what it might be before you discover it know that whatever this item is it will help you attain peace and relaxation in both your meditation and waking life so as you feel yourself pulled along this path release any ideas about what this object might be or what it might mean breathe deeply inhaling the soft night air and gentle lights of this quiet city you are now leaving the city continuing out into the countryside beyond the lights notice how much easier it is to see the stars out here feel the way the soft grasses brush against your legs as you continue on this pebbly path breathing deeply and releasing any cares you may be still carrying you can see an outline of something a little further ahead something at the end of this path as you approach it you see that it is an old well and on it hang as a small lamp flickering slightly in the gentle night breeze approach it feeling the way the path pushes you towards it when you reach this well stand a moment and notice the sturdy time-worn stone although it has been here for many years everything is still in good repair when you are ready grasp the wells handle and turn it lowering the metal pail that hangs on it down into the ground there are a few small bells tied to the rope notice how they tinkle merrily as the pail descends happy to help you along your journey take a moment to enjoy the sounds of the sleeping valley around you [Music] continue turning the handle until you hear the pails splash as if it's water once it does exhale releasing your expectations along with your breath inhale turning the crank the opposite way to bring the bucket back up to you when the bucket reaches the top of the well there will be something inside it for you something to help you remember this feeling of total calm so when you are ready reach your hand in and pull out whatever lies inside it what is it hold this item in your hands feel its weight its texture its temperature notice how relaxed you feel totally devoid of any tension or anxiety in your body slip this gift from the valley into your pocket and carry it with you knowing that anytime you feel tense or stressed you can touch it and be instantly transported back to this state of calm [Music] [Music] now reach your hand back into the bucket and feel your fingers curl around something else something solid and rectangular withdraw it from the bucket the blue and leather gold embossed pattern glint in the moonlight this is the magic book you read before ready to take you back to the library when you are ready take a moment to look around you notice the Stars and the glimmering lights of this city savor the sounds of the wind and the nocturnal animals the way the cool white pebbles press against your feet smile at everything you encounter when you are ready open the magic book and begin to read watch the words on each page grow small and smaller multiplying until they fill your vision when you can no longer see the valley or the light they dissolve and you find yourself sitting back in the South upholstered chair all ivory [Music] feel the weight of the object you found in your pocket and know that you can always carry it with you set the book in your hands on the table beside you and take a moment to reorient yourself within the library when you are ready stand up and look around know that the blue leather book will be resolved waiting for your return in precisely the right spot bid the library farewell walk toward the flight of stairs when you reach the stairs grasp the handrail and begin your descent each step you take brings you closer and closer to where you began your meditation closer and closer to full consciousness [Music] continue walking noticing how although you were getting closer to the bottom of the stairs your sensations of relaxation and serenity only increase when you reach the door at the bottom open it and step out into the room where you were before approach the chair you are sitting in and sit down enjoying the tranquility your time in the valley has brought you smile at the thought of all the other adventures that awaits you ready for exploration any time you feel like returning to the library return your consciousness to your physical body begin to wiggle your fingers and toes waking up the parts of you that rested while you were meditating when you are ready open your eyes breathe and smile you are now ready to enjoy the rest of your day [Music] [Music] [Music] you

1 hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will help you to visualize yourself achieving the weight loss or physique that is of your highest intent my name is jason stevenson and i invite you to open your mind and this meditation will help to inspire you to achieve the physical body that feels perfect for you and to help you sleep well to begin this meditation just bring yourself to a comfortable resting position and ensure that all end-of-day activities are taken care of and that you are fully supported by whatever pillows or blankets you might need close your eyes if you've not already done so and just take a few moments to ground yourself through the natural rhythm of your breathing you don't need to change the breath in any way yet for now simply let it flow in and out as it yearns to be in this moment considering it to be an anchor for your awareness notice what parts of your body rise and fall as you breathe as well as any other physical sensations that you observe [Music] now softening the belly and seeing if your breath might naturally deepen as you shift your awareness further down into your body [Music] and i invite you to imagine each breath extending beyond both lungs and belly to awaken each and every cell of your being let each and every inhalation breathe itself into your whole body with each of these full body breaths imagine that every in-breath brings vitality and aliveness to your cells and that each breath out frees you of stagnation or lethargy so feeling into the stillness yet radiant vitality of your body in this moment and now before we move into a visualization to help us manifest our greatest aspirations for the physical body let's take some time now to hone our attention on specific energy centers within your body as we draw our attention through the body we will awaken the major energy points within it that help us to achieve this new physical reality so begin now by drawing your attention to the base of your spine to the root of your being with your awareness held here at the root chakra let each breath in fill this part of you with a renewed sense of connectedness to the physical world to the earth beneath you and to your very own body you are grounded connected and full of vitality now let your awareness shift slowly to the navel as you hold your attention on your core let each breath in create an expansion here filling you with confidence will power and determination to achieve your dreams you are strong resilient and empowered let your inward gaze now move away from the core as it lands in the heart space in the center of your chest and as you hold your attention here on the heart let each breath awaken your sense of self-love and unconditional worthiness you are loved worthy and wonderful and slowly now shift your awareness to your third eye to the center of your forehead and just slightly higher than your brow line and as you hold your awareness here let each inhalation awaken your capacity for inspired imagination as well as your ability to intuit what your body requires in any moment you see and believe in your highest potential you know what your body needs and now allow your attention to land on the crown of your head the top of your head let each inhalation rise to fill this part of your being and as it does allow it to fill you with a deep connection to the limitless energy of this world whatever you require to achieve the physical state you long for the universe can provide it you are connected supported and ready for transformation now let your focus open up as you come back to full awareness of your body now in your mind's eye i invite you to envision that you are standing on a warm and sandy beach gazing across azure blue waters and behind you staggering amber cliffs rise up towards the sky the contrast between the bright blue waters and this rich orange earth is mesmerizing you revel in the beauty and wonder of this space and as you turn back towards the sea you take a few moments to ground yourself into the place that you occupy through the soles of your feet you ground yourself into the soft sand and earth that supports you that provides you with vital earthly energy [Music] and through the crown of your head you connect with the limitless potential of the universe your mind is beginning to expand to let all possibilities filter into your awareness [Music] the upward moving energy from the earth meets with the downward moving energy from the cosmos landing in the center of your heart and grounding you in love these energies meet in the heart to ensure that all actions you take are rooted in and reflective of self-care self-kindness and self-love so take a few long deep breaths as you harness the energy above below and all around you and after your last long exhale let the breath come back to its natural rhythm as you envision yourself moving down the coastline how you move down this beach is entirely up to you perhaps you walk with grace run with strength dance with full expression or move in some other way that your body feels called to move in whatever mode of movement helps you to feel strong and stable in your body envision yourself flowing effortlessly along the sandy beach before you you are deeply attuned to the needs and wishes of your body in this moment note what it feels like to move in this way take this time to observe what feelings and sensations arise how does your body look as you move how does it feel to move with strength confidence and agility spend just a few more moments allowing yourself to move in a way that inspires you until soon the beach begins to narrow as it reaches its northernmost end [Music] from where you stand at the tip of this beach you realize you have two options to go back to the place you started at or to venture onwards and up you choose the latter and so you decide to climb the rock face that leads gradually up towards the peak of these majestic cliffs you follow a small foot trail that takes you a few meters up from the beach and that is where the work begins step by step you make your way up the mountainous terrain with confidence and strength your body is fully engaged and your mind is radiant and alive with each step you take you shed any and all limiting beliefs that hold you back from achieving your fullest potential your body too sheds any excess weight that no longer serves you or it builds the muscle the natural strength that you have long been yearning to cultivate perhaps it does both you feel and empowered to achieve the perfect body for yourself you are beginning right here right now notice how it feels to exert yourself in this way to absorb the energy of the earth the sky and the sun and to propel yourself forward with vitality you are fully alive relish in what this feels like soon the incline decreases in intensity as you approach the highest plateau of the cliff face as your movements slow and require less of your energy you come back to the rhythm of your breath breathing slowly and deeply you take your last few steps towards the highest lookout point of this mountainous terrain from where you stand you can see the shoreline extending for miles and miles and the sea drifting into the horizon the water azure blue by the shore slowly fades into a deep and mysterious darkness you are in awe with the beauty of this landscape as you gaze out across the ocean you realize that anything is possible you see this infinite world of possibility reflected in your own mind and spirit confident in your ability to achieve whatever it is you long for and with your feet grounded in the rich earth beneath you you stand tall and strong fully grounded in this body that carries you through life a deep sense of gratitude for your physical body moves through you and so you thank it for its wisdom support and resilience you take just a few more moments to gaze out across the vast sea below you and as you turn around to find a comfortable place to rest your body you were surprised to find a mirror has appeared from seemingly nowhere it stands on the pathway that leads down to the grassy valley below slowly you make your way towards the mirror mindful step by step and as you reach it your eyes widen at the reflection you see in the mirror it is your perfect self a glimmering you embodying a physical body that makes you feel alive confident and radiant take a moment to scan yourself in the mirror admiring the perfection of your physical form and notice the way you glisten and then deepen your gaze as you focus in on what radiates out from within your confidence your happiness your vitality and aliveness you are supremely beautiful both inside and out just take a few more moments to revel in this radiant image of yourself knowing that this self will move with you even when the mirror is gone you feel confident to step away from it for now and as you pass it by taking the pathway that leads down to the lush green valley below feel a deep sense of self-appreciation warmth and tenderness rise up within you you sense that your mind spirit and body are in full alignment now and so you are ready to rest deeply for a while [Music] your feet carry you to a bright valley and there you find a picnic blanket and a place to rest your head for a while you lower yourself down to the earth resting flat on your back as you gaze up at the blue sky and scattered white clouds thinners cotton above you the sun has disappeared from your view slowly departing for the day to grace another place on this earth hours pass by and soon the sky transforms to orange and purple and then to a deep midnight blue the full moon rises and the stars too and as you gaze up at these planetary neighbors you feel called to set an intention to commit yourself to nourishing and supporting your physical body and all the ways it yearns to be cherished take a moment now to set this intention for your physical appearance and well-being in your words in your mind repeating it to the cosmos three times in silence the stars continue to glisten reflecting the beauty and radiance that is very much alive within you and soon your eyes grow tired your body heavy you scan your body from head to toe letting each body part you pass surrender into the supportive earth and as you close your eyes to the night the visualization of this natural landscape dissipates you come back to the place that holds you by feeling into the supportive surface beneath you just let your entire body relax slowly surrendering completely into sleep you may use your breath as an anchor once again to keep you grounded and present and simultaneously i invite you to allow the following affirmations to fill your consciousness and as they do they will continue to inspire your physical transformation empowering you through positive beliefs so let go of all effort now as you allow your subconscious mind to take these affirmations in i am beautiful confident and radiant my body is healthy and happy i look and feel my best i embody my greatest physique i am in control of my physical well-being i treat my body with love and care every day in every way my body becomes stronger i nourish myself through food and exercise i am empowered to achieve my fitness goals i find joy in

1 [Music] sleep well a guided meditation sleep talked down it's time to get comfortable now this meditation is best done lying down and preferably in bed prior to wanting to go to sleep so begin by closing your eyes having your hands placed beside you and taking in three deep breaths breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth really take deep breaths here and letting go of all the tension of the day on the breath out and after you've done this bring your breathing back to its natural rhythm not trying to change your rhythm just being aware of the breath coming in and going out with each breath in fill your body relax and loosen a little bit more and with each breath out feel the tension of the day melting away your body becomes supple and relaxed deeply relaxed [Music] whilst you are beginning to relax know that soon sleep will come you do not need to strive for it to obtain it you just need to listen to my voice as I guide you towards it naturally and without effort if any thoughts come into your mind during this meditation that's perfectly normal it's okay for this to happen we are thinking beings and so we think thousands of thoughts a day what I ask you to do is simply observe the thoughts without attaching to it and in their own time allow them to melt away whilst you focus back on my voice or to your breathing now make sure you are lying comfortably and if not change your position now even just slightly make sure that your body is evenly balanced your hands out to the side and mentally check right now for any tension throughout your body poor posture or day-to-day stresses can make you hold tension in various parts of your body it's time now to just let it all go focusing on your feet move them a little and tense them hold that tension and now let them go shake any tension free just allow them to fall naturally tighten up your ankles and calf muscles then your knees squeeze it all tightly hold and let the tension go really really relaxed this part of your body do the same now for your thighs hips and buttocks tighten then stretch out and release just let go as though this part of your body is just melting through to the floor [Music] now tighten your back and your stomach area tense hold and release all this tension let it go if you feel any tension here that seems to be deeply rooted you can repeat this again now move onto your arms tightening your arms shoulders and neck muscles hold and release let go make sure that your jaw is relaxed let your tongue rest against the roof of your mouth and your lips be open slightly we often carry tension across the scalp and forward to just breathe in and exhale and visualize the muscles relaxing at will and again breathing in and on the breath out see your facial muscles just relax systematically working your way through your body in this enables you to eradicate tension and allows our muscles to relax it enables you to embrace deep sleep as it happens without worrying about it it becomes a routine a positive behavior that leads naturally towards sleep you just have to let go of everyday problems and learn to empty your mind doing this form of meditation practice can help you to let go of everyday problems by focusing on other things and it helps release thoughts old thoughts negative thoughts unwanted thoughts for the day when these thoughts come up simply always keep coming back to my talking or your own breathing if you struggle to stop the bombardment of thoughts infiltrating your mind or find that you constantly try to solve problems the moment you lie down instead turn your attention to your breathing inhale and count the breath in for four seconds hold the breath for four and then exhale for a count of four this can work wonders take a slow deep breath breathe in and feel the breath filling all the way up from the diaphragm and all the way up to the top of the lungs now exhale slowly and feel the diaphragm deflating and tension starting to dissipate now repeat this do this again and this time on the breath out visualizing tension and anxieties leaving your body every time you exhale find me one more time breathe in deep breath in and let it go now imagine yourself standing in a cavern at the top of some ancient steps the steps have been carved into the rock face many years before and although you were inside with the roof of the cavern being too high to reach you feel a cool soothing breeze coming up the steps it's a narrow set of steps but you are longing to know what is at the bottom as you are ready to settle down for the night know that you will be safe as you walk down them and it is a part of your journey towards deep and undisturbed slumber strategically placed torches with golden flickering flames light the way down the steps casting an orange glow this late hour [Music] as you progress down the steps know that you will become more and more relaxed trail your hands down the rocky walls as you progress downwards one step at a time slowly and steadily listen to the sound of my voice but allow the sensations of the moment to filter within visualize the texture of the rock beneath your fingertips feel the slightly warm but textured surface beneath your bare feet you feel a part of nature and a part of history of this place you feel timeless sensations now step down again you feel peaceful you are relaxed and you can let go of any anxieties you may be holding on to step down again you are truly relaxed you feel safe and secure here step down once more notice the blue shimmering light flickering at the foot of the steps intrigued you keep moving downwards you are so relaxed each step takes you nearer to this fluctuating colored light feel relaxed absorb the sense of peace in this place [Music] [Music] as you make your way down to the bottom step and emerge from the cavern you realize that you are now outside at the bottom of a cliff but have emerged in the most beautiful and quiet secret place there is a small pathway ahead of you stepping stones that neatly interlock and guide you towards a platform surrounding by sparkling waters that glisten under the velvet night sky the sound of water trickling over tiny stones is soothing you pause to enjoy these sounds for a few moments [Music] [Music] as you walk along the pathway your feet bear against the warmth of the stones heated by the earlier Sun you see that the platform is small and partially covered at the sides with a pliant willow frame adorned with honeysuckle and jasmine climbing up over filling the air with the subtlest of sense stretching across the platform but looking further out to see a hammock ideally placed for the most relaxing nighttime experience take a moment now to climb into the hammock it is easy there is no difficulty at all here it is welcoming and as if it's designed just for you you slip comfortably into place and feel it support your body in wait you have never felt so relaxed you feel wonderful you feel at peace you feel at one with nature bill your body becoming heavy you are sinking into the hammock you are so comfortable up above you the night sky reveals millions of stars dotted overhead and around you the sound of water is making you so relaxed so very relaxed the moon sends a silvery glow revealing a purple expanse of sky peace floods through your being let all

against the platform and the trickling over the stones and the shallows is soothing your eyelids are becoming heavy you sink further into the hammock feeling warm and sleepy let it happen give into

1 [Music] [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided sleep meditation this is a meditation that is not only good to help you sleep you may also find it a tool to help with lucid dreaming as this is another way of entering that incredible state between wakefulness and sleep our minds and bodies are like children and the more we ignore their demands the more they demand our attention so if sleep eludes you then you could be possibly ignoring some demand from your body and your mind the solution there for us to pay attention to them but on your own terms not theirs and that can start with this sleep meditation it's based upon yoga nidra which literally means yogic sleep so let's begin and please lie on your back and keep your arms away from your body with your palms facing up allow your legs to naturally fall apart so that they're not touching each other if you're using a pillow make sure it doesn't elevate your head too much so that it restricts your breathing just a nice comfortable place so your back is as straight as possible but not held rigid now I'd like you to close your eyes and pay attention to your breathing inhale exhale inhale exhale your breathing should be as relaxed and as natural as possible with no significant pauses between each inhalation and exhalation now you don't have to make any attempts to keep your breath even your job is to simply breathe as naturally and comfortably as you can and pay attention to each in-breath and each out breath during this meditation you may find your mind wandering and that is normal our minds do wander your job is just to simply gently bring your focus back to your breathing or to my voice let's begin this beautiful process of a an internal mental massage if you like and to bring you into that deep state of yoga nidra so please take a few more breaths and let's begin relax the top of your head now letting go of any tensions you might be feeling there relax your face and all your facial muscles and just bring your mind to your forward and let it smooth itself out relax your eyelids your eyes and the fleshy part around your eye sockets let go and relax now your upper and lower lips but keep them together relax your cheeks from the top of your cheekbone all the way down to your jaw line allow your jaw to sag and let there be a slight gap between your teeth relax the fleshy part beneath your jaw from your chin all the way down to your neck release any tension at the top of your neck and let that feeling spread down to the base of your throat and bring your attention to the back of your neck let it go relax its entire length from the top where it meets your skull all the way down to where your shoulders begin relax your shoulders and let that feeling spread outwards to your shoulder joints the armpits and the space between your shoulder blades let them all sink deeper into your bed relax your upper arms let them become heavier and feel that heaviness seep down to your elbows and into the soft inner flesh opposite your elbows relax your lower arms feel that heaviness seep into your wrists into the back bony part of your hands and into your soft palms just allow that heaviness to fill your knuckles pushing out any tightness discomfort or pain that you might be feeling in them relax your fingers and all the joints of your fingers let your fingers curl or fall wherever they will just allow them to be relax the sides of your chest and let that feeling spread toward the center and relax your solar plexus and let that feeling spread down to your stomach the sides of your stomach and around to your lower back relax and release your hips your thighs your groin and your buttocks now relax and let go your upper legs and feel that heaviness use down your knees and to the back of your knees relax your shins and the fleshy strip that lies beside them let that heaviness now use all the way down to your ankles relax your heel your instep and the top bony part of your feet relax the knuckles of your feet your toes and every joint of your toes paying attention to the fleshy pads at the tip of your toes and even feel them relaxed as well feel the heaviness within your toes within your toe joints and within the knuckles of your feet feel the heaviness within the top bony part of your feet the heaviness within your instep and your heel and feel

heavier darkness of sleep and dreams if so then good night and may your dreams be joyful and pleasant or you can choose to remain here in this in-between state here there is only your breath and your mind here there is only the heaviness of total surrender and complete relaxation your body is already asleep but still receptive to any command you may wish to give it notice your breath and your body's response to it as you breathe in feel your body expand and rise with it as you breathe out feel your body contract and sink with it inhale your body expands and rises though the heaviness remains and exhale your body contracts and sinks deeper into heaviness inhale you expand and rise exhale you contract and for yoga nidra is a warm peaceful and comforting ocean in its waters your body finds the rest it needs to begin its healing process all of the day's worries stresses and pains are washed away in its deepness so here there is only restfulness peace and regeneration in this sanctuary there is only the wind of your breath and your breath is the tide of your life inhale and life fills you exhale and all your stresses worries and pains are blown away let the tide of your breath work with you and for you for you are your breath and your breath is your life you are not your body relaxed heavy and still in the state of sleep your body is only the vessel by which you anchor yourself to this world the puppet by which you create the drama you call life just as you fill this vessel with your in-breath only to empty it out again with your out-breath so you can choose what you bring into your experience into the drama of your life what you create you can uncreate and what you begin you can end in this state between waking and sleep all resistance ends there are no obstacles here no barriers no constraints and no impossibilities except what you deliberately choose in this state there are only infinite possibilities infinite choices and infinite power so choose

journey through life let your eyes drift shut [Music] this is time for you time to let your mind soften and catch up with your body this is the time and the space for you to evaluate what you are carrying with you and what it is time to release do not let yourself worry about anything now your only task at this very moment is to pay attention to what is happening in your body and mind and to dissolve into total relaxation feel your breath your chest rising and falling take a moment to thank your body for all of us done for you today if any pain or tension stands out to you at this moment take a deep breath and exhale it out removing this sensation from your body continue doing this inhaling fresh pure air and exhaling any thoughts or tensions from your day feel your ribs and belly as you breathe savor the heaviness in your limbs as they relax letting gravity hold you in its gentle embrace envision your place in this room where you are in relation to the objects around you now focus your mind's eye on a nearby wall or flat surface and watch as a door materializes slowly as if emerging from a heavy fog in your mind's eye allow yourself to rise and approach it reach out and run your hand across it noticing the texture in history of the material it is made from when you are ready grasp the door knob or handle and pull it open revealing a staircase behind the door [Music] at the top of the stairs is a place that feels familiar and saved here even if you do not remember visiting it so at this moment take a hold of the stair rail and begin your ascent up the stairs knowing that what awaits you is something with great healing power with every step you take you feel any cares and worries of the day for behind you they will be tidied up and organized and only the important ones will be waiting for you when you come back so right now free yourself of whatever baggage you might be carrying and observe the sensations in your body as you climb the staircase the closer you get to the top the nearer you get to a warm golden light you are nearing the landing now and as you take the last step breathing deeply he find yourself in a library large windows look out onto white wispy clouds and an intensely blue sky you can feel tension melting away simply being in this place taking in the shelves of our navy bound books and the gentle sunlight allow yourself to take even deeper breaths breathing in the center of well-loved books and the total peacefulness of the room ahead of you is a soft comfortable chair feel your feet carry you towards it and allow your body to sink into the upholstery let your breath wash out as you feel all the stress fading away dissolving into the fabric of the chair you are totally safe and totally comfortable in this place next to you lies a small book bound in forest green fabric when you are ready pick it up feeling the tiny ridges of the fabrics weave know how this book has been waiting for you patiently hoping for your presence here in the library as you hold it in your hands observe the way the letters appear and rearrange themselves on the cover forming themselves into two simple words letting go [Music] [Music] know that when you open this you will be taken something you have never been before someplace calming and totally safe when you return to this chair you will be lighter and totally at peace free from any suffering or fear you may carry with you at this moment so when you are ready open the book and see the words run together faster and faster absorbing you into a warm bath of language watch them grow larger filling up your field of vision until you can see nothing but the rush of letters and now they're dissolving leaving you standing on a large rock near a tranquil stream [Applause] breathe

wonderful to be leaving all of your problems below as you walk cast a glance down at the small room below see many boxes large and small all of them filled to overflowing with your problems your anxieties and all of your regrets feel a sense of relief as you climb higher moving away from all the chaos the clutter and anxieties below with each step you move towards peace and inner contentment you are now approaching the top step and an inky blackness greets you as you emerge onto a circular Ward platform you note that the sky forms the roof and there are millions of stars twinkling in the black expanse there is a sudden rush of freedom feel the sense of wonder and horror as you look towards the Hamill's [Music] in the middle of the pure-white curved platform there is a circular flat seat sloping back into a contoured chair made out of the same marble as its surroundings sit and feel the coolness of the marble beneath you it is a perfect seat for reflection and you lean back feeling the stone supporting your back in the most perfect places it's as if it was carved with you in mind imagine that you are now looking up at the night sky there are no clouds to mask the Stars and they provide you with a vastness that is appealing a way to escape the tensions of everyday life in real life you may feel tense frustrated and even trapped by life's confinements but as you look up now into the depths of this extraordinary sky dotted with stars millions of stars light-years away you feel a sense of desire to float up high and to become one with the universe to feel weightless to gain a new and inspiring sense of perspective feel yourself begin to float gently out of the marble seat you move up even higher twisting your position around so that you can look around as you float higher you float up above the marble walls and now you can see the view of the city around you lights the twinkle far beneath the expanse of sky the view is magnificent you can see for miles the landscape lit by twinkling lights heralding the existence of those who live and share this reality with you a cityscape that comes to life with the sprinkling of artificial lights that mirror the heavens above you move effortlessly relishing in this feeling of freedom here you are cast afloat from the problems of daily life it is like flying but with no effort required a single thought enables you to change direction at will and you travel on you look down moonlight is reflected in the rippling waters of the estuary gentle waves lap at the shore and as you float out further high above the darkened waters boats Bob along the harbour walls and the feeling here is of complete peace and tranquility you feel invisible there is no blame here no regrets just or at being able to see life from a whole new perspective traveling over the estuary you head along the coastline scaling large cliffs flying high above them thin wispy clouds almost transparent from below are blown in from the sea hugging the cliffs as you move higher the clouds wrap themselves around you like gossamer threads the clouds wispy fragile and translucent follow in your trail as you saw ever higher rising vertically now higher and higher looking up towards the moon silvery gray the moon is for you marvel at its beauty and power knowing how it controls the ebb and wane of the tides he is suddenly life seems less complicated there is a sense of pureness of mystery and yet clarity life is good life is wonderful and you share a sense of connection with the universe breathing deeply and then release the breath letting go of any tension within your body instead focus on the softness of every muscle feel yourself loose relaxed and free from burden far below you low flying birds hug the surface of the water disturbed they seem tiny and fast moving the water ripples gently sparkling stars and the light from the moon Herald your way you see the world from an enlightened viewpoint and it is one of wonder here high above the fragmented clouds you feel a part of the world's mystery connected on every level and free from your problems you can sense a change around you gradually the air becomes warmer and misted as cloud formations begin to forge together the sky changes color dark muted through to light and for a while the Sun and Moon share a place in the heavens he dropped down now through the fluffy clouds thicker now and float down towards the Earth's surface you feel exalted as the see now mirrors the changing skies sparkling sunlight glinting across the surface and shimmers of blue you drift down moving on away from the water's edges still high above the city's architecture tall concrete pillars and homes reaching up towards the sky and small private residences alone surrounded by small patches of green like a complex jigsaw of life stone and irregular shapes all fitting together in an almost seamless ease marvel at how the man-made structures can look beautiful too here you can see that life is about living and not holding on to problems there is no place in your life anymore for anxieties that make you feel ill tension headaches regrets that nor away that cue or the decisions that you just can't make here in this weightless existence you realize that you can be free from all of the negative aspects of life no longer shackled by an existence that holds you back this acknowledgement is meaningful it has the power to change your life as you breathing deeply conjure up the image of those problems and all of the boxes that you left behind initially they were overflowing threatening in their power to hamper your life to impact you at every turn now picture them reduced in size no more threatening just minor inconveniences now that you have scaled them in your mind shrink the problems smaller still breathe deeply again and then out breathing out the last of your connections to those problems and visualize them growing ever smaller minut a fraction of their former size and you realize that your perspective was clouded before your judgement of center your realization of the truth in life and the importance of nature and your place in the world makes those problems seem insignificant by comparison [Music] focus again on your breathing inhaling as you open up the chest exhaling as you breathe out it is time to see the problems of life as mere obstacles it is time to look to the important things in life and to step away from any doubts regrets or anxieties that affect you negatively it is time to feel contentment and to embrace pure inner peace drift gently now down to earth close your eyes and feel your descent you are at peace with life and with yourself finally you understand your part within the universe drifting down bathed in golden light as the Sun shimmers in the early morning sky the faint warmth is comforting a beautiful start to the day it is time to feel positive about your life you have the power to do so you are centered you retain the feeling of peace and wonder you are now back in your own reality imagine that you are back in your bed comfortable safe and secure open your eyes and stretch out your muscles breathing deeply to send oxygen around your body realize how good you feel right now keep experiencing the wonderful sense of calmness and deep peace as you remember your wonderful high time above the clouds a part of the midnight sky and then a part of the early morning transition as night became day understand now that your problems are such a small part of time and space and even within your own reality understand that your problems can be dealt with quickly and clearly with clarity of mind breathing deeply and keep your sense of peace and tranquility breathe out slowly noting that no tension remains remember that you can return to this meditation whenever you need a renewed perspective you are one with the universe [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to wisely let go of any anger you might be experiencing before sleep when held onto anger can inhibit us from feeling into our innate sense of peace and our capacity for compassion and so by becoming mindful of this emotion and addressing it thoughtfully we can loosen its grip and uncover a new way forward so to begin this bedtime meditation take your time to get settled in for the night ensure that your spine is long and straight and your neck becoming an extension of it and then allow your limbs to relax and fall however they are comfortable close your eyes as you turn your attention inwards and then note what it feels like to be held by the surface beneath you what does it feel like to be tethered by the weight of gravity what does the mattress or other surface beneath you feel like against your skin without judging your experience see if you can simply become more intimate with the physical space you rest in and once you feel grounded and completely connected to the physical world i invite you to shift your attention to the air around you you might notice the sensation of it against your cheeks or you might observe the way it slowly enters and exits the body as your breath as each breath fills you you're provided with life-supporting oxygen offered to us by the plant kingdom and with each breath out we return this gift to the plant life in the form of carbon dioxide spend a few moments with your breath now noting how effortless this exchange this flow is see if you can allow the chest the shoulders and the belly to soften facilitating the flow of the breath and perhaps inviting it a little bit deeper now as we dive into this process of releasing the energy of anger it is worthwhile to begin by softening out judgments of this emotion in and of itself anger is neither good nor bad it is simply a reaction we experience to various circumstances or events in our life what we do with our anger is another thing when left to fest inside or when released mindlessly upon those around us anger can hurt more than it heals however we can also choose to use anger as a signpost for what we value for the direction we wish to move in our lives only when we begin by softening our judgment and opening to this experience with more care and curiosity do we enable ourselves to discover a new way forward so right now i invite you to take a moment to draw your attention to your heart space the center of your chest and as you breathe envision the heart expanding energetically with each breath in and softening its toughest barriers with each breath out with each breath that moves through the heart imagine your judgments of this emotion relaxing as you create more space for it to unravel in a healing and a cleansing way if stories about rightness or wrongness come to mind simply note these as they appear and then release with an out breath for example if we notice ourselves feeling righteous or holding on to the wrong doings of another we might invite these to soften if only just for a moment and this does not mean you'll not be called to take certain wise action in daily life but for now harboring the energy of this anger is likely of little benefit so continue to come back to the breath again and again as needed expanding as you inhale and softening or releasing as you exhale before we move into the visualization that will help us to cleanse any held anger for the coming night i invite you to mindfully inquire into the energy that lives beneath your anger the energy that this anger arises from sometimes our anger comes from the mind as a yearning to be right or as a defensive reaction other times it arises from our values from care and concern about someone or something and even sometimes it's a mix of these two things a blend of mental and intuitive responses to the world around us so i invite you to take a few moments to compassionately curiously and non-judgmentally inquire into the energies beneath or behind the raw experience of anger and just hold yourself gently as you explore this noting to what extent you might be reacting in defense and to what extent this emotion may be rising out of love when you awaken into another day you can use this self-knowledge to help you navigate your anger in a way that is conducive of deep healing on an individual and collective level but for now let's take some time to just let it all go to reaffirm that in this moment we are well that in this moment we can best serve ourselves by inviting our anger to dissolve so take a moment now to come back to your breath for a few cycles use the breath or the body as an anchor for your attention any time you find your mind wandering that does not serve you in this moment just bring it back focusing back on your breathing and once you feel centered i invite you to bring your attention to the creative capacity of your mind and in this space begin to visualize that you are in the midst of an autumn forest surrounded by trees with leaves turning amber mahogany gold and crimson the forest floor beneath your feet is a path of densely packed earth a thin layer of early autumn leaves lays sparse signifying that the turn of seasons is upon you the air is cool but you are dressed warmly for the evening the sky is still a pale blue but you can tell by the glimmer in the trees that the sun will be setting soon before making your way along the path that leads you through the woods you take a moment to plant your feet into the earth reaching the top of your head towards the sky above your heart opens your shoulders relax you take a few long slow deep breaths to ground yourself into this calm and soothing forest you allow your forehead to soften your jaw to unclench your belly to relax and all unnecessary tension to soften and following your next breath out you decide to move forward to venture deeper into the transitioning woods you have arrived in step by step you move along the pathway that guides you through the colorful enchanting landscape the air is crisp and earthy cleansing you with each breath that moves through you small forest critters scurry across the earth and and birds chirp from their cozy nests snuggled in the trees as you admire the harmony of life here in the woods you feel yourself surrendering to it opening up to this moment exactly as it is any weight you've been carrying upon your shoulders begins to lighten guided by the energy of the falling leaves any judgments frustrations concerns or worries that you've been harboring also find their place in the forest dissolving from within your body as you harmonize with the environment around you the woods are at peace inviting you to find that tranquil space within yourself as well though the forest is not immune to the challenges of life but now it embraces the harmonious transition from day into night you carry on just a short while before the forest begins to thin and as it does your jaw drops at the radiant beauty that emerges glimmering back into your eyes a silent still pristine lake surrounded by the vibrant foliage of the forest comes into view treading lightly towards the water's edge you find a sandy stretch of shoreline and allow yourself to take a seat from where you rest you admire the reflection of the trees and the still surface of the lake the perfect mirror image softens your heart calling you deeper into the mystery of the world the reflection reminds you that we are all mirrors to one another that everything we face has something to show us about ourselves or about the nature of the world see if you can feel your mind softening as you reflect upon this sinking into the silence that holds it all and now as you sit here by the lake you hold yourself and the world in a full embrace without desiring to change anything about this simple moment see if you can open yourself completely to what is the frustrations the judgments anger that you've experienced as being a part of the world now begin to feel distant here amidst the autumn trees and silent lake you are granted with the time and space required for you to process all of those inner energies you trust that as you process them new possibilities for more wise and loving steps to take in days to come will present themselves to you as you gaze out across the water you realize there is nothing that needs to be done in this moment but to continue allowing yourself to surrender and so you lean back allowing your full body to nestle into the sandy shore beneath you feel yourself fully supported here on this small beach by the lake as the sun seeps behind the tree line the orange pink glow of the night radiates throughout the cosmos bringing a warmth to your being and as you rest here you take a moment to inquire with your body about any areas of tension or residual anger that may be longing for your attention drawing your awareness to the crown of your head to begin you slowly scan the body downwards consciously relaxing or inviting a loving breath into each area you pass when you're finished tending to the entire body come back to your breath filling yourself with cleansing crisp air of the surrounding woods that hold you your inner eye is still open to the night sky you watch as the colors deepen soon transitioning into a dark and deep purple the crescent moon appears as do thousands upon thousands of shimmering stars with your entire body relaxed breathe mindfully through the heart space inviting the universal energy of love to fill you on your next breath in and offering your inner love back to the universe on your next breath out and as you gaze up to the night sky take a moment to offer a few silent loving words to yourself grant yourself permission to feel as you feel while bathing yourself in words of love and patience and care and kindness [Music] now i invite you to repeat the same for someone or something that may have stirred anger within you in recent days and note that this doesn't mean that you need to make right the actions of another it is simply an invitation to where possible send love and care and patience to that which sparks anger within us when you are finished come back to your breath noting how it causes your body to rise and fall as you rest in the silence of this night let all thoughts and all images within the mind dissolve now there is nothing else that needs to be done slowly your eyes begin to close to the cosmos above you and the lake before you your mind's eye becomes clear and you feel your body once again tethered to the physical reality you rest in you take three long slow deep breaths releasing with the sigh as you exhale and when you are finished with those three breaths just allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and as you move deeper into the night you let yourself go completely getting the past and releasing the future all that matters now is this present moment as well as the energies of love and care curiosity and tenderness and so you allow yourself to be here to be bathed in these soothing energies as you drift into the restful slumber that awaits good night my friend so so hmm hmm [Music] so um hmm hmm so foreign so um hmm um so hmm so foreign hmm [Music] hmm so um hmm hmm foreign so so hmm hmm so so hmm um [Music] hmm foreign hmm hmm foreign so hmm hmm [Music] foreign so uh hmm hmm um hmm um hmm you

relax and your mind soften preparing you for a deep and restful sleep if you feel you need to roll over during this meditation let yourself do so this is not the time to try to force your body and mind to your will now is a chance to let go completely and enjoy the sense of peace and safety that only sleep can bring so as we begin this meditation let go of any preconceived ideas of what falling asleep feels like and simply let yourself drift through the sensations and ideas you encounter breathe in and exhale let your breath flow in and out of your lungs relishing the sound and sensation of air against the inside of your nose when you listen a little closer you begin to realize how the air you breathe sounds like the ocean washing over a beach covered in white sad imagine the palm trees growing on the edge of this sand let yourself smell the delicate scent of tropical flowers feel away a warm breeze brushes across your cheeks blowing through your hair ruffling your clothes above you fluffy white clouds float past and you can hear the chatter of birds off in the distance take it all in letting yourself sigh out any stresses of the day as you begin to notice the sights and sounds around you you start to sense where you are you are laying on your back drifting slightly with the sound of the tired and your own breath as you begin to notice this gentle rocking motion you realize that you are floating on your back in the turquoise waters of a tropical ocean even as you realize this you feel totally peaceful secure in the knowledge that no matter what happens you will not sink instead you can float here on your back without any concerns or judgment you are totally safe with each inhale and pull of the tired you feel the warm water around you laugh at your tensions and fears melting them ever so slowly each new inhale melts some of the worry keeping your muscles stiff bringing your body closer and closer to the gentle nurturing pull of the ocean feel the tired warming your fingers and toes dissolving the tension from a long day's work notice the way your limbs float and move with the tempo of the sea around you you are like seaweed fluttering gently in the soft in the spool of the current and your own breath allow the turquoise water reach your knees and elbows bringing warmth to achy joints as you continue to breathe deeply listening to the sound of your own exhalation and the oceans tides around you allow the water to encompass your shoulders and hips supporting you from below the ocean supports you from your head to your toes allowing you to let go of the force and willpower necessary to maintain your daily lifestyle here in this ocean you can let yourself melt into the water drifting drifting where it takes you and not worrying about the end result as you take your next inhale the water reaches your shoulders and belly feel the way the grip of stress and tension evaporates at the touch of this calm warm water let your concerns float beside you for a moment but then allow them to dissolve into the salt water your thoughts have served you well today keeping you attentive and responsible despite all this they too need a chance to rest so give them this opportunity to do so let yourself drift along noticing how less and less of the tension surrounding your remains every breath you take melts the thoughts and concerns around you until none are left you are totally relaxed every muscle in your body loose and pliable take a moment to just enjoy the way it feels the way your fingers flutter in the ocean's current like the tentacles of a drowsy jellyfish as you relax more fully allow the water to pull you out father to see every breath you take touch you further from the shore and deeper into a sense of serenity and the calm you are floating in a warm gentle sea with absolutely no concerns as you pass thoughts from your day or worries about your future feel the way the water around you draws you onward these tensions

wherever you please trail your fingers through the water feel the way there pressure against the surface of the ocean leaves little ripples behind you let your hand drift underneath the water for a moment and enjoy the way the tide pulls it water undulating past your skin let the sea wash through the hair at the nape of your neck erasing any tension you hold there feel the way your body Bob's up and down slightly as you pass through small soothing waves allow your eyes to drift upwards and notice how the Sun is beginning to set the sky is beginning to turn color scarlet streaks appearing against bright blue as you watch daytime sky begins to fade giving way to a brilliant mixture of pinks reds and oranges the Sun begins to drift below the horizon a regal sphere returning to its own place of rest as it sinks lower inky blue joins the brighter colors soothing and calm while you continue breathing you notice that although the Sun has gone down the ocean around you remains warm and gentle rocking you gently across its surface in fact the darkness around you leaves you free to enjoy the relaxation and aimlessness the water brings instead of noticing the science around you you focus on the sensations in your limbs let yourself drift further if any thoughts or ideas come up allow the current around you to wash them off observe them without worrying as you drift further and further into the distance let the concerns you leave behind relax to notice the way they sink into the warm comfort of this tropical sea you are cleansed of thoughts of worries of tensions now you have the complete freedom to let your mind and body relax as you rest in this soft current if you notice yourself becoming distracted visualize the stars above you watch the way they seem to move as

weigh down your body mind and spirit before we begin take a moment to let go of the need for this meditation to have a certain outcome perhaps you will fall asleep during this recording or maybe you will emerge so deeply relaxed free of all stress that it feels like you have had a wonderfully restoring nap the outcome does not matter all that counts is your carefree exploration of serenity you are here in this moment it's yours to embrace so taking in a deep breath now breathing in through your nose hold it for a second and release slowly releasing all the stress and tension through your nose or mouth and another breath in breathing in through the nose filling your diaphragm hold and release let go notice the way your body feels after this deep inhalation and exhalation do you feel any tension or pain in your body are you alert tied content just give yourself a moment to reconnect with your body which may be subservient to your brain during your waking life [Music] [Music] begin now by returning your breathing back to its natural rhythm nothing forced nothing strained it just is what it is and when you are ready notice yourself beginning to feel a little heavier the way you might feel if you spent the afternoon laying in the Sun or when you've taken a long soak in a hot bath your eyelids begin to droop slipping further away with each breath take this opportunity now to make sure everything is in order before we truly begin this meditation if you haven't already set an alarm and you need to do that just do that now and make sure your cell phone notifications are silenced and the top lines are drawn [Music] give yourself now permission to embrace the sensations in your body however comfortable or tense they may be do not force yourself to change anything but it be spontaneous and easy do not need to strive to succeed here in this place and in every place you are perfect just as you are each of us is perfect and each of us needs a little work let this realization seep into you replacing anything you worry about with a calmness that permeates every fiber of your being [Music] whatever you are feeling can change and you have the power to feel just the way you want to this is you here in the moment and you do not have to be perfect to be magnificent meditation is a journey just as sleep is a journey and you do not need to concern yourself with reaching any fixed destination instead enjoy each breath each soft inhale and exhale as you find yourself drawn deeper and deeper into a relaxation more profound than you could have ever hoped for allow all your thoughts from your day begin to melt away replaced by a sense of effortless calm even though thoughts may appear in your mind's eye they do not stay long but just allow them to float by to dissolve leaving you in a heightened sense of peace and gentle awareness they are just like dust washed clean by the rain disappearing under the gentle touch of your slow inhale and exhale everything you are worried about from the profound to the everyday drifts away leaving you an increasingly soothing state of tranquillity [Music] if any other worries arise during the course of this meditation you may simply let them dissolve away leaving you cleansed and refreshed this is time for you three from the concerns of everyday life just use these next few moments now to simply be focusing on your breathing breathing in and out in your own natural rhythm thoughts may come and go and simply allow them to drift on by no need to be connected to anything [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] as you feel your body growing heavier more restful and your thoughts softening into a quiet chatter in the background your imagination comes to life visualize yourself standing in a meadow on a brilliantly warm sunny day wildflowers of all shapes sizes and colors punctuate the soft grass butterflies some small some larger flutter from flower to flower some way off you hear the contented buzz of a honeybee pleased with an afternoon of pollen gathering the soil is soft under your bare feet warmed by the Sun above your head fluffy white clouds Scud across a bright blue sky your heart feels warm filled with gratitude and love for this place even though you have just arrived you are safe here and you are happy take it all in [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the air is warm and the Sun is gentle on your cheeks you feel loose relaxed let yourself sink down into a reclining position your back cushioned by the lush green grass underneath you a butterfly floats overhead moving on to a nearby flower feel the soil underneath your back smell the flowers the grass the dirt all around you see yourself looking upwards watching the clouds move across the sky they to calm you loving your body into an even deeper tranquility if you can imagine your body falling asleep in this mirror growing heavier more relaxed your spirit may not want to sleep yet and that is okay perhaps you want to envision your spirits standing back up even as your imaginary body falls into a deep and restful stillness [Music] and now let your body slumber for a little while as your spirit continues its journey into relaxation your body will rest right here entirely safe entirely secure until you are ready to return to it no harm will come to you during this meditation with this in mind turn your eyes to the horizon at the edge of the meadow you can see a leafy green band of trees standing Sentinel the majestic guardians of this sacred space in your heart you know that there is a tree there's that is taller and larger than the others far more ancient than those that grow around it you feel inexplicably drawn toward it connected at a deep and spiritually significant level you begin to walk towards the edge of this meadow allow yourself to move towards the forest following the path that appears at your feet and leads into the trees as you approach they grow taller and taller in your vision beginning as the size of your smallest finger in the distance but soon towering over your head with a calm wisdom that permeates your entire being as you step under the canopy you feel any stress or strain you're carrying begin to loosen falling away in the same way dried leaves fall from the boughs of the maple in autumn everything you let go of drifts away disappearing already decomposing into the soil that will nurture the trees here for years to come [Music] the sunshine here is less bright dappled and soft instead of its usual brash gold the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to and yet it is a soothing coolness filled with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss all around you stand the trunks of trees and saplings some tall and smooth others old and knild there are younger trees too skinny and gangly as they grow towards sunlight let yourself sense the slow determination of these trees anchored by roots as long as the tree is tall the trees are content to simply be here calm and strong against the weather they welcome you into their presence greet you as one just as ancient and wise as they are [Music] [Music] as you breathe deeply watching the sunlight meander back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze bring your attention back to your spiritual self the tree sense that there is something you still carry with you a mental or emotional weight that troubles you even in this place it is safe to understand it here perhaps you are mourning the end of a relationship or struggling with a relationship that exists now maybe you are tired after a long journey toward a still unreached goal perhaps you worry about money or health either for yourself or for someone else you might carry guilt or regret bitterness or perhaps even hatred [Music] whatever appears does not make you evil but is a sign of yourself outgrowing something that once used to fit there's no need to judge yourself here but instead calmly regard whatever appears in your mind and spirit [Music] let whatever this may be surface within you and when you have looked at it from every angle imagine as a handful of mud materializing in your hands as you look at it a breeze appears drying it out turning it to dust blowing it away from you into the trees your palms are clean and no trace remains of this worry or concern in your heart [Music] feel the way the sunlight darts about moving with the fluttering leaves but also heeling wherever your soul may be hurting first the wind cleansed you of any emotional pain and now allow the Sun to heal you whatever may be aching [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you continue your walk down the path hearing the distant chatter of squirrels and the occasional chirp of birds the path leads you onwards as you take in the sounds sights and smells of the forest drawing you onward until you reach the oldest tree in the forest this particular tree has a trunk so large that a cave has been carved out within the middle of it a perfect place for quiet reflection and contemplation its bark is smooth with a goldish sheen and far far overhead the leaves dance in the breeze with an almost silvery tint this tree is tall taller than any of the others taller than the tallest building you have ever seen you sense its benevolence the warmth with which it welcomes you invite you into its magnificent cave deep within the girth of its trunk except its invitation you begin to enter the cave knowing you are completely safe although it's somewhat dark there are lit candles within already illuminating the inside of this ancient tree your soul grows light or with each step as the cool darkness of the woods gives way again to the healing candle light within the cave helping you to relax deeper almost instantly you feel calm wiser and safe you feel an old familiar feeling a serenity that you have not had for such a long while from the cave you can see out to the entire forest witnessing the bobbing leaves of the other trees nearby and a squirrel scampering about far off in the distance a brightly colored swath of grass and flowers catches your eye it is the meadow and you can see your physical body resting totally and completely on this blissful summer's day allow yourself to enjoy the tranquility of the cave and the view of the forest feel a breeze into the cave and ruffle your hair and watch the Magnificent scenery around you from this position you can understand and see anything you like stay here peaceful tranquil for as long as you like and if you would like allow your spirit journey back through the forest and back to the meadow where you sink down beside your physical body a washing piece and restful contentment [Music]

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this back to basics guided meditation for beginners in the next few minutes your delve into meditation with me as your guide this recording is designed for anyone new to meditation but it also provides an opportunity for anyone to return to basics and rediscover the heart of their practice many of us have a very fixed idea of what meditation is perhaps you may see someone sitting cross-legged on a pillow and chanting or even refusing to speak for days at a time although these techniques and practices can deepen your understanding of yourself and the world around you they do not necessarily define meditation but simply meditating is becoming attuned to yourself finding peace and stillness in the midst of a hectic world it's an intensely personal experience and soon you will find yourself developing habits and preferences for your own practice for right now though allow yourself to release all of your expectations for what you will encounter in the next few minutes and open yourself to a world of infinite possibilities when you are quiet and contemplative any mystery can reveal itself to you [Music] we will begin by relaxing if you have not already situate yourself in a natural relaxed position many people like to meditate seated in a comfortable straight back chair feet firmly resting on the ground with hands placed gently in the lap you may prefer a different position perhaps you would like to try listening to this recording laying down or with your feet crossed whatever you do find a comfortable posture and let your eyes drift closed fill your ribs and belly as you breathe savor the heaviness in your limbs as they relax letting gravity hold you in its gentle embrace you can feel every fiber of your body soften relax and release now as we continue through this meditation let everything be effortless and easy continuation of your physical presence give yourself permission now to stop planning expecting and reacting just for a little while just be brave in [Music] and exhale as you breathe you will begin to notice areas in your body that feel tense or uncomfortable on your next breath in imagine your breath as a white light or cool breeze feel its surge through your body touching the places where you carry tension or pain then as you exhale this tension follows your breath out of your body leaving you more relaxed than before [Music] take another deep breath in and sigh it out feel your shoulders softening the corners of your eyes smoothie and your belly relaxing [Music] with your eyes closed the world outside may seem sharper notice this and then direct your attention back towards yourself notice you're breathing without trying to change our daily routines are busy and we spend much of our lives focused on things outside of ourselves deadlines tasks and other people's reactions can fill our consciousness leaving us no room to be still and peaceful bringing your attention to your breath is one of the fastest and simplest methods to bring you into sync with the present moment if thoughts or concerns from your day crop up acknowledge their presence and let them pass you by when you emerge from this meditation you will remember everything you need to do so there is no need to grab on to any thought right now this is your time to be light and relaxed free from the demands of daily life allow your breath to be your focus as you slip into a deeper state of peace and comfort [Music] some Meditation Center on imagining certain scenarios or sensations when you feel ready you can pursue them but just for right now allow your own feelings to rise up inside you be attentive and listen to what your body mind and spirit are trying to show you paradoxically letting go of all expectations is what will bring you a deep sense of stillness and open you to your own inner wisdom [Music] breathe in and out let your whole be exist in the present [Music] with every inhale you sink deeper into a state of relaxation and stillness this is the heart of of meditation [Music] give yourself a moment to recognize the feelings within you and then return to your breath [Music] listen to the rhythm of your breath and the sounds of the world around you observe them with detachment letting thoughts and sensations flow through you as easily as water runs over pebbles feel a deep sense of calm and develop you in the next few moments allow yourself to simply be in this space [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] begin to bring your awareness back what do you feel right now have any realizations or insights presented themselves to you notice the way your body feels perhaps light and refreshed or still and calm familiarize yourself with the sensations in your body mind and spirit and know that you can revisit them anytime you need or want to and so holding these sensations in your mind and body begin to recall your fingers and toes gently wake up the parts of you

1 [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to this healing space guided meditation over the course of the next few minutes we will travel together into contemplative silence and then open the doors to any feelings you may be holding inside yourself offering them a safe way to emerge and be released as we begin make yourself comfortable settle in and begin to listen to the rhythm of your own breath allow the music to carry you deeper as you begin this journey into your own mind and spirit [Music] [Music] begin to let go of the thoughts that appear in your mind jockeying for attention they are bright and exciting but they will lead you off the path of relaxation and into the arena of problem-solving you spend so much of your waking life problem-solving like a matador against a never-ending series of balls he do not need to do this now this is your chance to be quiet soft tranquil as you feel your breath flowing through your lungs oxygen transported through your body by your blood let your breath flow through you dissolve any energy blockage or muscle tension it encounters along the way [Music] [Music] [Music] as you find yourself relaxing more deeply muscles softening and bones resting easily let your mind's eye open and your imagination take flight on your next deep exhale you are sitting beside a river legs crossed and hands resting on your knees palms up it is night here and the sky and the water of varying depths of black despite this you know that you are absolutely safe here and that as long as you continue breathing and listening to this meditation nothing bad can happen to you so take this opportunity to follow your breath even more closely feeling every minuscule change in your lungs as you inhale and exhale [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as thoughts come up look them in the eye smile and give them permission to leave you they bow to you and promise that if you need to speak with them again they can be caught up at a moment's notice they do not want to disturb you during this time for you so allow yourself the freedom to tend to them later this space is a space for your healing and total surrender to relaxation and awareness embrace it now [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] and now bring your mind's eye back to the night around you the dark water ahead of you feel how there is no danger nearby as you are protected by your own subconscious mind and the benevolence of the world surrounding you you are absolutely safe with this in mind let your imaginary eyes adjust a little further into the darkness and begin to notice the variations in the night the places where some of the deep blue or black a lighter than others embrace the silence and feel the tranquility that comes with it in this space your hands rest on your knees palm up they are receptive to whatever emotions arise in yourself a feeling good or bad appears in your heart and as it does you begin to notice a paper lantern hovering just above your palms growing slowly less translucent as you become more familiar with the emotion within you let whatever you feel fill your consciousness passing through you and into the lantern without judgment or fear feel fully but let yourself feel without thinking allowing the emotion to be within you but not about you Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] there is a candle nestled within this Lantern and as you allow this emotion to flow through you a small flame appears with your every breath it grows a bit stronger until a cheerful tongue of flame illuminates the paper that shelters it from the wind no matter how an emotion affects you it is beautiful and unique just as this lantern is exquisite in its simplicity take a moment to say thank you to the wisdom this feeling has brought you as you carried it along your daily journey these past weeks or years feel gratitude for it slight well-up in your chest a warmth radiating from your heart outwards and then when you are ready whisper goodbye as the lantern begins to lift away from your palms it floats higher bobbing gently in the breeze as it floats upwards stopping high above your head its candle flame is golden against the inky night sky the light rippling on the surface of the water admire it for a moment and then return to your hands as another lantern perhaps a different color or pattern begins to materialize just above them feel the emotions run through you and when you are ready release this lantern and any others that follow it into the sky watching a constellation of candle lights appearing in the sky and the rivers reflection you are surrounded by lights [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] look at all the lanterns all around you the lights that flicker in the sky and the water with the golden warmth these are the feelings that you have carried with you the emotions that have taught you much but are no longer useful on your journey they are magnificent but they are temporary and you may let them go take a moment to thank them again for their presence and their guidance and when you are ready sigh out your breath in a long slow wash as you do so the lanterns Bob gently and begin to float upwards lights growing smaller and smaller until they are like tiny pinpricks in the sky one by one they disappear from view carried far out into space to dance with the Stars you are free [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] you [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] and now slowly begin to bring yourself back to your physical body calling your spirit back with compassion you have undergone significant healing in the past few minutes so be gentle with yourself as you continue your daily journeys when you are ready let your eyes drift open and smile you are light you are free and you will discover exactly what you need [Music] you you [Music] you
1 it has been said that one hour of yoga nidra equates to four hours of deep sleep because we go through all of the brainwave stages you typically go through during sleep only in a compressed amount of time using this systematic approach to full body and mind relaxation can help you connect with your own true and natural wisdom your ability for healing and relieving stress if you are feeling stressed this practice can be just what you need to experience inner peace and joy it is also a great way to help you fall asleep and sleep deeply if you practice before bed get ready to heal and restore your body quiet your mind and bring compassion and love into your heart hello and welcome I'm Sara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are on Oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self healing before you begin to settle into your comfortable yoga nidra posture it is important for you to set a specific intention or personal resolve for the practice so you can commit to it at the start let it sink into your subconscious during and revisit it when the practice is coming to a close this intention is called a San culpa this San culpa can help you make a positive change in your life as your brain enters delta-wave frequencies where you are very receptive to change for your San culpa choose something that aligns with your deepest desires this statement is positive in nature and is in the present tense you may choose to start the statement using the words I am as you are solidifying your intention feel it in your heart as if it is true perhaps imagine what your life might be like when it is true you can keep the same San culpa for as long as you like and come back to this practice frequently to send a consistent message to your subconscious feel free to pause this recording to take time to set your intention maybe write it down on a small piece of paper to keep with you after your practice is complete now I would like to take a brief moment to give you some suggestions for your setup as it is important to be extremely comfortable and feel safe in the position you choose for your yoga nidra practice you can choose to lie down on the floor or in your bed for this practice you will want to be fully supported the intent is not to go to sleep it is to relax your body fully so you can relax your mind and let go of stress you may choose to have your head and shoulders slightly elevated to make sure you stay awake you can use a yoga bolster a pillow a rolled blanket or towel under your knees to make sure there is no strain in your lower back you may like a pillow or a blanket under your head as well and I recommend covering up with a blanket as your body temperature will drop as you become more and more relaxed and finally if you like you can cover your eyes with a washcloth or eye pillow now I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes if you like and settle into comfort [Music] let your body sink into the surface below you make any shifts in your body to let yourself settle deeper into the support you can be comforted to know that at this time there is nowhere to go nothing to do everything is okay you have set aside this time to simply feel your body and listen come into stillness now for deep rest and deep nourishment do not worry if you don't hear everything I say it is natural to flow in and out of consciousness the deepest part of you is listening bring your attention to your environment around you listen to the farthest sound outside the room listen to the closest sounds inside the room allow yourself a moment to become aware of anything else you can sense any smells anything you can see inside your closed eyelids or perhaps the temperature of the air around you allow your attention to move inward for a moment and discover a safe place within a place where you feel secure and loved this may be a feeling within your body or a visualization of an actual place where you feel safe know that you may return your attention to this place anytime you need it now in your mind remember your intention or San culpa and stated three times feel it in your heart and body as if it is true now letting your San culpa go for now visualize your own body resting and become aware of your own physical presence [Music] allow the weight of your body and your bones to become heavy [Music] feel your bones sinking into the support allow your awareness to follow the sound of my voice and travel through your body now on a journey of sensation simply feel each part as it is mentioned as you remain still and relax deeper welcome all sensations you experience just as they are begin by noticing where your head meets the support below you allow your head to feel heavy and supported resting fully allow your face to relax letting go of any facial expressions to soften anywhere you can now in your mind you can let your awareness visit the areas in your body as you hear them moving your awareness to your face sensing your mouth feel your mouth feel sensations inside of your mouth notice your jaw lips and where your upper lip touches your lower lip since the inside of your mouth your teeth gums and your tongue feel the inside of your cheeks feel all of your face now as a whole inviting yourself to relax deeper and deeper in your mind find your right hand no need to move simply sense where it is notice your entire right hand your right thumb first finger middle finger ring finger and pinkie finger since your right palm the back of your hand your

bring your awareness now to your breath since your natural breath as it flows through you feel the in-breath and the out-breath notice your breathing as it comes and goes noticing your breath you can relax further if you wish remember this is a time to consciously relax remind yourself to stay awake and alert yet relaxed watch your breath closely without manipulating it simply experience your breath since it feel it follow it attach no judgment to it simply experience your breath fully since the sound of your breath allowing this to be the object of your attention to relax your mind and body further the soft subtle sound is the breath of life when your mind wanders during this practice bring your attention back to the feeling of your breath feel your breath entering into your body through your nostrils follow the path of your breath as it moves into your chest and abdomen and follow the path as your breath moves back out through your nostrils you may feel enlivened by the inhale and relaxed by the exhale feel each breath as energy moving through you inhale with a sense of energetic expansion or inspiration exhale with a sense of letting go of tension letting go of any need to hold on or control because you can let go with every exhale you can make room you can more clearly focus on what's important to you you may notice with the attention on your breath it is slowed down it has relaxed you like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down with every breath you may sense more space between your breaths as well as more space between your thoughts as you inhale and exhale you may imagine a wave passing upward and downward throughout your body carrying away tensions bringing a sense of calm to every cell inside your body now scan through your internal sensations to observe what is there for you right now with acceptance as if you are offering permission to your experience rather than judgment start with your physical experience do you feel a sensation of floating or lightness do you feel other areas of sinking or heaviness can you sense these opposites at the same time light and heavy coexisting scan through your body to notice any areas that feel comfortable and any areas that might feel uncomfortable [Music] noticing back and forth between the two sensations and since areas of comfort and discomfort at the same time coexisting [Music] become aware of your emotions now since the physical feelings of your emotions and where in your body you may experience them scan through your body for the physical sensations that are associated with emotions notice with curiosity and acceptance experience your emotions just as they are looking inward for what you're feeling right now is there contentment or peace or do you sense agitation do you perhaps sense both peace and agitation at the same time what are other qualities you are aware of when you quietly observe look inward not inwards or labels but in sensations and feelings without judgment when you acknowledge and accept these emotions you can allow the energy to move through you these sensations and the awareness of the sensations the listening inward allows you to connect with your body in your heart experience the emotion and the physical sensations rather than think of this emotion and the stories that are associated with it open to all of it awakening to the full experience of life as a balance of sweet and sadness comfort and discomfort blissful moments as well as difficulties when you connect with and sit with this energy it doesn't have to rule you as it moves through you this energy can awaken you to the full experience of life let go of the fear of the emotion and allow it to awaken you let go of the tendency for avoidance of emotion and lean into it as a message from within [Music] as you continue this relaxed inward awareness become aware of any thoughts arising witness them as if you are witnessing a flowing river of thoughts see them surface flow by and disappear each breath cycle naturally Rises and is released similarly our thoughts rise and are then released let this idea this knowledge be a comfort to you to allow your thoughts to drift down the flowing river of thoughts as you observe them you may find it helpful to name these thoughts as they arise identify them as a way to simply be aware of thinking after they have been named witness them as one drop of water in the flowing river of thoughts moving with each of the other thoughts rising and falling and flowing away like your breath rising and falling away your thoughts to rise and fall away no matter how many thoughts come up allow them to flow by if you find yourself following a thought or reacting to a thought bring your attention back to the sensations of your breath if we resist the current of the flowing river of thoughts it will continue to rush against us pushing an opposition perhaps giving you the feeling of being stuck if we accept it allow it we drift effortlessly along with the current the awareness of your thoughts allows you to let go of the hold they may have on you continue noticing your thoughts as they arise and allow them to fall away you may even notice your thoughts coming with more space between them when you practice allowing them to rise and fall as with each cycle of breath if you find you get swept up with a thought with compassion for yourself and patience bring your awareness back to your breath [Music] allow yourself to go further still into relaxation since a safe place inside you a place where you feel secure and loved since the place where your inner joy that you were born with is within you remaining as relaxed and calm as you can invite your imagination to call to mind a person a friend or loved one that makes you smile simply by thinking of them this person is someone that is easy to love your love for this person flows naturally perhaps this individual brings you joy allow the image and the energy of this person to rest within your heart make space for the image or the energy of this person to stay within you perhaps imagine your heart expanding with love that you feel for this person see and feel joy and happiness from this person perhaps do you think of a specific experience or just the nature of this individual feel their joy their happiness if at any point you find your mind wandering let the feeling of joy and happiness bring your attention back and now imagine sharing their joy imagine lifting each other up supporting each other and experiencing joy together since this joy not only in your heart but throughout your entire body connect with this loved ones joy and positive energy as if it is intertwining with your own as you continue to stay with the sensations of joy and happiness in your heart you can repeat the following phrases in your mind or simply send positive energy to that individual that brings you joy may you appreciate the joy in your life may your joy continue and grow may you live with joy and gratitude always [Music] may you appreciate the joy in your life may your joy continue and grow may you live with joy and gratitude always let go of these memories and sense that joy is still within you it is always present and you can call upon it anytime you wish now allow yourself to go deeper still allow all of the thoughts to go let your scanning awareness drift off simply be present with your truest self letting all the layers of yourself dissolve let what seems like boundaries blur since a place inside of you that is the place of your inner wisdom your intuition your truest self here inside you is where your present awareness and insights reside when you pause and simply be your mind stops and you open into expansiveness open into spaciousness [Music] take a moment now to open yourself up and be receptive to whatever you find here open to any messages that arise during this introspective time [Music] [Music] now remember your San culpa bring your intention back to mind repeat your San culpa in your mind several times feel it in your heart planting the seed to grow as you begin to transition out of yoga nidra begin to move your awareness outward again becoming aware of your breath follow your breath awaken gradually with each passing breath become aware of your heart and breathe into this space let the energy of your heart move outward and awaken you as you become more and more aware become aware of the room around you perhaps you notice the sounds around you listening to your environment in your own time begin to move away from your practice moving and stretching your body in any way that feels good to you waking up your body your mind and your heart to go on with your day with your intention and mind when you are ready open your eyes thank you for practicing with me today come back to this practice as often as you need enjoying the benefits equivalent to four hours of deep sleep I hope you have a wonderful day
1 Hello my loves, welcome to a guided sleep meditation by Lavendaire. This meditation will help you relax your body and your mind, preparing you for a peaceful, deep sleep. We will start in a seated posture, and then move onto a lying posture later on. Please find a comfortable seated position on your bed. It might help to add a pillow under you for support. ... Rest your hands on your knees, with your palms facing up. Close your eyes. Take a moment to feel your body, and feel the natural flow of your breath. ... Regardless of what happened in your day, it is time to let it go. Release your day, release all the worries, release all the stress. You don't need it anymore. We'll take 5 deep breaths, with an open mouth exhale. When you inhale, think of peace. When you exhale, let go of any tension that you may be holding onto, both in your body and in your mind. With each exhale, find a deeper & deeper level of release. Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling up the space in the bottom of your belly... Then a deep exhale out through your mouth, releasing all the worries and tension from your day. Take another deep breath in through your nose, breathing in peace, And a big exhale out through your mouth, exhaling all the stress... Deep inhale through your nose, let the air reach deep into your belly... And a deep exhale out through your mouth, letting go... Another deep inhale through your nose, Exhale and let it all out... feel your body soften & relax... Final deep breathe in... inviting peace... And exhale... drop your shoulders and release... Become aware of how your body feels now. And how your breath grows slower and deeper as you relax. .... The mind and body are one. When our mind relaxes, our body relaxes, and vice versa. When we feel stress or anxiety, our bodies hold onto these emotions as physical tension, and it makes it harder for us to relax and sleep well. Every night, make time to clear your mind and relax your body. This is your time to love and nurture your mind, body, and soul. Now, we will do some gentle stretches to further relax the body. Let's start with some neck stretches. Take a deep breath in… And on your exhale, bring your chin down to stretch the back of your neck. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your hands behind your head. Hold here for two full breaths, breathing through the tension with each exhale. On your next exhale bring your chin to neutral and face forward. Onto side neck stretches. Gently tilt your head to the right, and hold for three deep breaths. If you want a deeper stretch, you can gently place your right hand on your head… Reset on your 3rd breath. Now do the opposite side. Tilt your head slowly to the left, and hold for three deep breaths.... Reset on your next exhale… Now let's do a couple neck circles on each side.. While inhaling, slowly roll your head to the right, back, then exhale to the left, and then down… gently at your own pace, do one more round…inhaling for the first half, exhaling for the 2nd half..... Now switch directions. Slowly circle your neck the other way, inhaling to the left, back, exhaling to the right, and down. Repeat for one more round… When you’re done, take a deep breath and open mouth exhale to reset. Next, do 5 shoulder rolls in each direction. Inhale and bring your shoulders forward and up, then roll them back then down. Repeat this circular motion four more times, deep breathing throughout.... Now roll your shoulders 5 times in the the opposite direction, deep breathing throughout and loosening up your shoulder muscles. .... Take a deep breath and reset. Notice how your body feels now. Now that you've begun stretching, listen to your body. Where else would you like to stretch and release tension? Follow your intuition and what your body craves.... Maybe you want to stretch your legs and reach for your toes. Maybe you want to lay down and do some spinal twists. Whatever it may be, listen to your body and follow what your body is telling you..... Remember to deep breathe through each stretch. .... [ 2.5 min ] Whenever you're ready, move into a lying position. We'll start with a slow breathing exercise with 3 slow breaths. Take a deep breath into your abdomen... hold it there for 3 seconds, and exhale slowly, elongating your exhale as much as you can.... Take another deep breathe in through your nose, breathing into your abdomen.... hold it there for 3 seconds... and exhale slowly. One more breath like that, inhale into your abdomen, hold it for 3 seconds.. and then slowly exhale until you have no more air left. Take a healing breath in, and exhale it out... Feel your breath and heart rate slow down. It is time to completely let go, and allow yourself to just be. We will now relax the entire body, bringing awareness to one area at a time. With each area, feel your body melt into the bed—into total relaxation. Relax your forehead… Relax your eyebrows... Relax your lips… Relax all your facial muscles... Relax your scalp… Relax your brain… Relax your shoulders… Relax your arms... relax your hands… relax your fingertips. Relax your heart…. Relax your stomach. Relax your hips.. Relax your thighs... Relax your calves…. Relax your feet.... Relax your toes. Feel your entire body totally relax... Take a slow deep breath in... and a slow deep breath out.... allowing your body to sink into your bed, comfortably, peacefully. You are safe. You are safe now. .... Allow your mind to drift... into the space between the conscious and subconscious. You are safe. You are safe now. In this space of zero effort, there is nothing more for you to do, but to let go and allow yourself to rest. Rest. Beautiful, nourishing, loving - rest. You deserve it. Sending you so much love and light. Sweet dreams. & Namaste.

other realities breathe from galaxy to galaxy you explore seeing things you've never even imagined it before you choose the experience you wish to have and so you choose to stand amongst the stars they move and swirl in cyclones and waves they shine with an incomparable brightness and yet the brightness does not hurt your eyes it's as if you were looking at a soft glow instead you encircle them in or of what is happening you stick out your hands and the stars fall through the center of your palms and zip through the sky notice that the sound they make as they dash through the sky as you look

you can see other beautiful beings dancing upon the Stars as they continue their descent as you fly downward you begin to feel a familiar sensation of home closer and closer the sensation grows and suddenly the stars disappear and your feet may planted on a field of tall green grass [Music] there is immediate stillness the contrast between the stillness of standing versus the inertia of flying

your life may need a little energy healing and you will give your spirit exactly what it needs compassion gentleness and the ability to transform into something more beautiful than you can ever imagine so for right now relax a little deeper feel every part of your body from your feet right up to your face from your scalp right down to your toes as you notice tension allow it to dissolve away sinking into a state of blissful calm feel your breath and relax [Music] [Music] as you grow more relaxed your attention drifts to a red light at the base of your tailbone this is the root chakra your connection with the earth and your physical body it grounds you and harnesses your energy at a very intuitive level this chakra is your sense of survival it has your will to live as such fear or trauma in this area can manifest itself through physical or mental imbalance fear or distrust of others at its best the chakra allows you to reconnect with wisdom and stories of your ancestors resting secure in your own place in the human family if you have struggled with any of these areas or simply wish to boost your courage and resourcefulness imagine this ruby red light growing stronger and more resolute with each inhale feel your strength and rootedness growing with every breath even as your body sinks into a deeper sense of calm [Music] your breath and awareness continues up your spine to rest just above your pelvis this is your sacral chakra represented by an orange light take a moment to sense the energy of this chakra is the orange light brilliantly colored or does it emit just a dull glow whatever you sense allow your breath to flow freely and without judgement as you listen to the wisdom of this chakra the second chakra is your Center for emotions pleasure nurturing and creation whatever that may mean to you our desire for warmth and nourishment resides here asked us the drive to create things that share our gifts and talents with the world a lack or surplus of any of these things can result in an imbalance or sense of disease in these areas so as you listen to the wisdom of your body feel your breath of stoking the fire of your second chakra restoring your energy and vitality breathing in and out [Music] [Music] as you grow more relaxed feel your mind shifting gently to your third chakra the energy center that pulses with yellow light just below your solar plexus the chakra is the home of your willpower and sense of belonging as you notice the way it looks and feels ask yourself if you have felt any discomfort in this area either physically or mentally are there places in your life that you feel you aren't meant to be do you have habits or routines you wish you could put an end to or develop further maybe with every breath you take this golden light grows brighter and brighter as the light brightens you can feel your sense of self and your personal drive returning to balance either increasing in strength or mellowing in intensity as you breathe and grow even more tranquil [Music] [Music] your body sinks deeper into the bed engulfed in a sea of relaxation your consciousness calm and at ease turned its attention to the fourth chakra lit by an emerald light resting at your heart this chakra like the ancient heart symbol represents love and compassion for yourself and others in its purest state this love is unconditional unreserved and filled with joy love is a part of everything from the way you order a meal at a restaurant to the way you talk to your body for many of us love is a subject tightened with anger pain and distrust [Music] as you breathe allow your mind to disconnect from past relationships experiences and beliefs that may limit your ability to love others without reason or expectation and as you do so feel your heart grow warmer and this emerald light become brighter and cleaner [Music] [Music] [Music] feel a breath rise a little higher stopping at your throat noticing the bright blue light that emanates from this part of your spiritual consciousness the chakra addresses speaking out truths sharing our creativity and ideas and moderating the balance of sharing and listening as you breathe a little deeper feeling muscle tension dissolving away ask yourself if this blue light is as vibrant as you would like is this something that you need to say that you haven't yet have you said something you regret do you balance your speaking with listening your creativity with rest if not smile gently at yourself and forgive even as you allow your focus to strengthen this area to better represent your spiritual intelligence and magnificent wisdom and as this light grows brighter cleaner more pure feel your body sink a little deeper into your bed the blankets around you soothing your body as your spirit grows stronger and brighter than ever before [Music] [Music] above this bright blue light is the darker regal glow of your sixth chakra the third eye chakra it is located just between your eyebrows and governs your ability to see and understand seeing in this context does not just imply the physical act of viewing what is around you instead it allows you to perceive the meaning of what you witness allow yourself to reflect on whether you have been missing the obvious or seeing things where there are none if you find yourself skewed one way or another simply allow your breath to realign your body and spirit as you feel your intuitive self grow in confidence and clarity breathe and feel this chakra between your eyes notice the sensations that come with it so you understand when the third eye begins to communicate through your physical presence [Music] [Music] [Music] and now your awareness reaches your seventh chakra the crown chakra which inhabits no physical space in your body but instead hovers above your scalp like a halo some people perceive this chakra as a royal purple while others see it as brilliant white the combination of all other colors of light whatever you may see here allow your consciousness to ponder the phrase I know for it is this Madra that guides this chakra boredom depression and confusion can result in an imbalance in this area for it is the crown chakra that helps us focus not on ourselves as individuals but on ourselves as a part of a greater whole so breathe in welcoming the unity that comes from the being part of something greater and feel your physical being revel in the unity of mind body and spirit breathe in and let go [Music] [Music] [Music] and now give yourself a moment to understand the way alignment feels in your body [Music] since the rainbow of light that begins at your tailbone and runs all the way up your spine illuminating your body and the room around you with a vibrant light feel the strength and confidence that comes from being totally aligned body mind and spirit working together in perfect concert feel it and breathe give yourself the permission you need to relax for a few moments utterly and completely giving yourself to this sense of deep relaxation and a wholeness at this moment in time you are in tune with the tremendous power yourself as the spoken part of this meditation draws to a close focus your attention on the way your body feels enjoy the sensations of harmony and peace as you feel your mind drifting into unconsciousness as your body follows suit breathe and know that you are complete namaste [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to this guided meditation my name is Jason and over the course of the next half hour or so we will journey into relaxation leaving your thoughts and worries behind as you saw through the sky this is a meditation about flying if you are uncomfortable with heights or nervous about the idea of floating on the air don't worry as long as you listen to the sounds of this meditation no harm can befall you you are entirely magnificently safe free to drift with ease of any a great burden with this in mind make sure you've found a comfortable position and when you are ready settle in and let your eyes drift closed take a moment to get back in touch with your breath how does it feel to inhabit your body right now are there any areas that seem more tense than usual can you let go of that pain just for a little bit and now turn your attention to your mind to the constant dialog that accompanies you through your waking life are there any sticking points in your thoughts or does your stream-of-consciousness flow through your mind easily nothing left behind if there is an issue a memory or a person who keeps cropping up ask yourself if you can let go of it just for a little bit even the most pleasant of thoughts and memories can cloud your meditation experience keep you from focusing and enjoying the present moment when you are ready turn your attention away from your body and your thoughts and toward your breath let the oxygen flow a little bit slower a little bit deeper [Music] and as you breathe allow your conscious mind to shut down and your imagination to awaken your body sinks deeper into the chair or mattress as your imagination wakes up bringing you visions of bright blue skies the sensation of flight [Music] imagine yourself standing up from your chair or bed wherever you might be right now imagine yourself walking out of this room all the way to the front door of your home or office [Music] as you stand outside on the sidewalk you take a giant leap into the air as you do so you find the air support you hold you suspended on your next inhale the wind catches you lifting you gently upward or quickly or as slowly as you would like you are flying in control of the direction and the speed of your path take a moment to experiment with your newfound ability dipping and twirling through the air as the wind tickles your cheese [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] far below you the ground looks like thousands of tiny rugs all laid together pinpricks of light spill across the landscape like glitter punctuated every so often by the fluffy green of a stand of trees lakes and rivers squiggle through the dusty plains and grassy Dells houses are sorted neatly into little rectangular yards divided up by narrow ribbons of gray pavements highway and interstate roadways meander around sharp mountain peaks the vehicles traveling along them with tiny flakes of color even the most chaotic sides where the construction projects or road work are neatly organized from above everything has a pattern articulated through swoops and grids and arcs visible only from the air if you would like now you can take some moments to examine them more closely or you can simply let go and enjoy the experience of flight [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the air supports you boys you up carries you along on it's warm currents you can feel the resistance against your arms a sensory knowledge that tells you exactly how sharply you can turn how deeply you can dive how quickly you can stop midair your body understands how to dip and twirl how to saw or slow down without your mind and necessarily knowing what must happen you are fearless carried by the knowledge that your muscles know exactly what to do with this in mind allow yourself to soar to dive to Bank against the wind allowing the sensations of flying to leave daily worries and stress far behind you you are as magnificent as an eagle as strong as wise as utterly in control as a majestic bird of prey enjoy it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as you saw along you encounter a flock of birds perhaps geese or songbirds on their migration somewhere following invisible ancestral flight plans through the clouds if you would like you can fly with them for a bit body instantly attuned to the way the air washes across their wings over their backs bearing them effortlessly along the wind you can speak with them enjoy their chatter or savor the silence and whenever you want you can bank with the wind off in another direction swooping low over mountain canyons and desert flowers feel the air temperature change your speed increase and decrease all with the easy confidence that your abilities bring [Music] there are some rain clouds off to one side if you would like you can fly through them feeling the cool rain on your back and face as you dance with the raindrops as you spin through the air gracefully entirely in control oh you could fly to where the Sun is just rising feeling the warmth of the morning creep over the horizon watching it gild the clouds with a heavenly light anything is within your reach here high above the earth here amongst the clouds you are completely safe and entirely in control your every moment as graceful as a ballet dancers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and now allow yourself to hear the call of your physical body the beckoning of the place where you began this meditation there is no rush to return instead let yourself frolic amongst the clouds dip between the travelling currents of air savor the grace and power within your body enjoy the tranquility within your mind watch the world below noting its geometrical rhythms the colors melting into one another [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] give yourself a few moments to find your home or office amongst the neatly organized buildings below you and when you are ready begin your gradual descent allow yourself to circle savoring the rush of air against your arms that particular pressure that assures you that you know exactly how to fly you move more slowly more confidently the lower you get at first the sites below you grow gradually larger sinks slowly down to the ground outside your home or office [Music] with a deep breath you open the front door move inside head back to whatever room you began this meditation in when you arrive you see your physical body calm relaxed resting take a moment remember the sensations of flying and when you are ready reach out your hand to touch your physical presence and feel yourself re inhabit your body when you are ready allow your eyes to open this meditation is drawing to a close and you are back amongst us just as majestic and graceful as when you were soaring amongst the clouds [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you

1 Music] hi there and welcome to our guided session my name is Marty and I'm gonna be taking you through a calming breathing exercise called equal breathing we refer to this exercise as equal breathing because our inhales holds and exhales will all be equal amounts of time each breathing cycle will incrementally increase in length as we progress both inhales and exhales will be through your nose for every breath start breathing through your nose now this breathing method is effective in calming the nervous system relaxing your mind and reducing stress it is especially effective when trying to relax and fall asleep in fact why don't you start getting comfortable right now pull back the sheets and blankets lay your head down on your comfortable pillow settle in a body at rest is the first step to a mind at rest lying down is an important surrender a surrender - gravity it's you giving up that constant exertion and muscle tension that accumulates over the day just from standing and walking bring your focus to the soles of your feet and see how much tension there is to let go of there feel the light tingle in your arches and toes that's the relief of not having to hold the body to wait any longer as you continue to scan your body moving up from the feet let the rest of your muscles follow suit relaxing one by one it's time to give up and let gravity cradle you into your bed you have to give up control in order to fall asleep give up any restless streams of thought give up thinking about the day you just had for the day you're about to start just be here in between and know that this is your time for release and restoration keep in mind breathing exercises can be challenging for some people I'm here to be your guide there is no success or failure in this exercise just go at your own pace and stop to rest as needed keep breathing in through the nose out through the nose [Music] let's begin [Music] start by just taking a few deep breaths like stretching we want to warm up a bit and open your lungs so in through your nose out through your nose following me in through your nose out through your nose once more in through your nose out through your nose good now let's begin equal breathing in a moment I'm going to instruct you to inhale hold then exhale through your nose for four seconds each we will then increase all three phases inhales holds and exhales by one second each round until we get to eight seconds so after our four second round we will slow and deepen our breath for a five second round then a six second round followed by a seven second round ending on an eight second round of inhale hold exhale that's equal breathing now that we're calm and comfortable let's begin following my count inhale two three four hold two three four exhale two three four we're gonna do that a few times inhale two three four hold two three four exhale two three four again inhale two three four hold two three four and exhale two three four inhale through your nose three four and hold two three four exhale through your nose three four in two three four hold two three four exhale two three four remember every breath we are taking is in through your nose and back out through your nose if you feel yourself struggling to keep up just relax and go at your own pace focus only on your breathing and my voice let everything else slip away just you and your breath this next round breaths will be slightly slower and deeper five seconds for each inhale hold and exhale with me inhale two three four five hold two three four five exhale two three four five in two three four five and hold two three four five exhale two three four five in two three four five hold two three four five out two three four five in two three four five hold two three

forehead and face muscles any tension in your jaw or cheeks or forehead let it melt away this next round we're gonna lengthen and deepen our breath to a count of six four inhales holds and exhales with me again inhale through your nose one two three four five six and hold two three four five six and out two three four five six and in two three four five six hold two three four five six out two

one two three four five six and hold two three four five six breathe out two three four five six good this breathing technique helps you to release stress and get grounded the rhythm and intention of equal breathing helps you fall and stay asleep this next round we're going to go a little bit longer and a little bit deeper with inhale hold and exhale for a count of seven [Music] with me big inhale through your nose two three four five six seven and hold two three four five six seven and out two three four five six seven again two three four five six seven hold two three four five six seven and

it's the most calming sound and sensation in your world steady breath this exercise is just designed to help you fall asleep so if you start to drift allow yourself to go deeper just stay with the sound of my voice no need to listen to the specifics [Music] before we start our last round at a count of eight I want you to check in with your body again scan up from the soles of your feet to your calves go even a little bit higher with your consciousness and feel the warm tingle in your thighs scan up even a little further into your belly feel the sensation there the tingle that comes when you let go of tension from each body part that's all I want you to focus on your arms are lying next to you loosely and the palms of your hands are open and free letting go of everything complete relaxation weightless if you're on the edge of sleep just let yourself fall this last round is going to be an eight-count the longest and deepest breaths of the exercise with me inhale two three four

five six seven eight relax and let your breath find its natural rhythm no more counting give up control [Music] you no longer need to guide your breath instead trust that your breath will guide you your body is imprinted into your bed and your head warm imprinted into your pillow you feel weightless like a leaf floating down a stream let it take you where it will trust that the stream is safe it's only there to guide you to restore you and take you into sleep give up control and let it pull you where it will each inhale you breathe heals you restores you nourishes you that rich oxygen is Earth's gift breathe it in like life that's what it is each exhale is a release clearing your mind of stress and your body of tension like exhaust your chest and diaphragm sink and surrender to gravity every time your breath continues on like a stream pushing and pulling itself effortlessly let the stream take you take you down into rest and then deeper into sleep let it take you deeper deeper deeper into sleep [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
1 [Music] [Music] the chakras and your higher self guided meditation hello and welcome to this guided meditation my name is Jason Stevenson and thank you for taking the time to join me and trusting in my work this meditation will consist of a body relaxation to begin with followed by the spoken chakra and communing with your higher self too often we get so caught up in our lives that we forget to really live and really living means existing beyond the confines and demands of schedules immediate wants and needs the expectations of others and the need to conform I wonder if you can remember what it was like as a child what it was like to just be to live and to be joyful without a question to live free of doubt and self-criticism it's all about being in the moment enjoying it free of expectations and just being alive William Blake put it best when he wrote to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour it's and so beautiful but I guess we think but how can you hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour is it even possible yes it is true.you exists in all things and all things exist within you when you truly understand that you experience the entire universe within yourself and yourself as the entire universe once you experience that then you grasp that heaven already dwells within you as does infinity within that heaven lies all possibility and all joy and with that infinite space lies infinite wisdom and infinite power all begins with breath the bridge between your smaller self and your higher self let's begin just finding a comfortable place either seated or lying down making sure there are no distractions for the next 30 minutes or so and just breathing in and out now through your nose and seeing if you can slow your breath down to a count of three so breathing in on a count of three through your nose and releasing that breath on a count of three so it's inhaling one two three exhale one two three and just see if you can keep a steady rhythm similar to this but that's comfortable for you the remainder of this meditation we'll begin with a body scan now just becoming aware of your body and starting at the top of your head noticing any sensations here the density and the space this area takes up and including in that awareness as your phorid I'm aware of this area [Music] without judgment just being aware and feeling any sensations that may arise [Music] and taking in and awareness of your eyes your ears your nose and cheeks [Music] your mouth and lips or teeth the entire face sensing any sensations even sensing where the air meets your skin and becoming aware moment by moment if any sensations or feelings that you feel come and go and during this time if your mind wanders that's simply okay just allow it to be your only role is to simply acknowledge your thought if it wanders and then come back to focusing on the parts of your body my voice and sensations that you feel [Music] so we're going to shift that focus now from the top of your head and your face moving it down to the neck your shoulders you might even feel your shoulders relaxed a little this is a place where we store a lot of tension our shoulders and our shoulder blades also being aware of your neck and your throat area [Music] you're sensing what is going on here [Music] you might even be able to feel air coming and going in the throat area moving down now to focus on your arms elbows [Music] and your forearms [Music] and down to your wrists and your hands [Music] your hands may be either resting on your lap or at your side right down to your fingertips [Music] see if you can sense the weight of your hands and each individual finger [Music] and any sensations that you may feel just being aware moment by moment [Music] and shifting your awareness now up to your chest area you may sense the rise and fall of your chest the subtle rise and fall [Music] and bringing your awareness to your ribcage the front the sides of your ribcage and ride around your upper back its resting either against the chair or on the mattress of your bed if you sense any tension or aches or pains just bring a gentle awareness to this not forcing any pain or aches away but rather just simply being aware [Music] moving that awareness down now to the abdomen area your stomach feeling sensations here you may feel it softening releasing and just the chest you may feel your belly rising and falling as the air comes and goes whatever you feel whatever you sense just be open and aware and accept [Music] and shifting that awareness now to the lower back area [Music] you may send some pressure here [Music] and continue to shift your focus to the pelvis area your buttocks being aware the space that this takes up the air against your skin any sensations that you may feel allow them to come and go with full acceptance [Music] continue now to bring your awareness to your thighs the top of your thighs besides inner thighs and underneath you may feel the pressure of where you're laying or seated sensing the weight of your legs if your mind begins to wander at all that's okay just simply bring it back now to focusing on your thighs and moving now down to focusing on your knees the top bony part of your knee and the inner fleshy part underneath in full awareness just accepting anything that comes and goes any sensations feelings thoughts with full acceptance [Music] you may become aware of some discomfort or pain that is okay to just be with this [Music] moving your attention now to your calf muscles of both legs if you were lying down in bed you may feel the calf muscles spread against your bed [Music] and shifting around your shins and finally bringing your attention to both of your feet the soles of your feet any pressure that's attending here the breach of both feet ankles and right down to your toes each single toe you may even sense the space between each toe [Music] [Music] just checking in on your breathing now and feeling this breath sustaining you breathing in and out throughout your entire body [Music] and seeing if you can take in now the awareness of your entire body from your feet all the way up to the top of your head [Music] accepting all that is without judgment just being aware [Music] just stay with this for a few moments and allow yourself to relax further [Music] I'd like you to bring your focus now to the base of your spine [Music] and Eli's your first chakra the part of you that says I am see if you can bring your breath here and give thanks for your sense of being inhale into this chakra and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I am just stay with this for a few more breaths [Music] [Music] I'd like you to now bring your attention to the spot just below your belly button this is your second chakra the part of yourself that says by desire and see if you can breathe into this point and give thanks for your existence as you exhale mentally say to yourself by desire and just stay with this for a few breaths [Music] now if you'd bring your attention to your belly button this is your third chakra area which gives you the urge to act just bring your in-breath here and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I act and keep this breath going here for a few moments focusing now on your solar plexus and this is located just beneath the midpoint of your chest and this is your fourth chakra the part of you that feels take your in-breath here and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I feel and again just staying here for a few breaths now bring your attention to the base of your throat and here lies your fifth chakra the part of you that expresses bring your in-breath here and as you exhale mentally say to yourself and make myself known and please keep this up for the span of a few breaths now bringing your focus to the space between your brows this is where your sixth chakra is the part of you the comprehends breathe into this spot and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I understand and stay here for a few moments [Music] now with your eyes still closed see if you can raise your eyes and try to look at the roof of your head don't strain yourself just if you feel discomfort or pain just lower your gaze until you find a position you're comfortable with here at the top of your head lie as your seventh chakra the part of you that understands things free of prejudice discrimination feeling and attachment so bring your in-breath E and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I know and we'll stay here for a few moments shifting your awareness now to pay attention to your entire length of your spine visualize it as a white pillar of light whose bottom starts at the base of your spine rising up through your body up past your neck rises through the middle of your head and right to the top of your head if it helps you can imagine that your entire body is a pole made of pure white light one end of that light rises up through the middle topmost part of your head stretching many miles above you with your eyes raised as high as you can comfortably lift try to see where that light goes as it rises up past the roof of your head although that beam of light goes off into eternity there is a sort of barrier that lies some 12 inches above your head this is the eighth chakra also called the great sound from your perspective it might look like an umbrella or as if you were sitting beneath a great transparent jellyfish loading some 12 inches above your head it's also called the witness the part of you that's attached to your body but isn't in your body [Music] this witness is the midway point between your physical self and your higher self which has never been born and can never die you might like to think of it as a boy bobbing on the water's surface beneath that boy is a string attached to the oceans floor the beam of light that starts at the base of your spine and shoots out through the top of your head between the boy on the water's surface and the anchor that keeps it bound to the oceans for liars and not and that knot is the witness connecting your physical body your highest self which never lives and never dies [Music] rising up that beam of light that point some 12 inches above your head is a light body it's a detached version of you one that knows your likes and dislikes your passions and urges it doesn't judge you simply observes and record your thoughts and your feelings without thinking or feeling them [Music] as the witness you sent your body below feel it breathing gently beneath you [Music] as you witness you feel and see the line of light stretching forth above you toward infinity there is an ebb and flow of impressions and sensations that your lower self transmits to you in flashes remember there you sit a float in a timeless sense of being you are light made of light and encased in light emitting light from that perspective you see but do not judge the actions of your lower self you see it scrambled back and forth like a toddler just learning to walk like a child it makes mistakes as it was born to do but how else can it learn [Music] this is part and parcel of who and what it is that one that sits a liar's in meditation is calling out to you but may feel lost alone adrift or in need of guidance may feel disconnected confused and grounded it reaches for you as a toddler reaches out to its mother just listening now it asks for guidance reach out simply reach out and reminder that it is loved it has always been loved and will always be loved [Music] with each in-breath that draws the memory of you deeper into itself with each out breath it stretches forth and reaches out to you here in this moment [Music] let the barriers of memory weaken so that the body sitting below you can feel you again feel its gentle rhythmic in-breath and out-breath expand and contract its wondrous body drawing you in with each inhalation and reaching out to you with each exhalation guide it that it may live in wisdom and power so that it may make the right choices at the right time in the right place and with the right people guide it but it may live in dignity and grace making the right choices at the right time at the right place with the right people guide it that it may live in peace and joy [Music] guided that it may speak to you and hear you whenever the need arises always at the right time at the right place and with the right people [Music] through your guidance may had finally learn to see the world in a grain of sand and heaven in everyone and everything even itself [Music] through your guidance made finally learn the power of seeing infinity in its own existence and eternity in the joy of every breath and every passing moment [Music] [Music] bring your focus back to the top of your head be all that light of your own power above you and know that it will always be there whenever you need its guidance simply be still and breathe slowly rhythmically [Music] inhale now and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I know [Music] and again inhale and on the exhale say I know [Music] and stay with this for a few moments return your focus to the spot between your eyebrows gently lower your eyes so they gaze at the back of your foreign [Music] inhale and as you exhale mentally say to yourself I understand inhale exhale I understand [Music] still focused on your breathing keeping your eyes closed and slowly return your breathing to normal bringing your breath back to an easy comfortable rhythm at this point you may return to waking life who you may continue to drift off into a deeper purposeful sleep welcome home my friend

1 [Music] hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this sleep meditation hypnosis over the course of the next few minutes we will journey through four different environments exploring peace and relaxation in the context of each one of them at the end you will have the freedom to select the right one for you attuning your spiritual surroundings to what you need for health healing and your happiness with this in mind allow a calm sense of expectation to rise in your mind and set an intention to rest deeply and completely feel your body relaxed more than it has in a long while all the tension in your body dissolving bit by bit let every muscle in your body relax even those in the place you normally hold tired this may be your forehead your lips or jaw the back of your head your shoulder blades your lower back your belly your knees or ankles and right down to the tendons in your feet feel your whole body melt into wherever you rest and allow the surface around you to support your body let's begin our meditation so lying down keeping your back straight as much as you can feel your body becoming more serene you are still and peaceful in this breath and the next as you relax you begin to hear the crash of water in the distance as you sink a little deeper into relaxation it grows louder until you yourself are standing on the banks of an enormous waterfall it is morning and the sunlight catches the water as it falls creating thousands of tiny rainbows in the spray around the cliff the rumble of moving water is at once both soothing and awe-inspiring a symphony of Earth's very essence tumbling around you take a moment to breathe in this majesty [Music] [Music] as you look more closely at the waterfall bill the cool mist envelop your face leaving dewy droplets on your cheeks and Florida feel the vitality and power of this place all around you in the warmth of the cliff bases the gentle glow of the Sun the frothy water around the Falls notice yourself becoming karma beginning to let go of your worries and physical tension allow yourself to breathe letting the rush of the water guide you into a deeper relaxation allow yourself to feel the slow transitions from inhale to exhale and from exhale to inhale note the tiny delicate paws in the center of these transitions that space where inhalation ends but before exhalation begins breathe as deeply or as shallowly as comfortable for you your chest moving rhythmically and effortlessly as you sink a little deeper into relaxation letting go of any worry or stress if at any time your mind wanders simply bring it gently back to your breath a calming gentle process of bringing air into your lungs feel any tension in your body lift away with every breath you take nothing can hurt you here enjoy these next few moments next to the waterfall letting your worries dissolve under the relentless rumble of fresh rainwater [Music] [Music] as you notice the sounds of the meditation begin to change allow your imagination to follow your feelings to follow creating around you a magnificent sandy beach waves break in crystalline sprays and the call of seagulls eases your mind smell the sharp tang of salt and the warm dustiness of hot sand let your shoulders droop and your fora done crease in the background you can hear the wash of the ocean waves breaking on the beach you can watch the water if you like or close your imaginary eyes and simply dwell in the presence of your other senses breathe and listen let everything else go so much of meditation is the practice of letting go of accepting that you cannot control everything around you of welcoming in the infinite glorious possibilities and opportunities that are waiting for you letting go of your conscious discipline your task oriented nature is the gateway to relaxation so taking a breath in and exhale letting go of the need to control your experience just for a few minutes allow yourself to feel whatever arises letting go of everything negative and treasuring the beauty of this moment's experience as your body lets go of any tension your breath slows down and it may deepen just a slight bit simply follow its rhythm listening to the quiet in and out of air in your lungs if you would like match your breath to the tempo of the sea nearby following the rise and fall of the waves behind whatever feels most comfortable most relaxing and embrace it this is your chance to discover and choose whatever you need to rest most fully and again as the music and sounds of this meditation begin to change allow yourself to be transported to the banks of a freshwater brook or river where fish jump and the sunlight glints on the wet rocks as you take a deep inhale you breathe in the burbling sound of water on stones and the gentle sigh of wind in the young tree boughs take another deep breath and then release it relishing the warmth of the air that leaves your body feel your feet sink into the soft grass of the riverbank and notice the bright green color of early spring if you would like you may dip your foot into the stream noticing the way the water washes over your toes cooling your skin you can hear a few honeybees buzzing about enjoying the landscape as much as you are you know that the bees will not harm you and so you can continue to enjoy the gentle harmony they make a soft sound that sets off the silver tinkling music of the creek a little way in front of you a butterfly flutters on the breeze dipping and soaring with the invisible current of the wind you hold out your hand and it floats closer to you landing on your skin with an almost imperceptible touch allow yourself to lay down on the riverbanks feeling the way the grass molds around your body supporting your back and neck so you can relax more completely above you you can see a fluffy white cloud a clear blue sky all around you are the sounds of nature peaceful and rhythmic your thoughts disappeared replaced by this music of nature you can feel all the aches and pains in your body dissolve away as you sink a little deeper into the warm grass relaxed and at peace in this beautiful landscape give yourself permission to enjoy it as you breathe you feel yourself growing lighter more relaxed almost as if the stresses and tensions of the day are being washed away in the cheerful sound of the river breathe in welcoming inspiration and peace breathe out exhaling worry and fear this is your time embrace it now in these next few moments and now as the music and sounds around you change one small breathe in and find yourself on the path of a majestic and ancient forest the trail through the forest is verdant lined with the carpet of the grass your feet sink into it's slightly brushing against the soft coolness of its surface birds sing in the trees a symphony of natural beauty some chirp back and forth others trill melodies into the wind a gentle breeze sways in the trees and the soft touch of its passing soothes your skin the sunshine is less bright here dappled and soft instead of its usual brash gold the air feels a little cooler a little moister than what you are accustomed to and yet it is a soothing coolness filled with the scent of dry leaves wet bark and soft green moss [Music] [Music] as you walk further and deeper into the forest the trees become larger their trunks wider and spaced further apart in the resulting space hangs a mantle of pearly fog floating a few feet above the ground as you walk your legs stir the fog and it swirls around you gauzy tendrils lazy soft against your skin birdsong accompanies you along your journey lifting your spirit and soothing your body with its innocent sounds let your self marvel at the size of these trees as wide around as dining tables and almost taller than your eyes can see smell the dampness of believes and dirt underneath them nourishing and protecting their roots imagine how far these tree's roots must extend into the earth in order to remain sturdy and upright above all allow the nature's music to guide you into further relaxation as you breathe deeply watching the sunlight meander back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze bring your attention to yourself are you holding any tension or is there any pain in your body are you carrying or holding on to something in your back your neck or your shoulders is there tension in your hips or perhaps the way you squeeze your eyelid shut how does it feel to be you right now you are still and tranquil United with this peaceful an ageless environment feel your body relaxing as you breathe a little deeper letting go of anything that might distract you let yourself focus completely on the beauty of the forest sense it feel what it's like welcoming the harmony and stillness that accompanies it [Music] allow your attention to travel across your body noticing how deeply your muscles and tendons have relaxed since now the space between your thoughts the ease with which your mind moves between thoughts never lingering too long on one subject you feel calm peaceful and daddy's now in this state of quiet peace as this meditation spoken part comes to an end allow your mind to return to that place savoring the beautiful details as you sink further into this state of happy equanimity let your breath guide you and enjoy the final moments of music as you drift off into a deep and peaceful sleep rest well my friend rest well you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music]

tangle you do not need to look or sound a certain way to find deep peace and contentment follow your heart and intuition slow and effortless is a time now for letting go this may be a guided

rest to tend to your own well-being and sometimes the person who needs this reminder most is you and so breathe a little deeper because you can allow your limbs to relax a little further because it's possible and give yourself permission luxurious decadent permission to fall deeply and powerfully asleep it is not a command only permission your body may do whatever it pleases sinking even deeper

1 [Music] greetings my friends my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this sleep meditation guardians of the rainforest where you will journey deep into the lush rainforests and your questions will be answered allowing you to drift into a deep and restful sleep [Music] just making sure that you are comfortable now completely comfortable lying on your back with your arms by your side wriggling around until you get comfortable gently closing your eyes and using this initial time to take in a number of deep breaths sending that breath all the way down to your belly area breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth as you're breathing in be comfortable where you are and knowing that you're in the right place at the right time for this moment [Music] [Music] and returning your breath to a natural comfortable rhythm in and out through your nose as you do this becoming aware of the sensations of the breath as it goes into your belly we feel it expand doesn't leaves your belly you feel your belly just go down slightly this is not a forced breath or forced movement rather it's just a reaction a natural reaction to the breath going in and out moment by moment breath by breath [Music] [Music] [Music] I'd like you to become aware now of your entire body where your body meets the bed where your heels are resting your arms and your hands lying by your side and feeling the weight of your body feeling the sensations of the sheets or blankets against your body or the pillow supporting your head [Music] and what I'd like you to do in these next few moments is to allow a body scan from the top of your head right down slowly to the tips of your toes and as you scan your body you're going to go along and witness any sensations that might be happening within various parts of your body now this may be physical sensations or it may be even stored emotions it's not about changing anything it's just about being present with your body your physical sensations and your emotions so scanning now from the top of your head right down to the tip of your toes and take a few minutes to do this and I will return [Music] [Music] [Music] I'd like you to visualize yourself now entering a lush green rain forest a place that seems almost magical hundreds of thousands of years old trees and foliage and a river that meanders to the right side of you you begin to go down to this river and walk alongside it as you do paying attention to the sounds of this river the healing sensations that it delivers to you you are at peace here there's no one else to disturb you only you and nature each time a thought comes up for you allow that thought to float by and you might like to project that thought into the river and allow that thought to trickle downstream actually see that the thought beginning to be placed into the river and beginning to leave you watch it as it goes the tune comes to your mind row row row your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream the river and all the stones within the river are here today to have lessons to teach you gentle lessons reminders because you already know inherently what it is here to teach you as you continue to walk up a slanted hill the gentle rivers still rolling along beside you you hear it whisper to you you already have everything you need it says you already have everything you need this reminder circulates throughout you at times you might be striving wanting reaching desiring something else to come in your life the river is here to tell you that you are already connected to everything that is and whatever you need whatever you desire is really only a thought away from your reality it all begins with a thought you are the co-creator of your life it's almost like you can let go of the striving this is not by any means being lazy rather it's simply surrendering to the process and trusting that your gentle actions are already in place manifesting your desires take a moment now to visualize the river and put your hands in allow the waters to splash to your face be grateful for this river and for all you have within your life at this time you might want to say a silent thank you as you continue on to move upwards the Sun peers through the top of the canopy of the rain forest creating almost a halo effect around you warming you soothing you you can almost feel the vibration of the cells within your body as they come alive from this beautiful sunlight you stand still in this place and allow the sun's rays to sink into your mind your body and spirit and so you continue the gentle sounds of the river following you as you continue on your path you take some time now to sit at the riverbank and allow your feet to soak within the cool water enjoy the coolness of the water as it flows between your toes around your feet and feeling the gravelly earth within the riverbed itself soothing your feet you might even want to rub them with in this gravelly earth almost like a massage for your feet as you look upstream you begin to see a bottle floating down with a note inside it as it comes closer to you you catch the bottle and you pour the cork out and read the note as you open up the note take a look at what it says you read the note the words materialize almost out of thin air they say you are loved for the uniqueness of who you are go out there and shine and let it be known to the world here is another reminder to you that something you inherently already know and yet sometimes you dismiss this you don't feel worthy you don't feel that you were good enough well this note is here to tell you that right now you are loved you are worthy and you are perfect in this very moment and it's calling out for you to truly recognize this and to acknowledge this to feel this with all your entire being and once you acknowledge this you give a mission for others to light up their lives too for others to recognize the love within themselves just take a few moments to sit with this to sit with this love within you you might begin to feel it radiating from the inside out allowing your body to grow lighter and shine brighter with every breath in and out you take this note and you place it back into the bottle and put the cork back on throwing it back into the river and allowing someone else downstream to receive the same message you begin to get up and continue on your journey [Music] as you continue on a little squirrel runs past you he stops looks at you you look at him and even if only for a few moments you connect with him your eyes meet the squirrel looks peaceful in this environment content and he's here to simply remind you that in this moment you're content that you can allow thoughts of yesterday and worries or concerns of tomorrow to let go because these are not your reality your reality is only in this present moment this is your reality right here in this forest now this is your reality you feel this wonderful connection with this squirrel and he scampers away you continue on climbing inclines and steeper Hills the river still below you babbling away as you reach the top of the hill you see an enormous pine tree with a wooden rope ladder and you begin to climb this tree you are safe you feel safe up and up you go [Music] beginning to be far above the river and this tree continues on even past the top of the canopy so right now you are up the top of this tree you see a hammock swinging from branch to branch just the perfect size for you and decide to spend some time swinging laying down with in this hammock right above the beautiful lush rainforest you're comforted here and supported and of course safe just enjoy lying here whilst the Sun envelops you soothes you and comfort you [Music] feel the Sun penetrating right deep down into every cell of your entire body energizing you healing you on a deep sea level relaxing you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just as you are enjoying this sunlight this gentle swinging of the hammock from high above the forest and the river a gentle tapping is on your right shoulder and as you open your eyes you see a baby chimpanzee he looks in your eyes with a joyous smile he just gently pat your head for a moment and it's like he's communicating directly to you with no word spoken reminding you of your child within and the joyous times you've had as a child think of how simple it was no concerns no worries no problems just happy within that moment at one particular moment see if you can recall a particular moment as a child when you were happy recall what it felt like see if you can pinpoint where that joy sprung from that excitement and he's here to remind you that this joy this inner child this happiness is always within you and you may sometimes need to take a little more time out to connect with this joy to do what pleases you to do what makes you smile and to look after that little girl or boy that is within you and has always been within you do what makes this little child feel happy and you can carry this back into your waking life the chimpanzee looks at you with a mischievous grin and he bounds away swinging from one vine to the next calling out as he goes you decide to have one last look around at the top of this canopy before you begin to climb back down the wooden rope ladder as you go down thanking the mischievous monkey breeze lessons on your inner child you finally reach the floor of the forest and continue now on your journey beginning to go downhill again getting closer and closer to the riverbank as you continue downwards towards the river you see an old man sitting in the seat it's a carved out wooden log the seat that has probably been here for centuries he's a frail old man and he turns to see you he motioned you to come and sit with him and he has a glint of joy within his eyes he says to you just for this moment be still no thoughts needed just be still and enjoy the sounds of the beautiful rainforest around you and so you sit with him and begin to listen and it's like the sounds of the rainforest a magnified a symphony of nature to your ears just enjoy these next few moments [Applause] you turn to look at the frail old man and he reminds you never be afraid to take time out to do nothing because in that nothingness there is everything that you need contained there you acknowledge this and you say goodbye to the old man and you continue on your journey as you continue on the meandering path alongside the river the sounds of water gushing begin to get louder and louder it seems like there is a large waterfall ahead excitedly you continue to move towards the sound the sound gets louder and begins to wash all over you reverberating through your entire body as you turn a corner a giant waterfall is seen a large cavern behind the 100-foot waterfall water cascading way above your head it's just you here you and the waterfall and nature you edged yourself close to the waterfall and put your arm underneath it you can feel the heaviness of the water as a pounds against your arms and hands it's cool but not too cold you see a little trail that leads behind the cavern of this giant waterfall and you decide to go under this and from here you can see the water pounding right in front of you splashing down to the rocks and the river below this waterfall is here to remind you of the strength you have within any obstacles that come forth in your life but you have this power within to overcome them to see them through no matter how dark these times may be this strength this inner strength can overcome almost any obstacle set before you and if there is an obstacle that can't be moved just like the waterfall it just travels around it and moves onwards not stopping not fearing just continuing to move with the flow of life you are how you are strength just be with this for a moment and allow the water to fall reminding you of all the strength you have all your ever need is right within you right at this moment you head on now back out from under the cabin back in the direction where you came you thank the waterfowl for the reminder as you begin to follow the river back downstream going with the flow of life you continue on with in the forest with the flow of the river passing the old man once more still seated on the carved out wooden chair you acknowledge each other and move on you pass the wooden rope ladder again a chimpanzee the squirrel and just as you begin to get closer to the edge of the forest a Sun shower begins to fall gently down rather than running from this you rejoice in this and look upwards and see this water gently coming down and refreshing you reminding you to surrender to life but whatever comes up for you to not try and force things aside to not try and push motions down [Music] but rather to acknowledge everything that happens and surrender to it allow it to be and this makes your job in life so much easier so much more comfortable and joyous it's almost like you can use life as your playground you don't have to tighten your grip on anything it just be enjoy whatever happens at any point in given time allow it to be and in allowing it to be as it is it gives you so much power and strength you're acknowledging this present moment you won't have to get lost in the past or in the future within your mind these can be waste of time and this is all you have right here and now so just stand here and allow this gentle Sun shower to wash away old thoughts or remaining concern and be truly present coming back now you're leaving the forest as you do take one more moment to glance back and to thank the forest for all it has offered you today but every reminder that it has given you right now you're returning to your body where you can continue on begin to sleep and with the knowing that right now there is nothing else that needs to be done you can sleep be present and allow yourself to enjoy these moments and anything that needs to be done trust that it will be done in the coming days it's all ok it's your time it's your time to rest to rest your body your mind your spirit [Music] sleep well my friend sleep well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you

sleep you will be deeply relaxed thank you so much for joining me today before we get started make sure you are ready to drift off to sleep when this recording is over if you like the relaxing benefits of lavender oil and happen to have some you can rub some on your temples and your pulse points take a moment now to turn off all distractions and pause this recording if there's anything you need to do to prepare yourself for safe and comfortable night sleep know that you are safe and supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you choose to do so as we begin allow your eyes to close gently and focus your attention on your breath imagine the air you are breathing in as a warm glowing light that fills you up and heals you from the inside hold your breath for just a moment allowing this light to go deep down into your belly and then let out that breath gently allowing any physical and emotional attention to leave your body with your exhale again take another deep breath hold it for a short moment and this time take your time with the exhale slowing it down take the next few moments to breathe in this way for three more cycles of breath each cycle allow the exhale to slow down a little more than the breath before it and feel your body soften and your thoughts slow down even more with each passing breath now releasing that breath pattern and allowing your breath to return to its natural rhythm and notice how you are feeling how you're focused breathing pattern has slowed your heart rate is quiet in your mind it has brought about a heavy sense of calm to your physical body with each breath in bring a sense of relaxation into your body and with each breath out breathe out tension being fully present to this moment to your physical body to the sounds around you and to the surface below you set the intention for peace and relaxation for your physical body and for you mentally and spiritually for today open your heart and your mind to the opportunity the state of comfort and mindfulness offers for healing your body know that you are safe and fully supported to release stress and improve your health and well-being as you sleep deeply for the night you take another slow breath in making it your deepest breath yet and as you release that breath feel that the tension in your body has begun to loosen and subside feel that your body is becoming heavy and calm take a moment to be fully present with the physical sensations of your body right now let go of distractions let go of your responsibilities let go of expectations of what you might think this experience should be and simply surrender to the process of relaxation notice what you are feeling without changing or judging just notice you might feel a light tingling sensation in the palms or a floating sensation in your body that comes and goes or you may feel a comforting heaviness throughout your body you may begin to notice it feels as if there is no difference between where your body ends and where the surface below you begins whatever you're feeling is perfect and you just observe the feelings and sensations as you allow yourself to enjoy this journey allow yourself to turn the whole world off and to go within with my voice as a guide to deep sleep in a moment now I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the top of your head going all the way through your body to your feet as you see each part of your body in your mind's eye you will relax that body part completely and as you move your attention throughout the body you will scan for any areas of tension tightness or pain if there are areas of tension you will stay on that part of your body for a moment and breathe in the warm healing light right into that area to soften it you will ask your body to relax and release and this warm loving light will melt the tension away from your body and allow you to fully relax as you continue scanning your body you will feel this relaxing and healing energy move through you as it takes you deeper and deeper into a safe and supported state of sleep and recovery as this light passes over your body it progressively relaxed as you and releases each muscle small and large and now let's begin the slow process of relaxing the entire body to prepare for a deep and productive sleep for the night now begin to ask for release from your scalp and head and feel your forehead soften and smooth the tiny muscles around your eyebrows melt and you can allow the tension from the day to dissolve from your face peel your eyelids becoming very heavy part your teeth unclench your jaw and relax your tongue this softening of your faith and Jah will deepen the relaxation of your entire body you can now feel your throat softening and you notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper allowing this wave of comfort to continue its journey down your body you feel your chest and shoulders release and rest heavy every breath in brings healing air into your belly and allows the abdomen to let go even further and now allow both arms to relax and feel as all of the tension from your upper body flows out through your fingertips and as you continue to breathe in fresh healing oxygen into your chest and abdomen your body is able to use this oxygen to recover and repair from your activities of daily life and now inviting the relaxation to continue its path down your body into your hips and lower back linger on this area a little longer and ask your body for a sense of ease let go of all the tension held in this area feel your body softening as each in-breath creates space for an easy flow of energy through your body this comfort moves into both of your legs washing relaxation over your thighs your knees and your calves and you feel any remaining tension tightness or pain flush out of your body through the bottoms of your feet so that you are completely relaxed throughout your entire body know that your relaxed body will allow for a productive recovery while you sleep so you all wake feeling refreshed and rejuvenated after a good night's sleep you are now deeply relaxed and you can begin to use your imagination to visualize yourself from the outside as if you are an observer looking down at yourself lying in your bed and your very own room I will guide you on a journey taking you into a dream state and you can simply follow my voice or drift off to sleep whenever you are ready see yourself right where you are in your own bed in your own room but imagine now that your room has a moonroof just like a car it's able to slide open with the push of a button in your mind see as your ceiling begins to slowly open right above your bed so that it begins to reveal the open night sky directly above you you are still nice and cozy in your bed completely safe and supported and now you can look up into the night sky and see all of the many stars shining bright you can see the moon lit up above you and the clouds passing by as each cloud passes by you notice the thoughts in your head going along with them and your body becomes more and more relaxed as each one passes by you can feel all of the tension from the day leaving your body and your mind with each cloud as well and now find the brightest star in the sky and bring your attention to that star only bring this brightest star in the sky into full focus and allow the rest of the background to blur slightly in your vision in this dream state continue for the next few moments to focus your attention on the one brightest star in the sky you in your mind allow your gaze to soften and your attention can now brought in to the bigger picture of the sky with all of the stars in it and in a moment I will guide you to count the stars above you beginning from 10 counting down to 1 and with each star you count you will get deeper and deeper into relaxation and into the comfortable state of sleep and now begin to count the stars in the sky to take you into a deep sleep ten you are deeply relaxed you feel the tension melting away 9 you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do and you allow yourself to just be as you drift off into a comfortable sleep eight notice how you are feeling a deeper sense of relaxation you are beginning to feel sleepy seven you invite this blissful relaxed state to wash over you six you can feel your body begin the recovery and healing process that accompanies deep sleep five let it go completely of the need to hold on to any tension or to guard physically for drifting deeper and deeper into the familiar heavy state of comfort three almost to the deepest level of relaxation before you fall off to sleep - deep deep relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and heavy comfort now that you are relaxed and safe allow your body to do what it knows exactly how to do and begin the process of recovering from your activities of daily living allow this rejuvenation to wash over you like a wave you know that taking this time for yourself as helping your body to

1 Music] hello my name is jason stevenson and welcome to this short guided meditation that will facilitate your release of any negative or limiting thoughts that no longer serve you it's time to let go of whatever has been holding you back to begin this transformative practice bring yourself to a comfortable seated position either on the floor on a bench or in a chair and wherever you find yourself straightening your spine and let your heart space open up ever so gently and allow your shoulders to drop closing your eyes when you're ready [Music] let's take a few moments now to settle in by drawing our attention to the breath [Music] and simply observe any sensations associated with each inward and each outward movement [Music] you might notice the temperature of the air as it enters your nostrils the feeling of the belly expanding and softening or a general sense of relaxation moving through your body [Music] and now with each breath that enters your lungs i invite you to envision revitalized energy mingling with your cellular body and with each breath that departs imagine any unsupportive energy being released so breathing in fresh energy full of renewed vitality and breathe out whatever is calling to be surrendered now i invite you to enter into a visual journey of transformation by imagining that you are standing at the foot of a wooded mountain beneath you your feet root into the rich soil footpath and all around evergreen trees stretch up towards the cosmos [Music] your nose picks up the scent of the pine infused aroma of these woods cleansing you from within with each full breath you take [Music] and before you the footpath weaves its way through the forest up towards the mountain's peak eager to begin this journey of transformation and release you take your first few steps in the direction of the summit above [Music] as you walk you feel life's vital energy flowing through you your body is engaged your mind is focused and your breath begins to deepen along your journey through the forest that blankets the slope of the mountain you admire the qualities you observe in this natural landscape the resilience the strength the adaptability and the beauty of the wildlife that is abundant here as you admire these qualities in the world outside of you you begin to realize that they reflect what is innately present within you too as you continue to hike towards the peak you feel this truth permeating more deeply with hours passing that feel as though they were sheer minutes the land beneath you begins to level out as the earth plateaus you make your way through the final stretch of trees before emerging onto the flat rock of this majestic mountain's peak you breathe in and release a deep sigh your jaw drops and your heart widens to the beauty of the world that extends around you valleys rivers lakes and forests down below reach out in all directions you are witnessing the world from this heightened perspective as if for the very first time and as the gentle breeze rushes against your skin you remember your intention for coming here to release what no longer serves you and to welcome the winds of change that will propel you forward and so here standing upon the mountaintop you let come to mind any and all of the negative thoughts that no longer serve you when they arise they do not stay with you for long as you surrender them up to the wind that dances through the atmosphere all around you surrender with the breath exhalation by exhalation each thought each feeling and every negative knot of energy that holds you back from realizing your true potential let the wind carry them away from you leaving you vibrantly alive [Music] allow the muscles around your eyes to relax now and your attention to land in the center of your heart and as you gaze out upon the wonder of the world above below and all around you silently set an intention to nourish yourself with positive thoughts in the minutes hours and days to come take one more long deep breath in here and when you release let go of any residual negative energy with a deep sigh let it out [Music] slowly now let the imagery of this landscape begin to fade from your mind's eye as you come back to the natural rhythm of your breathing tune into your body into the earth supporting you from below and when you are ready you can gently let the light seep back into your eyes as they slowly open [Music] and as you move through the day ahead let yourself be empowered by the transformation and release that you've experienced in this practice today allow the winds of inspired change continue to awaken and guide you many blessings you
1 [Music] hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will take you on a journey to your inner child as you encounter the child within you'll be guided into developing a more loving freeing and forgiving relationship with this aspect of self then you may previously have had my name is Jason Stephenson and thank you for joining me tonight allow your heart to open to this transformative process as you develop perhaps a new or reimagined way of relating to that child within so to begin take your time to find a comfortable resting position where you can settle in for the night ahead [Music] ensure that your spine is as straight as possible they're still relaxed and allow your limbs to rest comfortably and naturally with your eyes closed take a few moments to reconnect with your breath simply notice the way it waxes and wanes through the body soften your brow [Music] you're turning your jaw and your belly as you settle deeper into the space that holds you [Music] and see if you might allow the stomach to rise and fall to its fullest capacity with each breath with each in-breath the belly extends with ease and with each breath out it gently falls back down [Music] extending with ease as it feels and falling gently as it empties now before we take a journey to meet the inner child let us ground ourselves in compassion patience and care each one of us has a unique relationship to our inner child and sometimes it is a challenging one for this reason it is important that we establish ourselves in love before moving further so take a moment now to draw your attention to the heart space watching as the breath flows into and out of this loving center of your body you might imagine that each inhalation feeds your inner capacity for love and that each breath out softens any resistance to self-love and care and as you breathe through the heart take a few moments to reaffirm the following sentiments that will support you on your journey I am patient and gentle with myself [Music] I care for and embrace my innermost self I support myself unconditionally I am grounded in love and compassion let these words dissipate into the background as you sink into this energy of loving-kindness continue to mind the breath remembering that each inhalation fuels you and that each exhalation frees you of what is no longer required and as we move through this journey know that your experience will be as unique as you and your inner child are for some this process might be difficult know that as you move through this you are always encouraged to follow your own inner guidance so be sure to do whatever you need to do to support yourself just allow my words to guide you and remember that you can always come back to the breath to ground you [Music] before we move into this visualization let's take three deep cleansing breaths together begin by letting your last inhalation leave the body completely and then take a deep full breath in for the count of four and then slowly exhale for a count of six another deep breath in for a slow count of four and when you've reached the top slowly exhale for a count of six one last breath in for four and let it back out for six [Music] and allowing your breath to come back to its natural rhythm as you sink into the surface beneath you use your breath as an anchor whenever you need it to tether you back into this present moment now let all unnecessary tension slowly begin to dissolve into the space that supports you allow yourself to be held here unconditionally to begin this visual journey turn your attention towards your mind's eye and imagine yourself standing in a deep lush evergreen forest your feet are firmly rooted in a pressed Earth pathway that weaves through the trees and all around you majestic aspen spruce and pine trees climb up into the clear blue sky [Music] your spine is straight your chest is open and your shoulders are relaxed and as you breathe you do so deeply welcoming the cleansing pine infused air into the depths of your lungs you exhale with a soft sigh letting go of anything that does not serve you here [Music] take three full deep breaths at your own pace now letting the crisp and clean forest air cleanse mind body and soul you [Music] and after your third deep breath you begin your journey ahead step-by-step you make your way through the enchanted forest that holds you the air is a comfortable temperature keeping you both warm and refreshed observe the colors and textures that fill your eyesight as you pass through this landscape what shapes do the trees take what hues appear in the leaves the trunks of the trees and any other plant life that thrives here [Music] what richness and diversity is apparent to you [Music] the further you venture the more settled you feel this flourishing ecosystem holds you as one of its own leading you gently onwards down your own path of healing it's not long before there is a break in the trees and you step out of the woods upon the site of a magnificent shimmering lake your shoulders drop even further from your ears as your soul is stirred by this body of water you approach the water's edge slowly inching your way towards the rocky shoreline that surrounds it the still water loves you right up to its edge and so you take a seat on the smooth rock face overlooking the water to rest for a while [Music] [Music] the Sun inches its way towards the treeline inviting a car and wrested energy to the fading day the wind is barely traceable and the flat water sparkles beneath the Setting Sun all is well as you gaze across the water you realize you feel deeply content in this space and time there is nothing missing from this moment and yet your heart is wide open to whatever might come your way you feel strong stable and secure in who and where you are remaining seated here something draws your attention down the shore that leads into the Setting Sun some distance away you notice someone making their way towards you it is a young person perhaps five or six years of age though their exact age is entirely up to you this individual slowly makes their way closer and closer to you until soon you realize that the person approaching is you it is you from some many years ago it is the child within the child that has always kept some space within you [Music] they're returning to you and you to them [Music] take a moment to fully notice this child let your heart be completely open to their presence regardless of how they've shown up today [Music] [Music] this child moves carefully and as they come within a few meters distance you offer a few words of kindness and invite them to come and sit next to you knowing they're safe in this visualization they come to take a seat in front of you you begin this interaction simply by extending the warmth of your heart onto this small person before you grounded in a wisdom and self compassion that they have yet to develop you hold this energy for them simply through your presence you offer them your unconditional acceptance [Music] meeting their eyes you take in the heart and soul of this child and you ask them if there is anything on their heart or mind [Music] leave plenty of space for what arises and if or as they speak listen without judgment simply hold space but whatever it is they are feeling know also that it is okay if they do not have any words to say your inner child may speak through nonverbal language and in the face of whatever arises whether that be fear joy anger grief guilt playfulness or anything else you offer them your love you offer this child your compassion without expectation and without condition let yourself be there Rock as steady as the physical rock beneath you you nurture them in whatever way feels most comfortable for the two of you perhaps that is through a big hug or through hands held tightly or perhaps it is simply through holding the space for one another know that there is no right or wrong way to nurture your inner child here [Music] [Music] and then ask your inner child if there is something they'd like your help with is there something they'd like you to set free for them is there something they would like you to forgive [Music] let this child know that they have your unconditional support in releasing anything that does not serve their sense of happiness and wholeness you as their wise elder can offer them the love support and forgiveness that they've been yearning for [Music] and now in the silent space that holds you both next to the lake you might silently repeat to them I see you I hear you I love you I am here for you I support you I forgive you I honor you I embrace you I free you take some more time now to fully embrace this in a child through your loving presence through hands held or through a warm and caring hug let this child be held by your love and by your strength [Music] let this child take the time they need to feel as they feel reminding them that you are not here to change them you are simply here to listen and to support [Music] and as they feel heard the inner world begins to quiet as does your own soon the two of you sit peacefully and contently gazing out over the calm waters of the lake at dusk [Music] The Sun has disappeared behind the trees and a warm orange glow stretches across the horizon the sky above is ocean blue slowly deepening its turn as the day fades away you and your inner child look towards one another and smile you were grateful for this moment and for this opportunity to reconnect [Music] you and as the colors of the sky signal that it is almost time for slumber you ask your inner child where they like to rest for the night perhaps they yearn to go to bed in a place from your shared past perhaps they longed to slumber beneath the open starry sky or perhaps they would find the most peace the most happiness falling asleep in some imagined land that inspires them wherever your inner child finds peace and comfort let them know you will guide them there [Music] and then slowly slowly letting the landscape in your mind transform call to mind the place where they know they will rest with the most ease [Music] imagine what this place looks like and what comforts it holds wherever you find yourself invite your inner child to settle into a cozy and comfortable bed for the night you tuck them in with love and care reminding them that you are always here for them and as they surrender into the night you whisper the words I love you I am here for you I love you I am here for you I [Music] love you [Music] I am here for you [Music] spend a few more silent moments whispering these words to your inner child perhaps aligning the words I love you with your inhalations and I'm here for you with your exhalations the inner child drifts off to sleep and you are left with the revitalized sense of love and care for this part of yourself you set an intention now that when the signs of this inner child arise in you in the future you will tend to them with unconditional patience presence love and compassion [Music] now you two are ready to surrender into sleep and so you come back to your body letting the evenings visualizations gently begin to dissipate [Music] notice the felt sense of your body being supported by the bed or other surface beneath you what does it feel like to be held here [Music] notice the breath as it flows through you creating an expansion and a softening with each full cycle and then draw your attention to the heart space once again connecting with the center of your compassion for one last time before drifting into sleep [Music] and as you hold your attention here imagine a small white light beginning to appear in the center of your chest it expands outwards with each second that goes by and as it permeates through your body it offers its a loving energy to each cell that it passes [Music] soon your entire body is held in this healing white light arising from within it nurtures every part of you the present self the past self and the future self all at the same time [Music] spend just a few more moments now feeling yourself as you were bathed in this warm glow [Music] and when you were ready slowly let that light dissipate come back to the felt sense of your body in this space let yourself connect intimately with the earth that supports you here and then let your attention come back to the breath noting this natural movement as it passes through you if there is anything else that needs to be released let it out now with a deep sigh [Music] allow your breath to be an anchor for your awareness as you slowly drift into slumber sleep well my friend sleep well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 hello this is Sara Raymond with the mindful movement welcome to this guided sleep meditation to help you prepare for a deep and relaxing night's sleep we will also focus on inviting in abundance to your life first I will guide you through a complete body and mind relaxation that will bring about a sense of calmness and allow your subconscious mind to let go of anything blocking the flow of abundance to you then you will hear suggestions to invite abundance into your life in any way that you desire the mindset of abundance is the opposite of scarcity abundance is the overflowing and over sufficient quantity of that which you desire and you have the power to invite it into your life what you are thinking about right before you fall asleep will set the tone for the quality of your sleep and your mindset for the next day you have the choice to change the way that you look at things before we get started make sure you are ready to drift off to sleep if you like when this recording is over if you like the relaxing benefits of lavender oil and happen to have some you can rub some on your temples or your pulse points or perhaps diffuse it into the air or spray a light mist on your pillow make your environment as dark and relaxing as possible take a moment now to turn off all distractions and pause this recording if there's anything you need to prepare yourself for a safe and comfortable night's sleep know that you are safe and supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you choose to do so now that you have prepared your surroundings welcome a sense of relaxation and peace into your mind and body invite it in as if you are welcoming an old friend as we begin allow your eyes to close gently and focus your attention on your breath by simply being mindful and intentional with your breath your body sends a signal to your brain that you are safe and can move into rest and digest mode now begin to deepen your breath take a full breath in to fill up from your belly up to your ribs and into your chest and hold your breath for just a moment [Music] and let out your breath gently allowing any physical and emotional tension to leave your body with your exhale again take another deep breath hold it for a short moment and this time take your time with the exhale slowing it down so that it lasts just a little longer than the inhale take the next few moments to mindfully breathe in this way encouraging each exhale to be just a bit longer than the inhale to signal the body to relax each breath cycle allow the exhale to slow down a little more than the breath before it and feel your body soften and your thoughts slow down even more with each slow deep breath now release that breath pattern and allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and flow notice how you were feeling while you're short and focused breath practice has slowed your heart rate it has quieted your mind it has brought about a heavy sense of calm to your physical body [Music] notice the natural rhythm of your breath and feel the sensations that accompany your breath perhaps you feel a slightly cool sensation as the air passes through your nostrils maybe you feel a floating sensation as your abdomen and chest rise and fill with breath or a heaviness as the air moves out of your body taking any tension with it maybe the breath brings a warming sensation to the body as it travels along its path whatever you're feeling is perfect simply observe the process this process of relaxation is not about what you are feeling but that you are being curious and looking [Music] as you continue to attend to the sensations in the body associated with your breath let go of distractions let go of your responsibilities let go of expectations of what you think this experience should be and surrender to the process of relaxation simply notice what you are feeling without changing or judging just notice invite in the feeling of peace as you tune out the whole world around you and go within with my voice as a soothing guide to help you move towards sleep in a moment now I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the top of your head moving all the way down through your feet as I say each part of your body see that part in your mind's eye and you can relax that body part completely [Music] welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind encourage the weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface below you so that there is no need to hold on you can simply let go into sleep there is no need to follow my voice for the entire recording your subconscious mind will hear me as you drift into sleep now as we begin to scan the body bring your attention to the top of your head intend to feel this area from the inside of your body as sensations only without moving your eyes as you scan your body simply move your awareness to each part and you will relax that body part completely let's begin this relaxation process with the scalp welcoming ease into the forehead and eyes allow the release of any facial expression to soften the lines of your face relax the tiny muscles around your eyes and feel as your eyelids become heavy allow your cheeks to soften your jaw to unclench and your neck to relax completely as each muscle relaxants in progression it invites a deeper sense of relaxation to the parts of your body that came before in our body scan continuing this cumulative relaxation process as you invite a sense of peace and stillness to your shoulders chest and arms perhaps feeling a relaxed heaviness move into your ribs abdomen and back let go of any gripping in your hips as your thighs rest heavy on the surface below you as if there is no difference between where you end and where the surface below you begins you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part allows it to relax and let go finally since your ankles and feet releasing and relaxing completely [Music] take another moment to slowly scan your body once more this time notice any areas that may still be holding on to any lingering tension and ask your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe and supported and knows exactly what to do to relax if you simply allow the tension to release now they were fully relaxed I will guide you on a journey this journey will take you on a path to release any negative beliefs or ideas that could be holding you back from the abundance you desire then you will bring in the energy of abundance into the space you create for it when you let go of fears I invite you to open your imagination and step into a field of beautiful wildflowers look around at this field of wildflowers as you stand on a path that leads you right down the center of the field here you are surrounded on both sides by flowers and the most vivid colors use your senses to take in this beautiful and peaceful environment around you see the clear bright sky above you feel that the temperature of the air is perfect just for you and the Sun shines on you gently warming your skin the faint smell of the flowers is just right for your liking perhaps you hear birds chirping in the distance or see butterflies flitting around as you look around you can see many beautiful colors in all directions around you you sense that you are safe and peaceful in this place in your imagination that is just right for you [Music] you begin to walk along this path down the center of the field moving towards some rolling hills where you see even more wildflowers as you walk you have a feeling that you are carrying around something extra something weighing you down something making you feel heavy and tired you reach into your pockets and feel that surprisingly there are some smooth stones there these stones that you are carrying around weighing you down [Music] represent your fears and your feelings of not enough they represent anything known or unknown to you that is holding you back each stone is something that is blocking the flow of abundance to you slowly take one stone out of your pocket and leave it on the path behind you as you continue walking forwards feel that a space has opened up inside of you as you let go of something negative in your life there's no need to label what you are letting go of simply let go knowing that it's something that no longer serves you or support your goals and desires for abundance continue to do the same with each of the remaining stones in your pocket one at a time take your time and feel the energetic shift from negative to positive feel the space you have opened up for the flow of abundance now that you have let go of that which no longer serves you you have made room for the flow of abundance invited in letting go of resistance gives way to an attitude of allowing allow in positive energy thoughts and beliefs allow in gratitude love and abundance feel this flow of positive energy within you and it is magnetically attracted back to you take a moment and sense this energy and positive feeling [Music] as you look around at the field of flowers now you can see possibilities and abundance everywhere you look each of the flowers around you grow from a seed each seed had everything it needed within it to become the flower that it is and each flower has the seeds to become many more flowers and on and on the cycle goes much like these flowers grown from seeds you to have everything you need within you to have the life of your dreams and to attract the abundance in your life that you desire the abundance of the flowers around you represents abundance in your life now call to mind a part of your life that you would like to see a flow of abundance visualize this component of your life exactly as you want it to be feel how it would feel as if this was already true for you soak in the feelings in this present moment the things you think about right before drifting off to sleep color your thoughts as you sleep and for the day ahead in a moment I will guide your subconscious with some positive affirmation statements inviting the flow of abundance into your life there is no need to repeat these if you are so relaxed you are almost sleeping your subconscious will hear them simply believe they are true I acknowledge the positive things in my life I expressed the feeling of gratitude often for the blessings in my life I love myself and believe I am worthy of abundance to flow to me I allow the flow of abundance in all aspects of my life I attract success and abundance I radiate out positive loving energy and that is what comes back to me I take action towards my goals of abundance every day I let go of negative influences and energies that do not serve me I know that abundance is unlimited and that my abundance will benefit others I am generous and give my unique gifts to the world and now you have prepared your mind in your body for a deep and restful night's sleep your subconscious mind is open to allow the flow of abundance to you you're a relaxed and feel a sense of lightness and spaciousness as you have let go of anything weighing you down sleep is inviting you to let go and surrender to your dreams allow this to happen if you wish take the final steps into a deep and restful slumber as you

1 welcome this guided meditation is to help you sue the feelings of anxiety before bed so that you can fall asleep easily and have a peaceful night's sleep meditation before bed is a wonderful way to quiet the racing thoughts and to get ready for the day or week ahead please do not use this as a substitute for seeking the advice of a medical professional if necessary the mind is a complex process sometimes we find ourselves overwhelmed by where our mind can take us ideally as we become more self-aware through our practice we learn how to use our mind as a tool many of us have difficulty with this concept or have not yet begun that path when our mind uses us instead it can lead us in various directions when this happens we are subject to the reactions we may have to our thoughts and our life situations this is often what triggers feelings of anxiety when our mind takes us to future moments we can feel worried or even panic over what's to come anxiety is on some level living in the future nothing ever happens in the future though everything happens in the present moment getting in touch with the present moment and the timeless beauty of the now and accepting it fully with love and non judgment that is where the answer to anxiety lies many people deal with feelings of anxiety on a regular basis understanding some of the details on a basic level can help set your path towards an anxiety free life first of all anxiety cannot hurt you even though it might feel otherwise in the moment it is important to recognize this it is basically a shift in activity in the brain from one area to another it may create physical symptoms that appear at times quite severe it can even replicate feeling similar to a real physical concern being able to recognize these feelings for what they are just a temporary shift towards the sympathetic nervous system also known as the fight-or-flight response is a powerful step towards healing [Music] once we understand and truly believe that these feelings no matter how powerful can do us no harm we can accept them without judgment in fact as an observer of our bodies we want to welcome these feelings oftentimes it's the fear of anxiety that triggers further anxious sensations if we truly do not fear them they will begin to dissolve welcome them as The Watcher of your body as if you are expecting these feelings see these feelings as a teaching tool as though you are completely okay with them smile at them smile with every cell in your body and as your love shines its light the darkness will fade oftentimes this anxiety creeps up around bedtime when we begin to consider what's in store for the next day or the week ahead it is the idea of living in the future today I will invite you into your present moment to let go of the past and have confidence in what the future holds I will guide you to attend to your breath and your physical sensations in this present moment with this practice you can peacefully drift off to sleep take a moment and make sure you are in a safe place to drift off to sleep if you choose if you need to pause this video that's okay [Music] make sure your room is dark and you are very comfortable if you are listening to this on an electronic device turn the screens light away from you create the most comfortable environment that you can [Music] once you are ready to begin the journey to sleep bring your attention to your breath and invite the feeling of settling into your space knowing you are exactly where you need to be I'm going to count to three and then I would like you to take a deep breath in through your nose and as you exhale gently close your eyes and soften your body one two three [Music] let's repeat that cycle two more times gently open your eyes one two three breathe in deeply and relax on your exhale letting your eyes close one more time softly open your eyes one two three breathe in deep and relax letting your eyes shut down and your whole body relaxed and with your eyes closed now allow your breath to become natural [Music] knowing that the body knows what to do to breathe to relax and to recover and rejuvenate while you sleep and now simply be aware of the sensations in your body that are associated with the natural rhythm of your breath [Music] notice the cool air of the passes into your nostrils and how the air is a little warmer as it flows out of your body feel as the chest and belly rise and fall and rhythm with the breath [Music] as you continue breathing naturally begin to sense the pause that occurs between the exhale and the next inhale keep your attention on this momentary pause for the next few breaths using this pause to come back to each present moment use this pause to let go of the worry about the future to let go of the need for perfection to let go of the shoulds [Music] if your attention drifts away from your breath which it likely will noticing a sound or a thought or a physical sensation lovingly return your attention to the next breath and the next pause continue focusing on your breath as you invite your body to soften and reacts each natural exhale takes you deeper into relaxation and closer to peaceful sleep allow yourself to let go of all the stress from your day let go of your to-do list for the future and now gently move your attention to your body first focus your attention on your face as you exhale let go of all the muscles of your face [Music] relax your forehead relax the tiny muscles around your eyes and your cheeks unclench your jaw and think into the surface below you continue to watch your breath as you let go of the muscles in your neck and your shoulders [Music] relax your arms relax your back [Music] let go of all of the muscles in your belly and your hips let go of any tension in your legs invite the sensation of relaxation to let everything go you are now very relaxed you are feeling very comfortable and you are enjoying a sense of inner peace that is soothing and quieting

tension to leave your body with your exhale again take another deep breath hold for a short moment and this time take your time with the exhale slowing it down so that it lasts just a little longer than the inhale take the next few moments to mindfully breathe in this way encouraging each exhale to be just a bit longer than the inhale to signal the body to relax each breath cycle allow the exhale to slow down a little more than the breath before it and feel your body soften and your thoughts slow down even more with each slow deep breath [Music] become aware of your whole body in your

in your mind's eye with your attention and intention relax each body part completely [Music] welcome the sense of ease throughout your entire body and mind [Music] encourage the weight of your body to

perhaps feeling a comfortable heaviness move into your ribs abdomen and back [Music] let go of any gripping in your hips and allow your thighs to rest heavy on the surface below you as if there is no difference between where you end and the surface begins you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a body part allows it to relax and let go [Music] since your ankles and feet relaxing completely take another moment to slowly scan your body once more this time notice any areas that may still be holding on to any lingering tension and ask your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe and supported and knows what to do to relax if you simply allow the tension to release [Music] when your body is relaxed there is space for dreams and possibilities to arise you can more easily connect with your authentic self and your true desires [Music] as you continue to relax I will guide you through a manifesting visualization this practice is not about perfection or about reaching completion this is the planting of seeds and shifting of mindset towards the belief that you deserve that which you desire this is about experiencing faith while things may not feel aligned with the life of your dreams just yet that's okay [Music] simply work with what you have and begin to move towards what you want you can't change the past so be careful not to dwell there or attach expectations based on the past as you imagine the outcome of your manifestation you may see vivid pictures in your mind or you may find emotions arising within you you may have specific answers to some questions or they may come later connect with everything that is coming up for you today and open your awareness to the possibilities as they arise in the future now remaining relaxed and grounded begin to think about what it is that you want [Music] see it in vivid detail if possible as if you are watching a movie or perhaps here what you want in your head as if it is a story being told imagine this as if it is true for you right now feel it in your body as truth experience as much detail as is available to you right now [Music] what feelings and emotions would you have more of in your life in this vision what are the values and beliefs that are important to you that will allow you to manifest your desires [Music] visualize both the outcome and the process to get there if it is clear without getting attached to either [Music] [Music] these feelings from your visualization are already within you you can choose to call upon the feelings anytime you can create any life you want your dreams are within your grasp when you choose to reach connect with what is showing up for you now breathe it in remain connected with the positive excited state of this visualization stay connected with the building energy of possibilities for the future and at the same time become aware of what you want and why you may not believe that you can have it be mindful of this inner conflict where part of you may be thinking you cannot have what you want you don't deserve it or that it is impossible do not fight these thoughts away accept them don't stay here too long without judgment let go of your past beliefs that could be holding you back perhaps visualize letting go of a leaf into a moving River see your limiting beliefs go now that you have let go of that which no longer serves you you have made room for the flow of energy for manifesting letting go of resistance gives way to an attitude of allowing allow in positive energy thoughts and beliefs allow in gratitude love and abundance feel this flow of energy within you and it is magnetically attracted back to you [Music] take a moment to sense this energy and positive feeling now consider and accept all the positive reasons why you do deserve what you want why you will get it and what you will experience when you manifest your desires stay here a bit longer see possibilities within you and everywhere you look [Music] it is important to acknowledge both the good and the bad although you will make sure you have accepted all the positives and the negatives let go of the negatives and focus on the positives here for a moment think of this as watering the flowers rather than the weeds we can manifest what we focus on what we believe in and what we have faith can happen in a moment I will guide your subconscious with some positive statements inviting the flow of abundance into your life there is no need to repeat these if you are so relaxed you are almost sleeping your subconscious will hear them simply believe they are true I see the world as a positive and friendly place where good things happen I acknowledge the positive in my life [Music] I expressed the feeling of gratitude often for the blessings in my life I love myself and believe I am worthy of that which I desire I allow the flow of abundance in all aspects of my life I radiate positive loving energy and that is what comes back to me I take action towards my goals every day [Music] I let go of negative energy that does not serve me I know that the possibilities are unlimited and available to me I let go of the obstacles between myself and that which I desire I know abundance and success are within me [Music] I see myself as a person of success and abundance [Music] I am strongly connected to what is important to me I am patient on this journey of change and growth [Music] I see the world as a positive and friendly place where good things

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will focus on inner clearing forgiveness and the Hawaiian prayer our pono pono my name is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to gently open your heart as you move with me through this deeply healing and restorative practice and closing your eyes if you've not done so then explore what it feels like to fully arrive here and to arrive in this sense means simply to let your mind join your body to set aside for the time being any notions about the past or the future you can help your mind to arrive here by tuning into the surface beneath your body or by holding your entire being in open awareness establishing this sense of presence will anchor you as you journey through this practice of clearing away any past mistakes wrongdoings and resentments because as we surrender into this moment it becomes more natural to surrender any inner workings that prevent us from living in the name of love patience forgiveness and understanding now let your attention land on the breaths flow if it's not already there and simply mind this natural movement of lifeforce as you ground into this practice for a few more moments a few more breaths [Music] let each inhalation create an inner expansion and each exhalation and inner softening [Music] the Hawaiian prayer our pono pono is a practice of healing and clearing through forgiveness translated this term can be understood to mean to make right or to correct some definitions even refer to it as a mental and emotional cleansing during this practice we will explore the power of forgiveness by first easing the physical body and then moving into a guided visualization for a deeper level of mental and emotional clearing we will finish this practice with a repeated ho'oponopono mantra as you gently surrender into a good night's sleep so I invite you now to take a moment to come back to the physical body simply noting what it is like to be in the present space that you occupy and as you are guided through the physical body I invite you to bring your loving awareness to each area that we pass as you inhale into each corner of the body bring a healing white light or a sense of love to that area and as you exhale let it soften into the present moment so beginning now at your toes holding them in your full awareness breathe loving energy into these parts of you sending the breath all the way down and then exhale to let any tension here dissipate and moving up now to your ankles breathing in deeply down into your ankles and releasing your calves and shins sending the breath down and releasing softening moving up to your knees breathing in breathing out your thighs and your hamstrings [Music] and shifting the focus to your pelvis and your hips breathing in and on the breath out softening your belly and your lower back [Music] and then moving up to your spy into your chest and your upper back [Music] now draw your attention to your fingertips breathing light or love into your entire hands and releasing on the out-breath continuing with your wrists your lower arms your elbows [Music] moving up to your upper arms breathing in breathing out and release and your shoulders breathing in loving energy into your throat area and soften as you exhale continue with your jaw and your mouth [Music] your cheeks ears and nose you your third eye area between your two eyebrows [Music] and then finish by breathing this way into the crown of your head hold your entire body in your awareness now for a few more grounding breaths before we move deeper into this process of clearing you might imagine that your entire body is being bathed in a white light one that frees you of any inhibiting physical tension and then gently let that white light dissipate in your own time now this will be a journey of clearing and forgiveness and while on the other side of these processes is deep peace and love the journey itself may be challenging for some depending upon how you find yourself in this moment offering yourself or others forgiveness may cause difficult emotions to arise if this turns out to be the case for you tonight remember that you can always come back to your breath or your body to ground yourself let your heart journey as deep as it is meant to be in this moment knowing that you are universally supported so take a moment to find yourself standing outside of a home or cabin that feels safe comfortable and welcoming to you it might be a home that you know or one that the mind creates in either case observe what its exterior looks like what is it made of what is the surrounding environment like what about this abode that warms the heart and soul take a few moments to cultivate an image of this home in your mind letting it bring you a sense of safety and peace [Music] this home has shown up view today to serve as a symbol for coming home to yourself it represents a return to the love support and care that is within you and so before you make your way inside take a moment to set an intention to love care for and support yourself unconditionally and now as you reach your hand for the door handle you slowly turn pull and make your way inside standing in the front hallway you feel an immense sense of relief and gratitude wash over you the home is exactly what you imagined it would be when you stood outside of it a sanctuary full of love light and beauty that also lives at the very core of your being take a moment to imagine what this hallway looks like what colors are its walls what details and accents does it boast what artwork adorns it now you slowly walk down the drifting main hallway soon arriving in a living space that is warm at ease and full of soul and charm it contains details both large and small that bring you a sense of coming home to yourself this room is a perfect reflection of who you are at your loving core take a few moments now to paint in your mind's eye [Music] notice the windows the light and the energy that this room holds imagine now that alongside one wall of this room is a mirror tall and wide it reflects back the entire room into the onlookers eyes depending upon what angle it is approached at something about this mirror is mesmerizing and then you notice that just in front of it cushions and blankets rest as if it's been waiting for you slowly and mindfully you make your way over to this little oasis within the soulful room you've designed taking a seat upon the blankets and cushions presented here you settle in straightening the spine as much as comfortable and letting the shoulders relaxed your jaw softens as does your forehead and belly and then you meet your own eyes in the shimmering mirror as you stare into your own reflection take a moment to simulate a knee ously hold your heart in your awareness let the loving compassionate energy of your heart be the source of the healing or clearing that is possible here and as you hold your own gaze in this mirror you sense that you are returning to yourself how long you wonder has it been since you've been this lovingly attuned to your own inner reflection and yet while love is indeed present here you might find that limiting judgements about who you are or where you've been come up to the surface because sometimes when we attempt to love cherish or accept ourselves the mind rises with its whispers of resistance often these inner judgmental whispers are subtle and yet they can have such a strong effect on how much love forgiveness and kindness we are able to grant ourselves [Music] so in order to clear whatever stories thoughts or beliefs that may be holding you back from unconditional self-acceptance and reconciliation with your true self you look at yourself in the mirror as you slowly repeat these words I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you [Music] I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you spend some time now on your own in silence cultivating these words and an energy of deep care and consideration for yourself as you whisper these words I love you I'm sorry please forgive me and thank you invisible knots of resentment judgment and wrongdoing begin to untangle themselves from your body your body becomes lighter your mind becomes freer and your heart becomes more loving [Music] whatever you may hold against yourself and whatever you may have done in the past does not define who you really are beneath the wise and loving energy of forgiveness you are able to clear yourself you repeat these affirmations three more times now each I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you [Music] I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me [Music] thank you [Music] now the words dissipate into the atmosphere around you as you come back to the quiet space with him you meet your reflection in the mirror once again feeling a wave of gratitude washed through you you are grateful for the energies of love kindness and forgiveness is showing up today and you are grateful for this return to yourself for this inner reconciliation if you need some more time to connect with your loving center imagine yourself resting a hand upon your heart and breathing into that space each inhalation brings a wave of self-love and each exhalation frees you from the entanglement of judgment resentment and the past you take one last look in the mirror and then you turn away from it and back towards the beautiful room that holds you and as you rest here grounded in both the earth and in your heart take a moment to consider if there is anyone you might like to offer this loving forgiving and clearing energy to [Music] when you feel ready to simply offer to any individuals or to the universe at large the loving-kindness that has cleared you here tonight and when you were ready come back to your breath and to the homey room that supports you [Music] take three full deep breaths in your own timing now surrendering any residual tension with a sigh as needed [Music] [Music] let your breath resume its natural rhythm after that third deep breath [Music] and within the image of this inner sanctuary envision yourself coming to curl up on the floor or a couch within this room envision yourself fully supported by cushions and blankets and then gently close your eyes on even this visualization as you come back to your body and to the reality that holds you know that the energies you cultivated in this sacred home are now embedded within you as you drift into sleep they were strengthened their roots so that you will soon embody their wisdom in each and every cell of your being allow your body to melt taking a brief moment to notice if there is any tension that might like to be released or any adjustments that need to be made and as you surrender into this space that hold you allow this Hawaiian prayer to continue clearing your inner world of that which no longer serves you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me [Music] thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry [Music] please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you I'm sorry please forgive me thank you I love you

1 [Music] hello this is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation designed to help you release what you've been holding on to and to help ease you into a deep and restorative night's sleep the intention behind this meditation is to help you to let go of that which you have been clinging on to surrendering it to a higher force through this process of letting go you're free up misplaced energy finding a greater sense of lightness freedom and pure state of being this mysterious and often misunderstood force to which your surrender may feel or sound like the word God or universal energy or consciousness or it may be by some other name that is comfortable and familiar to you you may even choose to leave it unnamed whatever the case this idea of a force simply points towards the energy that makes all of this life possible whatever term or non term becomes your guiding force for this meditation is entirely welcomed and accepted this energy will be the bed that nourishes you throughout the duration of this meditation and all the way into your sleep this recording is designed to be an anchor before bedtime for a consecutive 21 days over the course of these three weeks you will be repeatedly guided to let go of that which no longer serves you allowing the transformative powers of some higher force to nurture hold and awaken every level of your being before we begin I invite you now to ensure that all end of day activities are taken care of lights are switched off ringers are silenced and blinds are drawn make your way into a comfortable lying down position using any cushions and blankets required to support you through this transformative journey and then into a deep and restful sleep make any adjustments necessary allowing your body to begin the process of relaxation feeling yourself sink a little bit further into the surface that support you throughout this journey as is the case with any meditation you may experience rising emotions or other challenging sensations if these waves come to you know that is safe to feel into them allow the space that holds you the air that surrounds you and the force that lives within you to carry you through whatever arises just surrender these energies to the higher power that supports all of life note that each day of this meditation will be set against a different emotional backdrop know that from day to day this meditation will feel and look unique as you process it in your own natural way know that whatever arises is entirely okay and that whatever comes up is in fact required to be seen in order for you to move through it and finally know that you are unconditionally supported through this journey [Music] take a moment now to connect with your breath without attempting to change it in any way simply notice its natural rhythm in this very moment [Music] notice the way that without any action on your part the breaths innate wisdom guides itself into the body gently and back out to the world around you allow your breath to be your anchor into the present moment throughout this process of letting go for a few breaths now bring your awareness to your belly simply observe this part of the body and notice that wherever your attention flows the breath goes to witness the natural rise and fall of the stomach with each inhalation and each exhalation notice the body becoming more relaxed with each deep breath taken and feel that sinking further into this space that support you take a moment to bring awareness to the truth that just by being here in this very moment you are already beginning the process of releasing by allowing the body to rest deeply into this present moment you are immersed within the journey of releasing limited notions that have been carried for quite some time with your attention turn towards each breath you are continuously being grounded into the present moment surrendering your thoughts to that which exists all around you to cosmic energy to the source of all life throughout this meditation your mind may become subject to wondering if this is the case in any moment simply observe this tendency of the mind to lose its focus to wander into the past or into the future and into deeply entrenched beliefs about yourself or about life in general and know that this movement is entirely natural observe each mental shift away from the present moment with compassion and non judgment as humans with the capacity for self consciousness it is entirely natural for the mind to wander now if it's here and not to reject or deny these movements but to simply observe them and then to guide awareness back to the breath or some other anchor to the present moment [Music] with each mental meandering that arises simply witness it and then guide your attention back to your breath or to the sound of my voice take a few moments here to gently follow the breath allowing it to guide you further into this present moment releasing any mental notions of the past present or future simply allow yourself to be right here right now [Music] letting go requires a complete surrender of our mental energy often this process brings up uncomfortable sensations and deep feelings of fear whatever we have been holding on to has become interwoven with our experience and expectation of happiness letting go requires us to surrender into the deep and knowing that even without whatever beliefs ideas people or objects we have been clinging to we are entirely whole entirely loved and entirely free our attempts to control the world around us are born out of fear fear that we may not receive enough love or money or safety or nourishment or anything else for that matter through exerting control we often believe that we can ensure that our future will play out the way we hope for it to letting go of this belief requires a leap of faith a leap into knowing that everything we require will be provided by this cosmic force greater than us take a moment once again to tune in to the breath acknowledging any sensations feelings or emotions that may be rising simply witness these uprisings if they present themselves as passing waves that do not belong to you allow them to come and allow them to go without fixating on any mental ideas about what they are why they are there or what their purpose is simply observe them without thought without judgment and with unconditional acceptance and compassion the act of surrender requires what may feel like a courageous leap into the unknown and yet on the other side of this leap is the sensation of freedom by letting go of our attempts to control or to manipulate the world around us we release vast stores of energy this energy does not disappear from us but instead repurposes itself energy that was once tied up in fear becomes energy intertwined with love trust and peace take a moment now to come into the body due to the intricate interconnection of mind and body we can help to ease the mind and support its surrender through release and relaxation of the body just continue to follow my voice as we journey now through the body with each body part mentioned allow your attention to flow there allow each area to be infused with breath with warmth and with love allow each area to release any tension it may be carrying begin by drawing your awareness to your toes gently feeling into them softening them with your awareness [Music] regarde and release now both feet [Music] the ankles the lower legs softening your knees [Music] and your upper legs witnessin release any remaining tension within the entirety of both legs now draw your attention to and relax the buttocks pelvis your hips release now your belly softening let go [Music] you'll lower back and gently move up the spine to soften the entirety of the back allow the chest to soften and the heart to relax [Music] draw your awareness upwards along both arms beginning at the tips of your fingers slowly softening each part of the arm along your journey upwards when you arrive at the shoulders take a moment to witness and relax both shoulders and the entirety of both your arms soften now the Nick both front and back release any tension in the jaw the mouth your cheeks knows your ears and your eyes and the eye sockets soften the eyebrows and the phorid and then witness and relax the top of the head the back of your head relaxing and now your entire head gently softening letting go take a moment now to observe the whole body feeling it melt into the surface beneath it and as the body relaxes more deeply notice how the mind follows take a few deep breaths you allowing both body and mind to continue sinking into the universal energy that supports them as you continue your personal journey of letting go know that you are deeply supported by the higher force that exists around and within you this all-knowing and ever-present energetic force is a safe loving and supportive container capable of holding and transforming all mental beliefs stories and attachments this divine energy and its support can be called upon at any point to assist with your individual process take a moment now to bring your awareness to the heart space [Music] it may be helpful to slowly envision the mind descending melting into the non thinking space of your heart begin now to breathe from the heart allowing it to expand on each inhalation and soften on each exhalation [Music] through the heart we are better able to recognize our connection to this oneness that supports all of life by allowing your mind to descend and melt away we begin to operate from the hearts knowing from this deep faith and trust in the universe through the heart we operate from a knowing that there is no need to control the world around us and there is no need to latch on to anything we begin to feel into the safety and support that is always present and available to us as you slowly edge further towards sleep allow your breath to rock you into a deeply transformative state of relaxation where this surrendering process will continue each breath guides you back to the present moment each mindful breath is an act of surrender by releasing any mental beliefs we carry we allow ourselves to come further into the body into the breath and into the feeling of this present moment by releasing the stories of our past and the beliefs about our present and our future we break overly used energy patterns so that we may repurpose our energetic stores the use by our highest and most divinely connected selves feel into the freedom the love and the peace that presents itself by way of this sweet surrender I invite you now to gently introduce a few words to help reaffirm this process of letting go and to guide you into sleep through each breath cycle begin to repeat it is safe to let go it is safe to let go allow these words to gently guide you towards a deeply restorative slumber with each breath cycle feel yourself surrendering even a little deeper still it is safe to let go it is safe to let go allow these words to carry you for as long as necessary and soon you will find yourself easing peacefully into sleep the surrender will continue throughout the night while your whole body and mind rest peacefully gently releasing your attachments freeing your energy and filling your innermost being with freedom peace and lightness it is safe to let go it is safe to let go it is safe to let go it is safe to let go it is safe to let go it is safe to let go it is safe [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 hello and welcome to this short guided meditation that will help you to relax deeply as you release and transform any troubles you are experiencing with the help of the ocean's waves my name is jason stevenson and i invite you to open your heart and mind to this transformative practice let the top of your head stretch up towards the ceiling and your shoulders to soften towards the earth eyes closed and turn your attention inwards as you observe the gentle rhythm of your breathing and as you watch the breath flow into and out of your lungs notice how it resembles the steady flow of waves against a sandy beach in this moment your body is the shore and the breath is the ebb and flow of nature's mysterious force take a few moments to let the breath naturally guide you into a deeper state of relaxation just as the ocean's waves tend to lull us into a place of peace and tranquility soften your belly as you breathe and relax your shoulders seeing if the breath might like to move a bit deeper into your body you don't need to force anything simply observe the rhythm that is present and now i invite you to turn your attention towards the mind's eye to the seat of your capacity for inspired visualization and from within this space i invite you to imagine that you were standing firmly grounded on a warm tropical beach the ocean just a dozen meters ahead of you sparkles beneath the beaming sun soft waves crash gently against the steady shore forever flowing back out to the vastness from which they came the air is a comfortable temperature warming each cell bone and corner of your soul you look left and right realizing that no one is here but you this healing space is all yours to enjoy in peace and tranquility so take a moment to ground yourself by feeling the soles of your feet against the multitude of grains of sand beneath you the warmth from this surface permeates up through your legs your pelvis running up the length of your spine and then expanding outwards through your arms and up to the crown of your head you tilt your head gently as your face extends towards the sun and you begin to feel any weight you've been carrying melt from your body take a long deep breath in and out and slowly you make your way closer towards the water's edge you pause just a few meters away from it and settle yourself into the sand coming to a seated position feel into the sensation of the warm sandy surface embracing each inch of your skin that comes into contact with it as you sink into this unfolding moment you begin to surrender any barriers that exist within you to experience deep peace and relaxation you know that in this moment there is nothing you need to do nothing you need to accomplish and nothing you need to be you know that you are enough as you are and that this moment is enough as it is and as you watch the luminous waves crashing against the sandy shore just before you you offer up to these transformative waters any troubles you've been experiencing lately all limitation or challenging thoughts feelings emotions and stories leave your body with each breath out and as the energy of these thoughts and feelings flow through the breeze towards the ocean you watch as they are swept away for healing and transformation as each wave rushes back into the ocean abyss take some time consciously offer up anything you might like to release to these cleansing waters watch all of your troubles be washed gracefully away and when you were ready take a moment to come back to the simple beauty of this relaxing space to the sounds of the wondrous waves to the nourishment of each cleansing breath and to the warm glow of the soothing sun allow yourself to relax upon this serene beach for just a few more silent breaths slowly now let the imagery of this tranquil landscape dissolve as you take three deep and grounding breaths on your own rhythm and after that last long exhale let your breath return to its natural cycle and when you feel ready to come back to the world around you slowly open your eyes you might want to spend some time here just over the next five minutes listening to the sounds of the waves as you slowly come back let the relaxing energy of this beach move you through the day ahead or the evening tapping into your inner source of peace and release again and again you  English (auto-generated)

begin again continue to breathe in this way for a few more breath cycles on your own letting each inhalation and each exhalation be slow and full you may notice your belly rise and fall with each cycle while there are many things in life that you don't have control over your breath is one aspect that you can direct a bit become aware of your physical body notice any areas that may be holding on to tension unintentionally whatever part of you draws your focus most prominently allow your attention to linger here and welcome a softening into this part of your body perhaps you're noticing some tension releasing from the small muscles around your eyes or in the area of your neck and shoulders or maybe you are able to release your belly and back as you allow your attention to flow throughout your body easily and effortlessly in this moment you can surrender more completely to the supportive surface below you if there is lingering tension send warm loving thoughts and energy to this part of you in your mind's eye notice now the palms of your hands notice the energy here perhaps you feel this as warmth or tingling or a buzzing sensation notice how simply moving your awareness

up space in your mind give yourself permission to be right here right now doing just this sometimes it is helpful to invite the idea of offering yourself permission to let go of the past give yourself some space space for something new space to grow into like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow down in relationship to each breath as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts come back to noticing your breath when you find your mind wandering so that your mind can continue to clear the clutter of the

away from your body forever as you may still have thoughts going through your mind notice them from afar as if you are an observer allow the thoughts to pass by and return your attention to your breath and to the sound of my voice as your guide on this journey of relaxation and discovery now begin to deepen each breath in and out notice the stillness that comes between each inhale and exhale

are melting the tiny muscles around your eyes release and you can feel your eyelids becoming very heavy and your cheeks relax [Music] as you part your teeth unclench your jaw and relax your tongue the tension in your body dissolves away allow your throat and neck to soften and as you feel the muscles around your eyes let go and your jaw release notice the rest of your body knows what to do and we'll respond by letting go of any held tension this calming light sends a message to your mind and your body that you are safe and it is time to relax for a deep and tranquil night's sleep [Music] you can see and feel the warm glowing light moving downward continuing this progressive relaxation like a wave washing over you feel the tension melting out of your shoulders travelling down your arms as if flowing out of your body through your fingertips feel how each part of your body becomes heavy and connected to the Earth's energy as you allow it to let go [Music] this connection of energy will support you on your journey of self-discovery today with each breath you notice your chest and abdomen begin to feel heavy and you sense that you are fully supported by your surroundings and protected by this glowing calming light as it continues the relaxation process notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper this light continues to move down your body releasing the tension from your lower back and hips your thighs and pelvis feel very heavy and sink down into the surface below you [Music] your knees and lower legs soften as your body continues to rest heavy your ankles and feet let go of any remaining tension that your body may still feel to be completely relaxed safe and supported now take one more moment to scan your body for any residual tightness or tension [Music] and then breathe into that area so that you can completely let go and surrender to the heaviness of gravity and now your whole body is heavy and strongly connected to the surrounding light energy we are connected by energy in this world every living thing there are no gaps between us we are exchanging molecules with each other constantly [Music] just as the light surrounds and supports you the energy of the earth is connecting you with every living thing with the animals with the trees with the water we are one collective energy since this collective energy and allow it to relax you deeper [Music] now that you are deeply relaxed begin to use your imagination visualize yourself outside on a wooded trail take in your surroundings with all of your senses let the scene appear in your mind in whatever way you like perhaps you can see the gentle rays of sunshine coming through the branches of the trees maybe you can feel the Sun as it casts a subtle warmth on your skin let the temperature be perfect for you in the scene in your mind the air feels pure and smells fresh and clean notice how your feet feel as they make contact with the surface of the path below you look at your surroundings and take in all the sights of nature it is peaceful and quiet on this wooded trail you're in a space where you feel your body remain in its calm and relaxed state then you are feeling very safe here now in your mind begin to walk along the trail as you walk you notice there's a small lake on one side of the path in the distance and although the water is calm you can hear the noise the water makes as it moves with the gentle breeze you continue walking along the trail in the direction of the water slowly moving step by step remaining calm and relaxed when you get to the sloping bank of the water you look out to see the sparkling reflection of the trees and the Sun [Music] on the glassy surface of the water standing on

1 hello and welcome to this powerful guided meditation my name is Jason Stephenson thank you for joining me this mindfulness meditation and visualization will lead you with compassion and curiosity deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation and then into the past before eventually carrying you into a deep and peaceful sleep I invite you to open your heart to this journey to whatever reveals itself knowing that you are unconditionally supported in each and every moment that passes allow the mind to rest aside as we move backwards through time there is nothing you will need to actively search for and nothing you'll need to find images and inner sensations may come for you but you will not need to control them manipulate them or force them in any way simply allow yourself to open up entirely to whatever moves through you as we take this journey allow this meditation in each moment to naturally reveal itself as you move deeper and deeper into the past so before we begin take a moment or two to come into a comfortable lying down position ensure that you feel safe and secure wherever you are ensure that your neck is aligned with the spine and your shoulders are relaxed [Music] take a moment to consciously release all muscles as you sink further into this supportive surface beneath you take a few deep breaths here grounding yourself in this present moment use your breath to guide you towards a place of complete stillness [Music] although we will be moving through the expansive field of time you can always ground yourself back into the present moment if you feel uncomfortable at any point you are in complete control of this journey so if any images or sensations arise that are too challenging for you to present Lee look at simply use your breath to anchor yourself back into the present moment you are always always in control of your journey with that said if any challenging images arise or if the experience becomes heavy you are also in an entirely safe domain to explore them images that arise in our consciousness can never hurt us they are solely tools or teachers that hold the potential to guide us forward in powerful and positive ways know that you are universally supported in each and every moment now take a moment to come back to your body notice your sense of touch through the way the surfaces around you make contact with your physical body feel into the textures that are present without moving noting how they feel as they rest against your skin [Music] consider the deeper levels of the physical body is it possible to become mindful of the cellular world [Music] notice your muscles and then invite them to relax encouraging them to sink further into the surface beneath you now consider the presence of air around your body and then gently follow it as it moves within filling your lungs fully as you take a breath in and returning to the world around you on your exhale allow the breath to become slow and steady just like the subtle lapping of waves against the shoreline take a few breaths on your own here following the innate rhythm of this life force that supports you [Music] [Music] allow yourself to come into a state of relaxation by drawing your breath to the heart space as you inhale allow your heart to expand filling itself to the outer edges with peace joy and clarity and as you exhale allow the walls of the heart to soften releasing any tension that may be stored there [Music] continue to breathe this way for a few more rounds effortlessly quietening the mind as you move closer and closer towards the true state of your heart [Music] begin to notice a growing sense of peace and tranquility as you become more attuned with the ever unfolding present moment in just a few moments we will begin our regression into the past allow your imagination to enrich your visions as you move further and further into the mystical landscape we are about to enter [Music] for just a few moments allow the space before your third eye to empty completely you may still see various colors and swirls of energy passing before you there's no need to change or attempt to control this instead see if you can simply observe whatever is present there just in front of your closed eyes [Music] you don't have to judge it or attempt to change it in any way simply notice the space that quietly and safely hold you in complete stillness [Music] in just a moment your sink as far into relaxation as is required for your personal present moment and needs simply follow my voice as I count down guiding you deeper and deeper into a state of all-encompassing peace and tranquility 10 you are feeling safe and secure embraced by this open space 9 all stress and tension is being released with every breath you take [Music] eight you were feeling heavy nourished by the energy around you [Music] seven you are releasing even further six every muscle is relaxed five you are completely comfortable to let go for sinking further and further three the mind is quiet and as you have come to relax completely to you breathe slowly deeply and effortlessly and one you have arrived completely at peace completely relaxed [Music] all is quiet all is at peace now something starts to appear before your eyes out of the vast empty space before you you notice a mist developing it is airy and enchanted somehow beckoning you closer you take a few steps towards this mist very slowly and mindfully and as you approach it begins to dissipate as it slowly clears you begin to see there is a bridge ahead of you covered in moss and vines you make your way towards it mindfully treading on the pressed earth beneath your feet and as you cross over everything you ever knew begins to disappear all thought all attachments all fears and all worries you are entering into a new world into a different time [Music] with every step you take you inch closer towards the space and time just on the other side of the bridge it is a place that feels familiar somehow but one that your conscious mind cannot put any memory to the mist continues to clear and you realize you are within a dense majestic forest you feel at home you feel at peace here [Music] he reached the other side of the bridge and with the mist having vanished completely now you take a closer look at the scenery around you notice the colors and textures of this vibrant forest consider the way the earth feels beneath your feet [Music] you heighten your awareness of the aroma that awakens as you inhale deeply [Music] allow this place to nurture the deep sense of peace that is within you he walk forward ever so slightly as you noticed something peeking through from within the trees and as you approach you realize there is a cabin hidden within these woods and somehow you sense that it is or was your own you instantly remember it perhaps becoming flooded with visions of what it was once like in your own time you reach the front door and enter [Music] take a few moments to witness the visuals that are arising [Music] what does the cabin look like what happened here once upon a time [Music] who is with you imagery may come slowly and subtly simply allow them to arise in their own time allow your imagination and intuition to expand quite effortlessly mindfully consider what was once here that no longer remains [Music] remain open to whatever arises there is no need to fear the past it no longer has any control over you simply allow yourself to become the outside observer of whatever you feel has happened here watch this film play out as if you are a viewer rather than the character at center stage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] continue to breathe deeply as you simply observe whatever is present without judgment or condemnation [Music] [Music] as we move through this time we shed old ways of being in order to make room for more expansive ones mindfully begin to consider what messages or lessons are being shared through these images that are arising what is there to be learned what is there to shed allow the mind to remain quiet as your intuition arises tune in with your heart opening yourself to the possibility of transformation [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] return to your breath and to the aroma of the woods take a few more moments to witness whatever once happened at this beautiful cabin in the forest [Music] and slowly in your own time returned to the bridge slowly crossing back over as you return to the present physical reality you passed through the mist once more making your way to the other side 10 you are breathing deeply 9 you feel inspired and uplifted by what you have learned 8 you are calm and relaxed seven your breath flows as steady as gentle waves caressing the shore [Music] six the past fading now five you feel deeply connected to the physical world for you exhale deeply letting everything melt away three you feel gratitude for the present reality you are in two you know that you are whole and complete in this very moment one you have arrived you are home once again you are at peace [Music] with the past now behind you you feel deeply settled within this present moment you know that the past cannot be changed but that it provides opportunity for growth and expansion everything you witnessed now dissipates just as the mist did as you crossed over and into the past you are still and silent and for the moment nothing remains to be seen you continue to allow positive and empowering lessons to reach you as you transition into a sleeping state but you are not in search of anything you are ready to rest easy for the entire night ahead dozing off swiftly and soundly take a few more breaths mindfully inhaling peace contentment and freedom [Music] and exhaling everything whatever once was [Music] [Music] [Music] the only place that truly exists is this very moment everything that once was can be used as a tool for self-realization at some future moment but for now allow your breath to gently rock you to sleep allow yourself to be nourished throughout the night ahead repeat the following words to yourself in silence as you gently fall into a deep slumber I am at home I am supported I am at peace I am home I am supported I am at peace I am home I am supported I am NOT peace [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this guided sleep meditation that will help you to effortlessly wind down and to fall asleep quickly by consciously inviting relaxation into your body and mind and by using the power of visualization you will soon enter a deeply relaxed state that is conducive of a solid night's slumber my name is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to follow me on this journey as you slowly surrender to sleep I invite you now to begin drawing your attention to your physical body and making any adjustments necessary to facilitate relaxation use any cushions or blankets you need for warmth or support and also ensure that any distracting lights are turned off and that your blinds are drawn [Music] see if you can comfortably form one straight line from tailbone to neck and then let your limbs relax wherever they are comfortable close your eyes if you've not done so and take a few slow and steady breaths to settle in [Music] as we move through this meditation know that there is nothing you need to achieve or accomplish simply let these words flow effortlessly through you use them to ground your attention if the mind wanders away into less than settling thoughts now let us begin by practicing some deep belly breathing to help us shift further into the body's rest and digest state of being so begin by drawing your attention to the stomach perhaps placing a hand there if you like and after your next full exhalation take a deep breath in letting the belly expand as the air enters into you hold the breath at the top for just a second and then slowly let the air back out through the pursed lips just watching the belly fall when you reach the bottom hold the air out for just a second or two and then take another full deep breath in so continue to breathe in this way for just a few moments on your own letting each inhalation and each exhalation belong letting the belly rise and fall with each cycle and also allowing for a second pause at the end of each in-breath and each out breath [Music] continue breathing this way for a short while longer letting your attention ground in the sensation of breathing [Music] and after your next exhalation allow your breath to resume its natural depth pace and rhythm [Music] note what it feels like to be in your body now observing any shifts that you may have already experienced remember that during meditation when you are invited to note your experience there is nothing expected of you just simply allow your experience to be what it is in this moment trusting that everything is moving you towards a greater state of harmony [Music] and take a moment now to draw your attention to the physical body noting any areas of unconscious contraction it is not uncommon to hold tension in the brow in the shoulders in the belly or in your hips and so as you observe the fullness of your body in this moment see where you might be able to soften to surrender more completely to the earth beneath you [Music] if there is tension or discomfort that cannot be consciously relaxed I invite you to instead send that area a few loving words of support you might even silently ask what part of me is calling for attention here bless whatever aspect of mind or body comes to your awareness by sending it your kindness and care [Music] now in just a moment we'll begin a soothing visualization that will help you to wind down even further but before we do just take a moment to notice the surface that hold you notice the stillness of your body and the support of the physical world just open yourself up to the beauty of this simple quiet moment before we transition in the realm of inspired imagination [Music] now I invite you to begin visualizing that you are standing in a wide-open enchanted corridor with windows lining the wall to your right [Music] the high ceiling above you boasts a floral mural peach violet and gold flowers intertwined with vines decorate the space overhead the hallway feels majestic as if you are in an old palace that time has forgotten old pieces of artwork lined the walls and yet you know the space is well-kept as there are no signs of dust or debris it is well kept in your mind at the very least [Music] and off to your right through the expansive windows that line the corridor you peer out over crystal waters a sea extends as far as the eye can see the skies clear birds frolic in the sky and the waves are caressing the shore the Sun is slowly setting upon this peaceful land casting a dark pink light across the horizon yearning to smell the sea breeze you crack open a window and take a full deep nourishing breath in and you let it back out [Music] another deep salty breath in through the nostrils and then slowly release once again [Music] each breath of this fresh air cleanses you purifying body mind and soul [Music] you step away from the window now curious as to where this corridor might lead you the world outside is beautiful and inspiring you long for a deep and nourishing rest and so you decide to head out in search of a place to lay your head you turn away from the window now and slowly make your way down the corridor your feet tread lightly you are completely aware of each moment you make [Music] you carry on down the hallway pausing as you reach a closed door at the end above the doorway there is a sign that reads to the cave of peace something settles within you simply upon reading this sign and so you slowly reach out your hand to pull open the door just on the other side an enchanted spiral staircase presents itself undoubtedly leading you down towards the cave of peace below the number 10 is etched in gold on the stone wall of the staircase suggesting you are ten flights up from the earth below you take a moment to prepare for the descent admiring the smooth stone walls the marble staircase and the gold-plated hand railing that spirals effortlessly downwards you take a deep breath in and out and then you begin taking the twisting steps towards the ninth floor as you reach the landing of the ninth floor you feel a weight fall from your shoulders all the worries of the day have been released and you feel yourself breathing deeper easier than you did before you arrived here as your shoulders drop away from your ears your heart space opens you feel light and free after a full mindful breath you carry on towards the eighth floor gliding graciously down the marble steps [Music] when you arrive on this next landing you feel your jaw drop and your brow relaxed your head space begins to feel lighter as you open more fully to this journey of deep release taking a full deep breath in and out and then you carry on slowly down the staircase taking your time to reach the seventh floor landing [Music] when you arrive there you feel a wave of gratitude wash over you you feel grateful for the air that nourishes you for the space that holds you and for the beauty that lives within you silently thank the universe for all that you were blessed with after another mindful breath you carry on down the staircase pausing when you reach the sixth floor [Music] here on the sixth floor you take a moment to tune into your heart and are flooded with the sense of embodied self-love self-care and self compassion something within you awakens to your own divinity and in response you feel a deep sense of appreciation for who you are exactly as you are you take another moment to revel in this sense of self appreciation before continuing on down the marble staircase [Music] as you come to reach the fifth floor something within you whispers for you to let go perhaps it is a belief you've been holding on to that no longer serves you or a worry you've been carrying too heavily [Music] whatever within you might be ready to depart breathe it out with a deep exhalation before continuing down towards the fourth floor [Music] you'll and gracefully on the fourth floor landing and as you do you are overcome with a sense of deep trust in the universe you realize that every single step you've taken in this life has brought you to where you are now and where you are now here in this enchanted staircase is serving you in countless ways you trust that this is exactly where you were meant to be and after taking a mindful breath here you continue your descent [Music] soon you reach the third floor where something within you whispers this moment is enough this moment is enough [Music] you pause here grounding your two feet into the solid floor beneath you you peer out through a window that overlooks the sea just beyond these walls and your heart opens even wider to embrace the peace and simplicity of this moment yes you think to yourself this moment is enough continuing the descent you move your feet again allowing them to carry you gracefully to the landing below as you arrive on the second floor you pause yet again full presence comes to you now there is nothing you seek nothing you are grasping at and while yes some part of you longs to rest completely by dozing off into slumber there is no anxiety in you about it you know that you will arrive there very soon and that it will be this peaceful present energy that assists you in getting to that state with ears two more flights to go and so you continue your journey towards the first floor landing as you arrive on the main floor you feel completely and deeply grounded fully aware of your connection to the earth beneath and around you you know that you are well rooted in this life and in this moment you feel centered stable and supported a sign by the top step of the next set of stairs reads to the cave of peace and so you take a full deep breath once again then you make your way step by step to that final floor just beneath the earth and as you step off that final stair you find yourself in a wide-open room that is indeed cave-like and lit with candles it is the most elegant cave you have ever seen majestic in its outfit a splendid rug the color of mole breeze and the Tuscan Sun covers much of the floor off to the side a four-poster bed sits elegantly it is adorned with plush cushions and blankets that cause you towards it and yet before you go you take a moment to admire the quietude of this space the simplicity the elegance and the comfort the candle light soothes your soul as it flickers against the walls of the cave [Music] and now ready to rest your head you take a moment to gently blow out all of the candles in the room leaving the one next to your bed for last [Music] you make your final preparations for sleep and then you crawl into the cozy bed before you when you are settled you blow out the last remaining candle and sink into the darkness of this room your body rejoices at the comfort of this place you have found yourself in it feels well supported and fully nourished in this abode the space is quiet cozy and peaceful and so you prepare to let your entire body ease into a deep slumber there's settle more completely you come back to your breath held safely in this night you allow your belly to soften and the breath to flow as deep as it is comfortable to with each breath ian you feel a sense of universal love and support entering you and with each breath out you free yourself of any tension that no longer serves you [Music] your breath resumes its natural pace now as you draw your attention to the top of your head as you hold this space in your awareness you send it your love and invite it to relax as you exhale gently your attention shifts towards the space between your eyebrows and in the same way you witness love and ease this part of you through your presence and through your breath [Music] you continue in the same way nourishing your cheeks and your jaw your tongue and your mouth softening relaxing [Music] and your throat and shoulders dropping letting go [Music] [Music] next you trace the length of your left arm all the way to your fingertips inviting it to soften into the surface beneath you [Music] repeating the same on the opposite side you allow your right arm to be seen and to relax completely you trace it from the right shoulder all the way to your fingertips draw your attention now back to the heart space holding this loving center of your being in full awareness as you breathe into the heart watch it expand and as you exhale from the heart allowed to soften your attention slowly shifts down your spine relaxing each vertebrae and the surrounding muscles as you gently make your way towards your stomach and as you hold your belly in your awareness you offer it your love and invite it to rest for the night you hold your pelvis and your hips and your loving awareness next breathing into it and out of this space completely and then slowly you draw this loving awareness down the left-leg inviting it to relax in its entirety all the way down to your toes [Music] you then come back up to the right hip and slowly repeat this process of softening as you scan the length of your right leg all the way down to your toes [Music] now hold your entire body in your awareness letting each inhalation move all the way into the farthest reaches of your being and each exhalation to soften the entire body [Music] [Music] the body is relaxed the mind is relaxed and now nothing stands between you and a deep peaceful sleep [Music] the envisioned room in your mind's eye dissolves as you realize you are once again in the room that holds you physically and though you are no longer in the cave of peace that once held you it has bestowed its energy upon each one of yourselves it's peaceful presence remains with you [Music] continue to mind your breath gently now as you slowly allow yourself to sink into a deep and peaceful night's sleep rest well my friend rest well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

1 hello and welcome to this guided meditation and visualization that will help you to cleanse negative energy from both mind and body before leading you into a restorative night's sleep my name is Jason Stevenson and I invite you to set the world you know aside as you open your heart and mind to the possibility of awakening new inspired energy to begin take a moment to find a comfortable lying down position and using whatever blankets and pillows you need for support and then closing your eyes when you're ready soften your brow [Music] your jaw and your limbs just allowing your entire body to soften into the surface beneath you before we dive deeper into this visualization let's take a moment to mindfully tune into the present moment beginning with the breath noticing the path that your breath takes as it moves through you beginning as it enters your nostrils moves through your windpipe and fills your lungs and then notice the same path but in Reverse watching how the chest and belly soften as you exhale [Music] observe that gentle subtle movement of the body as you breathe becoming more aware of the aliveness of your being and now as the breath enters I invite you to draw your attention towards the stomach welcoming the breath to flow all the way into it and as you exhale let the belly soften completely just take a few more deep belly breaths on your own now perhaps releasing a softer sigh with your next view exhalations and now I invite you to let the breath expand even further by imagining each inhalation reaching into the furthest corners of your body into your toes your fingertips and your crown and when you come to exhale imagine the breath taking with it any and all tension lingering anywhere within the body you breathe into the fullness of your being and then invite your entire body to release as you exhale take just a few more full-body breaths on your own when you were ready to let go of even this breathing technique let your breath resume its natural pace depth and rhythm in a few moments we will begin a visualization that will help you to cleanse any negative energy you may be holding and as we move through this practice I invite you to remain compassionate and patient towards yourself softening any judgement if it arises I encourage this because it is not uncommon that we feel shame guilt or judgment when we consider that we have been harnessing negative thoughts feelings or other energies and yet all of these things are a part of the human experience they offer us opportunities to learn evolve and awaken regardless of where this negative energy may have come from I invite you to release any stories you might hold about wrongdoing and by softening shame and guilt and through opening up to ourselves with compassion and patience we lovingly create space to release what no longer serves us and to invite in the energy that will so take a moment now to draw your attention to the crown of your head gently softening any tension you might observe here or in the space of the third eye relax your shoulders your arms release your belly and any other unnecessary tension and then come back to your breath as we prepare to cleanse our energy field through the power of this visualization calling upon your innate capacity for imagination now I invite you to envision that you are on a small chartered boat sailing calmly and gently towards the shore of a pristine tropical island you sit or stand at the prow breathing in the fresh salty breeze of the open sea around you you have charted this small boat for an island getaway for a chance to rest reset and cleanse yourself of any negative energy you've been exposed to or have been holding on to and as the boat nears the dock at the shore you feel your shoulders releasing some of the unnecessary weight they've been carrying no breathing deepens and finally the boat pulls up against the dock overhanging the turquoise waters you carefully step on to the steady dock turning to thank the captain and to let him know that you will be back later in the day then you head on your way your backpack is full of all you need for the day and so pulling the straps tight now you begin your journey through the pathway that leads through the tropical jungle oasis palm trees and other lush greenery line the narrow trail you find yourself on birds ring out in the trees overhead as do chirping insects and croaking amphibians the air is completely free of any man-made sounds you relish in this in the purity of the symphony that fills your ears already you can feel your lungs being cleansed your breath moving deeper and your body being filled with pristine air full of vitality you continued on a little while longer weaving through the jungle of this private island [Music] eventually you come across a shimmering Azure Blue Lagoon just off to your right you take a moment's pause here kneeling down by the water's edge something about this Lagoon feels enchanted something tells you that the water is listening that it is aware of your presence so you take this as an invitation to consciously set the intention to release any negative energy that has been harbored within you take a moment to formulate this intention in your own words and when you were ready you whisper this intention to the pristine mystic waters before you you sense that simply through having set this intention something has been released and that the process of deep cleansing and rejuvenation has been upgraded so you take a few final moments to absorb the beauty of this Lagoon and then you continue along the path that has gotten ooh this far continuing to make your way through the lush environment you've retreated to you feel a deep sense of gratitude for this opportunity to clear your energy field [Music] not only do you thank the environment that is supporting you now but you also feel a sense of appreciation for the part of you that made this retreat a priority you thank yourself for this act of self-care you carry on until soon the path widens slowly transitioning from soil to sand and as you make your way through the last layers of trees on this opposite side of the island your jaw drops at the purity of the white sand beach before you and at the calm turquoise waters that ripple out from the island you've arrived at a place where you can allow all remaining negativity to be cleared from your being you are certain that this is the place for it and so you take off your shoes carrying them in one hand as you walk closer towards the water you walk slowly allowing your feet to sink into the warm sand with each step a few meters from where the soft wave slap against the shore you drop your bag and your shoes letting your feet ground into the sand rooting yourself through your feet you then stretch your arms up towards the sky your heart opens as your chest pushes forward welcoming the radiance of the Sun the sky and sea you let your arms come to rest by your sides now as you gaze out over the open waters with not a single other landmass inside you feel as if you're a world away from the everyday you take a deep breath in and letting it go with a sigh and then you lay out your towel and prepare to head into the calm and cleansing waters you remember the intention you had said to cleanse yourself of any negative energies perhaps negative thoughts feelings habits or more subtle energies that no longer serve you and as you begin walking towards the water you invite these negative energies to come to the forefront of your mind and you hold them here not to judge criticize or condemn them but to silently let them know that you can see them and to let them know that it is time for them to be let go [Music] slowly wading into the water you let the cool sea brush against your skin beginning to cleanse you from the outside continuing on until you are waist-deep you pause and then you bring your palms together in front of your body inviting all negative energies to be held between them raising your arms up and overhead you let these negative energies begin moving away from your body and you throw them forward sending them off into the sea as your hands dip underwater all the negative energies you once held begin to dissolve in the salty water that surrounds you you let the water to continue to cleanse you of all negative energies that you do not wish to hold on to you can even watch all the negative attachments float away from you [Music] all negative beliefs and stories all self-limiting beliefs and any of the negative energies you've picked up from the world around you all of it is now dissolving in the ocean feel free to roll on your back floating here safely for some time as the sunshine beams down on you [Music] slowly the subtle waves carry you back towards the shoreline and as you get closer you rise to your feet and slowly make your way back onto the beach resting your back on your towel you lie down here and let the Sun and the Seabreeze continue to cleanse you you notice there is far more room to breathe now to breathe in light love and positivity the negative energies you once held now feel so distant and all you are left with is room to grow new ideas new beliefs and new dreams and to conjure up new energies you feel immensely blessed for this transformation and as the Sun beams down on you you sense it awakening each and every cell in your body it awakens the cells in your toes your feet your lower legs your knees and your thighs it reinvigorates the cells in your hips your pelvis and your root chakra [Music] it brings new life to your belly your lower back your chest and your heart and your upper back and in the same way it awakens all the cells in your arms from your fingertips right up to your shoulders the cells and energy center in your throat awakens to as do all the cells in your face finally the top of your head the crown area opens up to the sunlight completely becoming a portal for positive energy to flow through your entire body you are fully alive here fully awake and positively inspired you come back to your breath letting each inhalation spread throughout your entire body and each exhalation to soften you you melt into the sand a little bit further with each breath knowing there is nothing you need to hold on to here a great wave of compassion washes through you as you bless yourself but the places you've been and the courage of harnessed to arrive here letting go and allowing for cleansing to happen is not always easy and so you feel immense appreciation to yourself for opening up in this way [Music] you also feel a growing compassion for all those who've crossed your path for those who have been weighed down by their own negative energy - you see the goodness and light at the core of everything you spend just a few more moments here on the sand beneath the Sun and then you slowly rise to your feet and prepare to head back to the boat that awaits you you take one last look at the beach and see that so graciously held you offering them your thanks and you turn towards the path that brought you here slowly venturing back into the tropical abyss as you walk you feel a lightness in your steps and in your entire body you move with ease and grace all parts of you are now deeply cleansed soon you make your way back to the lagoon where you had powerfully set your intention you pause at its edge letting an inner smile spread through you all of a sudden the tropical Symphony begins to grow louder the birds chirp with glee from their perches the frogs croak with contentment and the insects sing in their own way it sounds to you as though the jungle is applauding rejoicing in this return to your natural state of being you continue on your way leaving the lagoon behind positive energy continues to spread through you eventually you arrive back at the outer limits of the jungle noting the dock and the boat that awaits you slowly you make your way over towards it thanking the captain for his time you climb back in taking a comfortable seat on the boat and as it slowly pulls away from the dock and the island you look back in love and admiration of your experience here you consider how unconditionally you were held by the sand and by the sea feeling in complete alignment with the world you thank the sea for cleansing you of the energies you no longer needed and you imagine these energies slowly sinking to the ocean floor where they will be transformed into their raw pure elements [Music] as the boat continues towards the nearest mainland you let your back come to rest on its surface it's smooth and steady journey across the water lulls you towards slumber a state that will continue to process all of the transformation you experienced here you take one more deep breath in of the sea breeze and as you exhale you gently release the imagery of this beautiful cleansing landscape grounding yourself back into the surface that supports you in this reality carrying the experience of being cleansed into the awakened life notice the natural ebb and flow of your breathing using it to anchor you anytime the mind wanders in these next few moments before sleep and as you slowly drift off let the following affirmations flow through you to reaffirm the cleansing that has taken place as these words float through your subconscious mind they will help to embed this new reality into your daily life I let go of what no longer serves me I am an embodiment of love and truth

1 hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided meditation to help you release all muscular tension and to help you fall into a deep and peaceful sleep of this meditation you will be guided to bring your awareness to each area of the body to feel into it to tighten it and then to release it completely allowing the entire body to come to a state of total relaxation so before we begin this journey just ensure that all end of day matters are taken care of if you require an alarm to be set just quietly set it now if there are blinds that need to be drawn or bright lights that can be turned off just take care of these small matters before settling into a comfortable lying down position [Music] wherever you are and sure that the spine and neck are straight but relaxed and that you are supported in any way that you need take your time to adjust any cushions or blankets so the gyrus comfortable as possible in this very moment [Music] set an intention now to fully let go through both body and mind as we enter a process of complete release now let's begin by becoming more mindful of this exact moment in time and space begin by drawing your awareness to your ears and to all the sounds that you may currently be infiltrating through them you open your hearing simply observe all the sounds that come from subtle hums to more prominent noises outside you without judging or labeling these sounds practice remaining in a state of deep awareness as vibrations filter into your eardrums and as they disappear allow the Mayans tendencies to categorize to label and the judge to step aside as you simply witness these noises as dynamic expressions of life as simple and subtle vibrations of energy now expand your awareness of this present moment by beginning to observe the physical space you rest in notice the air that touches your skin and the material world that supports and surrounds you [Music] take a few moments to observe each inch of your body that is in contact with the physical world [Music] you might come to notice the temperature of your body and surfaces around you you might observe the textures of blankets and pillows that brush against your skin [Music] and you might even observe a barely describable feeling of support of safety or of heaviness as you sink further into the surface beneath you [Music] [Music] notice if the body's formation or sensory experience changes in any way as you become more mindful of this physical space you are in [Music] become more mindful now of your breath quietly observing the rhythm and depth of its present form [Music] [Music] to be mindful does not mean to change or to manipulate the present moment in any way that the mind deemed to make better or worthy to the contrary mindful awareness asks us to open to and to accept this moment exactly as it is so with this in mind see if you can open to your breath exactly as it is right now releasing any judgment or expectation for it to feel any differently than it presently does [Music] if a natural deepening occurs allow this simply noticing it as a natural movement of energy further into your being [Music] continue to observe the breath for a few more moments feeling into the expression of each inhalation and each exhalation notice the feeling of air entering through your nasal cavity filling your lungs and pressing upward against your belly [Music] and then notice the same dynamic movement in Reverse observing any sensations connected to your fall exhalation [Music] just breathe here in mindful awareness for a few more silent moments [Music] if the mind wanders at any point during this meditation see if you can refrain from judgment as you compassionately call your attention back to the present moment it is in the minds nature to wander but with that said we can use the power of our intention to refocus our attention back on this present moment this refocusing is what helps us to enter an expanding state of complete of relaxation in just a few moments we will enter into a full-body scan through which you will become deeply aware of the presence of tightness in the body and then of the feeling of complete relaxation you will be guided to witness tighten and release each area that we pass allowing each part of the body to come to deep rest and complete ease in preparation for a peaceful night's sleep [Music] as much as possible see if you can align tightening movements with your inhalations and all movements towards release with your exhalations just breathe naturally in between each muscle group that we work on [Music] so before we begin into this body scan I invite you to make any adjustments now that will help you to feel into the entirety of your body you might find that it is easiest to access each muscle when in a straight line down position on your back however if this is not comfortable for you come into a position that is as neutral as possible while remaining comfortable ensure that the chest is open with shoulders drawing away from the ears allow your breath to continue to be in the background of your awareness secondary only to your gently shifting awareness of the physical body so begin by noticing your toes feeling into them exactly as they are in this moment notice if there are any sensations present any tiredness or softness [Music] and now consciously tighten just your toes on your next inhalation observing what it feels like for them to be pulled inwards completely and then exhale letting them go and allowing all tension melting away with ease [Music] now bring your awareness towards both feet toes and ankles included observing them exactly as they are in this moment on the next breath in tensor muscles in the feet area holding tightly for just a brief moment and then release all of the tension on your exhalation allowing your feet toes and ankles to rest back down completely and breathing normally for a few moments [Music] observe now the presence of both of your lakes drawing your awareness all the way from your heels up to your hips noting any sensations you pass along the way hold the entirety of both legs in your awareness and then inhale as you tighten these muscles squeezing them in towards your midline hold there for a moment and then exhale releasing them completely into the surface beneath you [Music] moving to the area between the hips draw your awareness to your pelvis on your next breath in tighten all of these muscles holding them for just a brief moment and then release them completely on your next breath out just feel into this complete release from your pelvis downward letting each of these areas sink further into the support of the physical world [Music] observe the stomach region now becoming aware of its present state and then as you inhale tighten all of these core muscles holding them in tightly for just a moment as you hold the breath in and then release entirely as you exhale softening all muscles around the belly return to your natural breathing rhythm as you relax the stomach completely [Music] now expand your awareness of the stomach to encompass the entire tosser from lower back to upper and from belly up to the shoulders take a moment now to observe each muscle group in the core of your body [Music] now on your next inhalation tighten them or towards the midline of your body feeling them in a contracted state and then release heavily with a sigh allowing your entire torso to relax completely [Music] take a moment here to reconnect with your breath mindfully observing its present form [Music] bring your awareness now to your hands fingers included observe the way they are resting in this moment noticing if they are relaxed or tense or somewhere in between [Music] as you inhale allow all of these muscles in the hands and fingers to tighten coming into a compressed fist hold for a brief second or two and then exhale as you release allowing both hands to rest completely relaxed [Music] draw your awareness now from your wrists all the way up to your shoulders and compasses all the muscles and areas in between so inhale as you contract all of these muscles perhaps pulling them up towards your ears and then soften releasing all of these muscles in the limbs back down shoulders falling back down gently as well notice how different it feels in both body and mind between your contracted States and your softened ones now begin to observe all of the intricate muscles in your face noticing if there are any sensations present here consider the muscles in your jaw your cheeks your eyebrows and your forward [Music] now inhale as you contract all of these muscles squeezing your entire face together hold for just a moment observing the sensation and then exhale as you release all of these muscles completely let go of each muscle allowing all tension to drain away [Music] take a moment to come back to your breath for just a moment observing the entire body right where it is and right as it is [Music] observe this neutral state just for a moment and then on your next inhalation contract every muscle group accessible to your awareness squeezing the entirety of your body towards your midline hold everything together with the breath held in and then release completely letting a deep sigh escape from your lungs as all remaining tension and stress falls away allow each muscle to melt into the surface beneath you allow your breath to return to its normal rhythm as you sing further and further into the experience of this complete relaxation [Music] continue to breathe naturally mindfully observing the flow of air into and out of your being [Music] in this state of deep relaxation and release there is absolutely nothing to do but be entirely present with every muscle group relaxed completely you are moments away from drifting into a peaceful sleep that is in alignment with your present state of tranquillity allow your breath to become like waves your body is soft and gentle as the water beneath the service as you breathe notice yourself being rocked gently into an even deeper state of tranquillity the mind follows the body's lead quietening softening as you come into harmony with everything within and around you with every inch of your being having been consciously relaxed allow yourself to float effortlessly into a deep slumber allow your breath and the sounds to soothe your entire being as you slowly but surely descend completely into restorative and peaceful night's sleep and allow these affirmations to sink into your subconscious mind even if you do fall asleep trust that these affirmations will assist you as you drift deeper deeper into sleep I am relaxing deeper and deeper my mind is slowing down all tension is melting away [Music] I let go of all my worries [Music] my body is relaxed and that peace [Music] my mind is calm I am centered and quiet [Music] my muscles are soft and relaxed [Music] I

1 i'm sarah raymond from the mindful movement tonight i will guide you into relaxation so you are ready to enjoy deep healing sleep all through the night take a moment to create a tranquil and safe environment for sleep to easily come to you when you are ready i invite you to make yourself comfortable for the start of this practice lie down on your back if you are able feel free to place a pillow under your knees to keep your back comfortable [Music] very gently tilt your chin downward and as you do this sense the back of your neck subtly lengthening allow yourself to begin to relax now with your eyes open keep your head still and move your eyes only as far as you can to your right [Music] although it may be dark continue to keep your eyes to your right as you breathe in and out deeply it may feel right to allow a sigh exhale [Music] take two more breaths allowing yourself to let go into relaxation after taking three breaths bring your eyes back to center and blink a few times and now still with your eyes open keep your head still and move your eyes only as far to your left as you can just like you did on the other side continue to keep your eyes to your left as you breathe in and out deeply again sigh it out if you like [Music] take a total of three breaths here [Music] allowing yourself to think deeper and deeper into a relaxed awareness of yourself bring your eyes back to center and again blink a few times [Music] one more position now with your eyes open roll your eyes up as if you were trying to look into your own eyebrows continue to look up as you take a deep breath in and out again breathe in [Music] and out letting go letting go letting go on your next breath out this time give in to the heaviness of your eyelids and allow your eyes to gently close down as your eyelids close you may sense the muscles in and around your eyes become heavy and relaxed this is a sign to the rest of your body to let go of tension and to move towards sleep now just forget all about your eyes [Music] and bring your awareness to your hands notice the energy and any sensations here with your next inhale make fists clench your hands strongly then as you exhale release your grip in your hands and throughout your entire body do this one more time clench your fists tightly as you breathe in and let go completely as you breathe out allow yourself to release the gripping not only in your hands but also throughout your whole being continue to make yourself comfortable adjust your posture for maximum comfort if needed knowing you are safe and fully supported as you continue to allow a relaxed state to wash over your entire body become aware of your natural breath notice the aspect of your breath that draws your attention first as you become aware here count your breath in without making any changes simply allow it to be what it is notice the count of your breath out just as it is [Music] accept your natural breath count and support it with your awareness anytime your mind wanders throughout this practice come back to your breath to refocus if the count changes allow this accept this invite ease into your breath your body and your mind like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow with every breath allow yourself the opportunity to relax into stillness at your own pace there is no rush as you begin to make space for your practice there is no right or wrong as you allow yourself time to settle your body into stillness know you are in the right place invite sleep to easily come to you let go of any resistance or worry to experience deep blissfully tranquil sleep as you allow the counting of your breath to drift away move your awareness to the sensations on the surface layer of your body [Music] perhaps notice where fabric touches your skin or the air brushes against you [Music] maybe you notice where one part of your body rests against another what are the sensations do you sense a specific temperature it is not about what you find when you look the benefits of this practice of awareness are offered because you are pausing and looking within fully experience these sensations even if you are only noticing one small space as you continue to notice the surface feelings encourage a sense of softening or ease to spread through your body [Music] begin to notice the sensations inside your body now as you quiet your thoughts you begin to hear the sensations when you slow down and stay with the sensations you notice more [Music] you may even learn something new about yourself [Music] take interest in yourself as you are with curiosity if you are able to allow life just as it is it can lessen suffering as you notice the sensations inside your body do you feel a buzzing or tingling energy do you sense the heaviness of your bones sinking into the surface supporting you once you are aware of your reality you may ask yourself what would it feel like for you to invite ease to move from the surface of your body to deep within [Music] listen with intrigue whatever arises during meditation is your teacher it is your reminder to be present and practice acceptance you can either encounter resistance or experience bliss by letting go and accepting your present state you are moving towards bliss look for what wants to be seen [Music] listen to what wants to be heard open to your experience of life with acceptance you may ask yourself what must i accept or release resistance to in order to experience a calm mind allow the answer to come without forcing it let the resistance dissolve away through acceptance scan through the sensations of your body with a relaxed awareness free of judgment surrender any tension you may notice soften any area you may experience gripping allow this surrender to happen naturally throughout your body by simply offering your awareness soften from the surface all the way to deep within you release any guarding you may be holding on to surrender to anything you are holding on to for fear of losing let go of what could have been let go of any worry let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders let any tension dissolve from your muscles every day we get a new chance to be in this moment surrender to the ability of your body to heal all emotional healing starts with self-love and forgiveness and emotional healing gives way to physical healing what else can you release or let go of to invite the healing process is it resentment shame or blame is it guilt or disappointment towards yourself whatever you are holding on to let it go love your body love your emotions love your thoughts love yourself express compassion and healing towards yourself can you find any areas where you are holding on and then let go perhaps you may be holding at the area of your stomach can you let go here continue to connect with relaxation as deeply as you can practice surrender practice letting go open to the healing energy within [Music] are you able to relax even more connect even deeper to yourself listen to your heart surrender to your inner wisdom your healing intuition [Music] let go of your body further and further into relaxation now as you continue to relax and allow a deep healing sleep to come to you whenever you are ready [Music] let your imagination conjure your personal healing place this is a sanctuary in your mind where you can safely experience profound

need healing being here in your healing place is an opportunity for you to connect with the deepest part of you where the wisdom of your body knows exactly what you need to heal yourself perhaps if it feels right you may also imagine there is a healing being here in your sanctuary with you someone who loves you and would help you heal or a professional healer or even a healing energy that would

1 ease into deep sleep quickly with the soothing guided meditation unwind after a long busy day disconnect from worry and let your mental activity naturally begin to slow and practice acceptance to let go of resistance while you sleep when you expect your reality to be something other than what it actually is you add unnecessary suffering to your experience when you can release your resistance and accept what is you can experience peace what you're thinking about right before you fall asleep will set the tone for not only the quality of your sleep but also your mindset for the next day you have the choice to change the way you look at things hello and welcome I'm massara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are an oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and the ability for self-healing let's settle in for this evening meditation and relaxation practice I invite you to make yourself comfortable create a safe and tranquil environment for yourself making sure you are all set to drift off into sleep if you wish it is important for you to have the sense of safety so you can fully relax make sure your room is dark and if possible turn off all screens and electronics if you are listening to this on an electronic device perhaps turn the screens light away from you create the most comfortable environment that you can feel free to pause this recording as you get yourself set up if you need [Music] as you are settling in lie down under your covers stretch your legs and take three deep breaths [Music] if your mind is wandering it's no big deal that is typical as the momentum of the day gradually slows simply become aware of your thoughts just as they are with acceptance notice these thoughts arising and passing by notice with curiosity and permission rather than the need for change the mind will not stop thinking completely so you can choose to notice accept and allow these thoughts to pass by [Music] as you acknowledge and allow your thoughts to pass you can begin to slip deeply into relaxation [Music] become aware of your breath just as it is notice with curiosity all there is to notice about your natural graph without the need to have it be something that it is not already [Music] since your breath without the need to change it in any way [Music] our breath is always there for us in the background an automatic action let the inhale and exhale guide you into a calm deeply relaxed State become aware of your inner physical experience just as it is notice how you are showing up to this practice not needing to be something else [Music] not needing to be somewhere different than exactly where you are take note of exactly where you are on your journey with acceptance [Music] you can give yourself permission to simply be peace is available when we stop resisting any given moment notice your body sensations just as they are notice any body pain with acceptance notice anybody pleasure with acceptance notice any neutral areas with acceptance settle into your body except being in your body right now just as you are take this time to be with yourself move closer to yourself accepting all that you are there is no need to make a change during meditation be just as you are accepting allows us to fully experience what is happening in the present moment to fully engage in life [Music] know that without suffering we cannot know joy without darkness we cannot know light allowing life as it is can lessen any struggle and perhaps additional unnecessary suffering when you feel life brings you challenges you can't accept you have the opportunity to be transformed by acceptance you may add suffering when you resist the way things are because they aren't the way you expect or want them to be you have the choice to let the resistance dissolve when you accept the way things are naturally there is a possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true [Music] peace is available when you stop resisting any given moment become aware of your whole body in your environment [Music] notice where your body makes contact with the surface beneath you and feel yourself being grounded since the weight of your body making a strong anchoring connection [Music] let go into gravity to feel heavy into your support notice the fabric of your clothes on your skin or the areas of exposed skin feeling the touch of the air simply be aware of your experience in this moment [Music] scan your body for any areas of tension except your experience as it is and then use your attention to welcome a softening a sense of ease to move throughout your body [Music] as you observe your body soften and release any areas you are able invite in the feeling of peace as you begin to tune out the whole world around you and go within with my voice as a soothing guide to help you sleep in a moment I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting from the top of your head going all the way through your body down to your feet as I say each part of your body you can see that part in your mind's eye notice what is true with acceptance so that you can invite relaxation to that body part welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind encourage the weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface below you so that there is no need to hold on you can simply let go into sleep now as you begin to scan your body bring your attention to the top of your head begin to notice the sensations here [Music] and then relax the top of your head and your scalp [Music] welcome this ease into your forehead and eyes relax any facial expression release the tiny muscles around your eyes and feel your eyelids becoming heavy allow your cheeks to soften unclench your jaw and allow your teeth to part become aware of the area of your neck and throat and with acceptance of your present moment experience completely relaxed as you accept yourself just as you are you allow each muscle to relax in progression and this invites a deeper sense of relaxation to the parts of your body that came before it in your body scan continue to notice except and relax as you invite a sense of peace and stillness to your shoulders chest and arms perhaps feeling a comfortable heaviness move into your ribs abdomen and back [Music] let go of any gripping in your hips and allow your thighs to rest heavy on the surface below you as if there is no difference between where you end and where the surface begins you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part allows it to relax and let go since now your ankles and feet releasing and relaxing completely take another moment to slowly scan your body once more [Music] this time notice any areas that may still be holding on to any lingering tension and after acknowledging and accepting your present experience ask your body to let go simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of the surface below you your body is safe and supported and knows what to do to relax if you simply allow the tension to release [Music] in addition to the added suffering that occurs when you resist the way things are you may also experience suffering when you are not accepting of yourself self-acceptance means accepting yourself exactly as you are without any wishes of how you should be there is a possibility for change only after the reality has been accepted and believed to be true the practice of self-acceptance is a step toward freedom and happiness in your life self-acceptance is knowing deep down in your heart that you are enough as you are it means being comfortable with your body your emotions and your mind it means accepting what you have achieved as well as what you have not yet accomplished acceptance of all your strengths as well as what you may consider your flaws it means being exactly who you are and not who you want others to see you as accepting yourself is not about praising yourself or receiving praise from others it means that you have a sense from within that you feel loved simply because you are being yourself [Music] when you love and accept yourself you are authentic and can trust yourself the first step on the path of self-acceptance is increased awareness as you build this awareness of yourself invite any feelings you may be having to show up fully welcome both positive and negative and honor what they are without judging or trying to change accept any positive emotions and know that you deserve to feel good [Music] and when negative emotions come to the surface treat yourself as you would a loved one with kindness and compassion [Music] know that these emotions are just that emotions they are not you they do not make you the person that you are [Music] notice your emotions as they show up for you now [Music] since the physical feelings of your emotions and where in your body you may be experiencing them notice with curiosity and acceptance experience your emotions just as they are let go of what you may think your thoughts or your emotions should be without changing anything simply meet yourself exactly where you are in the present moment and be aware of yourself the second step towards self-acceptance is loving-kindness and compassion for yourself in order to fully love and accept yourself you must let go of limiting beliefs and self-defeating behaviors let go of anything that no longer serves you on your journey to self-acceptance take a moment to let go of all the behaviors and beliefs that no longer serve you or are working against you [Music] there is no need to name these specifically right now simply let the negative energy go and replace it with positive energy make space for acceptance [Music] let go of judgments of ourselves and comparisons to others let go of unmet and unrealistic expectations let go of the need for perfection to be human is to be imperfect let go of comparisons with past versions of yourself let go of negative self-talk let go of shame and let go of guilt let it all go see all of this melting off of your body to be gone from your life forever without going into story or naming specific events let go of blame of ourselves and others let the heavy feeling float off your shoulders let go of blame of our circumstances let the sensation dissolve from your muscles [Music] let go of judgment of good and bad when we practice meditation we can choose to befriend our circumstances with compassion in a moment I will guide your subconscious with some positive affirmation statements of acceptance of reality as well as acceptance of self [Music] there is no need to repeat these if you are so relaxed you are almost sleeping your subconscious will hear them simply believe they are true continue to relax fully and know that at the core of your being these statements are true allow yourself to drift off to sleep with the sound of my voice if you wish through acceptance comes freedom and peace I allow my thoughts to be what they are I have the strength to accept what I perceive to be a challenge or an obstacle I trust that challenges will make me stronger I allow life to be exactly what it is I am loving and accepting of others I accept others as they are without trying to change them I accept the decisions of others and realize that it is their right to make their own choices I accept everyone I meet as they are I [Music] see the world through eyes of love and acceptance [Music] I accept the world the way it is [Music] I accept that all things are possible with intent and belief [Music] I choose love over fear [Music] day by day I am learning to trust the flow of life I accept all things as they are and this enables me to make a change [Music] I accept and appreciate the reality I have created for myself I accept and release everything in my life that is beyond my power to change I choose to experience this moment just as it is I accept people as they are with all their faults and failings today I willingly release the need to control the world around me I accept myself and my loved ones

1 you [Music] hello this is Sara Raymond and welcome to this meditation to help you increase your confidence and inner strength to prepare you for the day ahead today I will guide you into complete body and mind relaxation that can lead you into a deep sleep if you would like or if you are not ready to sleep you will be deeply relaxed before we get started make sure you are prepared to drift off to sleep when this recording is over if you would like take a moment now to turn off all distractions you can pause this recording if you like if there's anything you need to do to prepare yourself for safe and comfortable night's sleep know that you are safe and supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you choose to do so make yourself as comfortable as you can close your eyes and settle in for a deep productive night's sleep so you'll wake in the morning feeling rejuvenated and confident to start your day somewhere deep inside us all we know there is someone trying to grow to the surface our true self our higher self when we delve into self exploration we can see this person we know what direction we want to go for some of us the missing link is just the confidence to believe in ourselves enough to take action the confidence to live our life in alignment with what is truly important to us the last moments before sleep are so important to us they have a tremendous impact on how we start our next day when we wake up our thoughts pick up where they left off we can use this as an opportunity to give us the best chance to begin our day with a positive attitude and in alignment with our values and intentions this meditation is designed to help you drift off to sleep knowing you are going to have a great day [Music] confident to handle all that comes your way with a positive intention take a moment before we begin this relaxation process to set an intention for the day ahead the intention can be anything that resonates with you it may be a specific quality you would like to embody more in your life or an emotion you'd like to cultivate maybe you would like to focus on being mindful and staying in the present moment whatever intention is calling to you is fine [Music] once you have set your intention bring your awareness to the natural rhythm of your breath at first simply noticed the sensations that accompany your breath maybe you feel a slightly cool sensation as the air passes through your nostrils maybe you feel a floating sensation as your abdomen and chest rise and fill with breath or a heaviness as the air moves out of your body taking any attention with it maybe the breath brings a warming sensation to the body as it travels along its path whatever you're feeling is perfect simply observe the process begin to count the length of your breath in then as you breathe out invite the exhale to be one count longer than the inhale allow each exhale to carry away with it any physical and emotional stress or tension by exhaling just a little longer than you inhale your breath will slow your body and mind will calm down in response breathe in this way for a few more cycles then allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm [Music] in a moment I will guide you through a full slow body scan to take you deeper down into relaxation your body knows how to relax and sometimes a simple invitation to do so is all that it takes to release any tension pain or areas of gripping [Music] imagine that you can send your breath to any area in your body and the breath relaxes that area and make space for the energy to flow freely now as we begin to scan the body bring your attention first to the top of your head can you feel this area from the inside of your body as sensations only without moving your eyes as you scan the body simply move your awareness to each part and relax that part completely [Music] as you move your attention throughout the body you will scan for any areas of tension tightness or pain and if you find areas of tension stay on that part for a moment and send your breath into that area to soften it invite the breath to wash over any part wash away any tension like a way of moving over your body [Music] do not attach to the feelings of your body simply accept them as they are in this moment and ask your body to relax and release [Music] as you continue scanning your body you will feel this relaxing wave-like energy move through your entire body and it takes you deeper and deeper into a safe and supported state of sleep where you can build your confidence to live as your highest self [Music] and now move your attention from the top of your head down to your forehead and feel a sense of softening and smoothing [Music] continue to relax even deeper around the area of your eyebrows and eyes as you feel the tension from this area melt away your entire body softens a little further [Music] feel your eyelids becoming very heavy allow your cheeks to lengthen down and let go part your teeth unclench your jaw and relax your tongue the softening of your face and jaw will deepen the relaxation of your entire body [Music] you can now feel your throat softening notice how deep and calm your breath has become as you continue to relax deeper and deeper allowing this wave of comfort to continue its journey down your body you feel your chest and shoulders release and rest heavy every breath in oxygenate the body to promote healing and recovery from your day now allow the front and back of both arms to relax imagine water droplets flowing from your shoulders down your arms and out of your fingertips taking away all of the stress and tension that your body carries since the relaxing of the abdomen as it sinks down into the surface below you and now inviting the relaxation to continue its path down your body into your hips and lower back linger on this area a little longer and ask your body for a sense of ease let go of all of the tension and tightness held in this area feel your body softening as each breath in creates space for an easy flow of energy through your body this comfort moves into both of your legs washing relaxation over your thighs your knees your shins and your calves imagine again the droplets of water flowing out of your legs and feet washing away any remaining tension tightness or pain you feel as it flows out of your body through the bottoms of your feet so that you are completely relaxed throughout your entire body [Music] know that your relaxed body will allow for productive recovery while you sleep so you will awake feeling refreshed and rejuvenated and aligned with your intention [Music] you are now deeply relaxed and you can begin to use your imagination I will guide you on a journey taking you into a dream state where you can physically remain safe in your bed while your mind will travel to a special place of relaxation you can simply follow my voice or drift off to sleep whenever your body is ready [Music] today this journey takes you to a beautiful beach at dusk begin to imagine this Beach in vivid detail use all of your senses you can feel that the temperature is perfect for you look around at your surroundings you see the blue water [Music] it's crystal clear with gentle crashing waves you can see and hear these crashing waves and as they hit the shore each wave deep into your state of relaxation [Music] the rhythmic sounds of the flowing water brings you even deeper down into peace [Music] as you breathe in deeply you can smell the salty ocean air you can feel the warm sand under your feet as you continue to look around at this beautiful beach you see there are two chairs sitting under an umbrella off to your right and you decide to walk over to the chairs each step you take simply relaxes you even further ten you begin to walk over to the chairs and you are deeply relaxed you feel the tension melting away nine you feel yourself completely letting go of any responsibilities or things you may need to do you allow yourself to just be and drift off into a comfortable sleep eight notice how you are feeling calmer you are feeling a deep sense of relaxation you are beginning to feel sleepy seven you invite this blissful relaxed state to wash over you six you can feel your body begin the recovery and healing process that comes with deep sleep five letting go completely of the need to hold on to any tension or to guard physically for drifting deeper and deeper into the familiar heavy state of comfort three almost to the deepest level of relaxation before you fall off to sleep where your subconscious mind can build confidence - deep deep relaxation and one all the way into a deep state of relaxation and heavy comfort [Music] now that you are

1 [Music] hello and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to see your well-being and immune system strengthening as you drift off to sleep my name is Jason Stevenson and over the next short while I will guide you into a greater sense of peace health and well-being through mindful awareness and the power of visualization to settle into this practice let yourself find a comfortable lying down position [Music] whether on your back or on your side ensure that the spine is straight and your heart space is as open as is comfortable let your arms and legs soften into the surface beneath you and if you haven't already done so just closing your eyes just taking a moment here to feel into the bed or other surface that supports you and feeling a sense of gratitude for the comforts that you are provided with [Music] [Music] as remaining closed consider the roof over your head and the open air that surrounds you now visualize this open air as it becomes the breath entering into your nostrils as you inhale and being released from your body with each exhalation as you breathe mindfully let yourself soften further into the earth beneath you letting all unconscious and unnecessary tension begin to unravel [Music] as your body melts into a deeper state of relaxation the presence of stress hormones begin to decline and the immune system begins to strengthen naturally reflecting the symbiotic relationship between mind and body our physical well-being improves as we consciously and compassionately invite the mind into this present moment so take a few more moments now to witness the breath as it flows through you and with each exhalation let your bodies surrender more completely you might witness and soften the muscles around your eyes your jaw and tongue your shoulders and arms and your belly or any other part of you that feels tense in the same way that relaxing the mind promotes physical well-being relaxing the physical body encourages ease and release of the mind in a minute or two we will begin a visual journey of immune system strengthening but for now let's just take a few more moments to deepen the body's relaxation response first allow all the air in your lungs gently to be released to the atmosphere around you and together let's just take a deep full breath into the bottom of the belly and then slowly let it back out another long deep breath in and when you're ready let it back out one more full belly reaching breath now making it even longer this time and once you've reached the top slowly release all the air back out to the world around you let your breath come back to its natural rhythm now as you mindfully observe it for just a few more moments on your own now as we slowly transition into our visualization take a moment to draw your attention to the space before your closed eyes though the mind might conjure up images and ideas when left unchecked an open space of unlimited creative potential exists before the mind's eye when we slow down quiet down and tune in and it is upon this canvas now that I invite you to imagine yourself seated on a treehouse balcony overlooking a radiant singing rain forests of Central America [Music] the Sun glistens in the sky casting its light upon the treetops above you the air is warm and humid earthy and pure you take a long deep breath in and out feeling a strong but subtle wave of gratitude washed through you from where you sit or you can see is the untouched rainforest a sea of green spreading in every direction your gaze turns towards an intuitive understanding of the vitality and health of this rainforest rises to your awareness inspiring you to venture through this ecosystem to experience its restorative and healing potential and yet you take a moment now to notice how you feel in this very moment in these moments before heading on your way perhaps you feel tired perhaps you feel well or unwell perhaps you feel what you would call normal or average maybe numbness or discomfort whatever is the case view now ear on your perch above the rainforest simply notice it without attaching yourself to the feelings and sensations moving through you just notice what is here [Music] if there is any discomfort tension or unease send those sensations your love your care and your patience as you prepare for a journey into greater health vitality and immunity [Music] now you've heard that somewhere not far from the tree house lives a wise healer a mystical woman who knows all about the healing elements and herbs of this rainforest and who may be able to grant you with the greatest sense of health and well-being and so trusting your intuition to guide you in the right direction you pack a backpack with all the essentials you'll need for the day and then you begin your journey you start by climbing down from your treehouse rung by rung gently making your way onto the earth feet firmly rooted in the soil beneath you you take a moment to mindfully inhale the fresh nourishing rainforest air once again and as you exhale you take your first step down the foot path that leads you to the main road not far from your private perch in those natural lands the main road is humble and unpaved just a few metres wide it weaves its way quietly through the rainforest [Music] mindful step-by-step you make your way down it in the direction your heart guide you as you walk you note the silence between the forest symphony the air is both quiet and lively modest and confident birds call to you from the overarching canopy as does the breeze the cicadas and the howler monkeys the orchestra awakens you softening the rational and analytical mind as it guides you deeper into the beauty and mystery of the world you continued on for a short while until a path appears on your right-hand side as if silently calling you towards it you are drawn in its direction and so deciding to venture off the main road you take a leap of faith as you make your way down this narrow footpath into the unknown [Music] as you meander seemingly aimlessly you note that your body begins to shift shoulders begin to soften releasing knots of tension they have held onto for quiet some time now your belly begins to relax expanding and softening with each full deep breath your eyes begin to widen taking in more of the surroundings than they are accustomed to absorbing and your jaw begins to unclench sinking into greater comfort and ease [Music] your feet tread lightly as if kissing the earth and you sense yourself coming into greater alignment with the natural world you continue on for some time taking in the surroundings through open eyes is mind and heart great big beautiful flowers in magenta tangerine and lilac tones break up the pervading greenery of the forest meanwhile your ears continue to absorb the sounds of the nearby creatures frogs now chiming in alongside the cicadas birds and monkeys your expanded state of mind takes in the wonder of this incredible vibrant space reflecting upon how healing these natural ecosystems are how can it be you wonder that we have yet to truly learn from the wisdom of these natural ecosystems and then your heart fully expanded now takes in the love and beauty of this rainforest you feel an immense wave of gratitude wash through this loving energy center and so you silently offer a word of thanks to the natural lands you move across you thank them for providing you with just the sort of healing you had yearned for [Music] you continued on a little while further until another path comes into view this time is on your left-hand side and is even narrower than the one you are on your intuition tells you it is the path to take and so you turn down with confidence and curiosity the path weaves in and out of the tropical trees bringing you into even a closer contact with its wonder the broad leaves are close enough that they nearly brush your cheeks leaving you for a moment to question if you are going the right way and yet just as you begin to doubt the path you've chosen something opens up to you it is a small clearing in the forest in the center of it an elderly woman stands gazing up at the branches of the surrounding trees she's dressed in a long burnt orange dress and is wrapped in a loosely knit Shore the silver braided hair is wrapped in front of her left shoulder and as she stands there it seems as if she is whispering to the trees and then listening and whispering and then listening [Music] you cough quietly to let her know you were here completely unstart 'old by your presence she turns to you slowly and welcomes you with a warm smile you make your way towards her and she invites you to sit down on a long bench in the center of the clearing she sits next to you and asks what brings you here you begin to tell her that what you longed for is a greater sense of health and well-being particularly in the area of immunity you yearn for a system that is strong and resilient and you believe that perhaps this rainforest might hold what you need she embraces every word you speak and lets you know that it is possible to invite greater balance into your body through any and all acts of self-care including through the words and images you hold in your mind she invites you to begin by taking a dip in the healing blue lagoon just a short walk from her sacred circle and upon your return she will have concocted an herbal tea that will heal and balance your body and enhance its immunity you take her advice and follow the pathway she points you towards veering down a small hill and around a few more bends in the path you soon arrived at a break in the treeline we're turquoise waters reflect back at you from a short distance a small set of stairs guide you down towards the water's edge and as you step off the final stair you take a moment to absorb the fullness of this landscape you have never seen water so bright so clear so radiant after preparing to head into these cool and cleansing waters you inch your way slowly into the lagoon the water moves gently up your body until soon it has reached your waist you went to the water to as comfortable as you possibly can and if you choose to dunking your head under the water and up again [Music] the Sun is still high in the sky beaming down on you from its steady place there [Music] you close your eyes and surrender to the lagoon knowing that it will support you you take a full deep breath in and as you exhale you envision all heaviness or constriction and all imbalances leaving your body you take another full breath in and exhaling once again you envision yourself releasing all the thoughts all the ideas and all the physical imbalances that inhibit you from experiencing radiant health [Music] and now that space has been created within you for the new you consciously let your next inhalation fill you with the sun's healing energy it enters your lungs is a warm golden glow cleansing this part of the body's defense system completely then as the sun's golden light seeps further into your body it cleanses and brings balance to your lymphatic system your spleen your thymus your white blood cells and all other parts of your body's immune system [Music] as it spreads through you from within it continues to penetrate you from the outside as the Sun continues to beat down on your bare skin [Music] you spend a few more moments here soaking up the healing energy of the Sun off the breath and of the water you rest in knowing that only when all systems and elements are healthy can we experience true health and vitality [Music] when you were ready you slowly make your way back towards the shore drying yourself off with the towel and preparing to head back your entire body feels light and free full to the brim with energy and vitality you take the small pathway back to where you encountered the wise woman before she awaits your return with a fresh cup of a hot herbal tea the two of you hold silence as you bow your head and accept the mug she extends to you and as you let the warm immune-boosting liquid flow through you you trust that you already have and continue to come back into balance to come back to your innate capacity for strength vitality and resilience you pass back the empty mug and thank this woman for the blessings she has bestowed upon you and before you leave she reminds you to make sure that you prioritize your rest in the days and years to come rest of both body and mind she says is one of the most underrated and yet most important factors of a healthy internal defense system you smile thanking her once more and then you slowly head back in the direction of your very own tree house first you navigate your way down the narrow rainforest encroaching pathway towards the wider footpath then you follow this wider path until you arrive at the main road and the main road guides you back to the pathway up to your heart and before you know it you were resting on the hammock that swings on your balcony your entire body rests with ease and yet you can feel the awakened empowered energy that flows through you [Music] you remember the healing light of the Sun that entered your lungs as you floated in the turquoise lagoon and you sense its presence still within you and visioning yourself glowing from within just a few final moments and for just a few more final moments imagine the golden light of the Sun spreads through your entire being and as you slowly release the image of a healing glow within you also begin to dissolve the imagery of the rainforest [Music] [Music] coming back to the surface that supports you in this reality whether that be a bed a couch or something else you ground yourself affirmative ly back into this present moment notice the innate flow of your breath now continuing to nourish and cleanse you with each cycle follow its gently rhythm as you slowly let yourself drift into slumber [Music] goodnight [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

supported you are safe you can trust in the universe use this sensation of where you and your support meet to draw your awareness gradually from your outer experience to your inner world [Music] notice without judgment what your physical sensations are in this moment your body has the amazing ability to cope with challenges and to grow stronger from them if you allow and let go of resistance it is okay to befriend the fear that shows up for you fear is not the enemy it is a helpful and necessary emotion when it is channeled correctly as you continue to relax physically even deeper allow your attention to move inward to rest easily on your breath notice the air as it goes in and out through your nose feel your breath from within as it comes in and as it goes out like an ocean wave rolling into shore and back out again [Music] your attention on the wave of your breath will aid in deepening your peaceful state and allow sleep to easily come to you without any effort during any moments of silence if you find your mind wandering bring your attention back to your breath perhaps you may feel your stomach rise or your ribs expand as you breathe naturally or you may notice the feel of air passing through your nostrils whatever draws your attention [Music] about your natural breath let your attention easily linger here for another moment [Music] so [Music] while there are many things in life that you don't have control over your breath is one aspect that you can direct a little bit to continue relaxing and letting go even deeper invite your breath to lengthen begin to deepen your inhale for the next few cycles of breath and on your next exhalation release all the air completely letting go letting go letting go this full exhale will prepare your lungs to receive your next inhale each deep inhale brings in fresh oxygen each full exhale releases the stale air carbon dioxide and toxins each focused breath cycle is cleansing and healing you with each passing exhale you can say in your mind letting go and each release of air takes with it any tension and allows you to relax even deeper breathe in fresh oxygen breathe out letting go [Music] breathe in nourishing oxygen breathe out release any toxins or tension breathe in calmness breathe out stress breathe in light breathe out darkness breathe in love breathe out hate breathe in clarity breathe out confusion [Music] breathe in peace breathe out worry breathe in breathe out letting go allow my voice to be your guide into relaxation you can drift off to sleep when your body is ready and your subconscious mind will continue listening and relaxing like your breath slowing down your mind too can slow down in relationship to each breath as your breath and your mind slow notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen be in the gap no need to do anything simply be in this space [Music] as you continue to relax and drift towards sleep allow my voice to guide you into the most tranquil state where you are free and clear now in your mind imagine a place where you can be completely relaxed and free [Music] where you can be entirely at peace this might be a place where you have been to before or one that exists only in your mind if no specific image or visualization comes to mind easily you may consider the feeling or the energy of this space [Music] and this place is your personal sanctuary perhaps you might feel this freedom on a beach or a calm trail in the woods or maybe your mind takes you to a special place in your home whatever feels right to you is simply perfect this is your personal sanctuary it is your ideal spot for relaxation and peace see this special place in your mind's eye [Music] in as much detail as you can experience your sanctuary using all your senses as you rest in this personal peaceful sanctuary know that you are safe within yourself [Music]

takes place [Music] and will continue through the night as you sleep as you rest easy in your safe and peaceful sanctuary consider the times in life when releasing gives way to growth [Music] trees must let go of leaves in the fall to have the opportunity for new growth [Music] waves in the ocean flow in to the shore and back out again creating a natural ebb and flow many animals must shed their skin or outer layer in order to grow humans have a period of exhalation to make room for the next inhalation consider the times when resistance creates more difficulty for example the spinning wheels of a car in mud the more you try to get out the deeper the wheels dig into the mud can you find any areas where you are holding on and then let go [Music] perhaps you may be holding at the area of your stomach can you let go can you open the flow of energy within you continue to connect with relaxation and letting go as deeply as you can practice surrender practice letting go open to the healing energy within are you able to relax even more connect even deeper to yourself [Music] listen to your heart surrender to your inner wisdom let go of your body further and further into relaxation let go and drift effortlessly into peace let go of any thoughts of worry any thoughts that might be holding you back from experiencing tranquility let go of any thoughts holding you back from sleep [Music] see these thoughts drift off in the wave of relaxation they will be there when you need them in this calm state of your mind let go of worries so that you can sleep peacefully now what you resist persists acknowledge your thoughts with acceptance without the need to follow them into story meet your present experience with permission allow your thoughts to come and go without resistance welcoming a calmness to wash over you [Music] completely [Music] let go of anything you might be holding on to from yesterday or earlier today let go of anything that may be taking up space in your mind give yourself permission to be here right now sometimes we need to invite the idea of offering ourselves permission to let go of the past give yourself some space for something new

ready to drift to sleep adjust your environment and posture so you can have the feeling of complete safety and support [Music] as we begin allow your eyes to close gently and begin to relax notice your breath now without making any changes to your breath recognize how it flows in through your nose and fills up your body with life [Music] follow the flow of the air as it comes into your body through your nostrils and notice how your chest and abdomen rise and fall naturally as the breath comes in and goes out the breath can be your anchor or your reminder to remain present with your experience when you focus on your breath you are always focused in the present you cannot get back a past breath and you cannot breathe in a future breath before the present moment as you continue to stay with your breath allow it to flow naturally release any physical and emotional tension with each exhale [Music] let any tightness drift away from your experience and now begin to deepen each breath in and out as your breath fills you up more fully focus your attention on the space that comes between the inhale and the exhale allow this stillness to last a little longer pausing momentarily between each inhale and exhale and as you breathe in this way for a few more cycles feel the tension easily release from your body give yourself permission to be fully supported safe and embraced by the nourishing energy around you you can be open to the possibilities of what comes with this state of comfort allow the sounds and the responsibilities of the world around you to turn off or be tuned out as you continue to relax you may still have thoughts going through your mind and that's okay notice them from afar as if you are an observer and invite the space between your thoughts to extend just as you did with the space between your breaths in just a moment i will guide you to continue this practice of awareness as you bring your attention to your physical body to deepen your relaxation and your connection with yourself as you hear each part of your body being named you will first bring your awareness to that part noticing how it feels without judgment and then by simply paying attention you will relax that part fully now turn your attention to the top of your head visualize and feel your scalp and head and then relax notice how powerful your awareness is and how just a thought in your mind can have the ability to relax you so deeply continue this scan of your body as you feel your forehead soften and smooth next invite ease into your eyes allowing the tiny muscles
