it has been said that one hour of yoga nidra equates to four hours of deep
sleep because we go through all of the brainwave stages you typically go
through during sleep only in a compressed amount of time using this
systematic approach to full body and mind relaxation can help you connect
with your own true and natural wisdom your ability for healing and relieving
stress if you are feeling stressed this practice can be just what you need to
experience inner peace and joy it is also a great way to help you fall asleep
and sleep deeply if you practice before bed get ready to heal and restore your
body quiet your mind and bring compassion and love into your heart
hello and welcome I'm Sara Raymond from the mindful movement here we are on
Oasis where you can come to tap into your inner peace positive mindset and
the ability for self healing before you begin to settle into your comfortable
yoga nidra posture it is important for you to set a specific intention or
personal resolve for the practice so you can commit to it at the start let it
sink into your subconscious during and revisit it when the practice is coming
to a close this intention is called a San culpa this San culpa can help you make a
positive change in your life as your brain enters delta-wave frequencies where you are very receptive to change
for your San culpa choose something that aligns with your deepest desires
this statement is positive in nature and is in the present tense you may choose
to start the statement using the words I am as you are solidifying your intention
feel it in your heart as if it is true
perhaps imagine what your life might be like when it is true you can keep the
same San culpa for as long as you like and come back to this practice frequently to send a consistent message
to your subconscious feel free to pause this recording to take time to set your
intention maybe write it down on a small piece of paper to keep with you after
your practice is complete now I would
like to take a brief moment to give you some suggestions for your setup as it is
important to be extremely comfortable and feel safe in the position you choose
for your yoga nidra practice you can choose to lie down on the floor or in
your bed for this practice you will want to be fully supported the intent is not
to go to sleep it is to relax your body fully so you can relax your mind and let
go of stress you may choose to have your head and shoulders slightly elevated to
make sure you stay awake you can use a yoga bolster a pillow a rolled blanket
or towel under your knees to make sure there is no strain in your lower back
you may like a pillow or a blanket under your head as well and I recommend
covering up with a blanket as your body temperature will drop as you become more
and more relaxed and finally if you like you can
cover your eyes with a washcloth or eye pillow
now I invite you to make yourself comfortable close your eyes if you like
and settle into comfort [Music]
let your body sink into the surface below you make any shifts in your body
to let yourself settle deeper into the support
you can be comforted to know that at this time there is nowhere to go nothing
to do everything is okay you have set
aside this time to simply feel your body and listen come into stillness now for
deep rest and deep nourishment do not
worry if you don't hear everything I say it is natural to flow in and out of
consciousness the deepest part of you is listening
bring your attention to your environment around you
listen to the farthest sound outside the room listen to the closest sounds inside
the room allow yourself a moment to become aware
of anything else you can sense any
smells
anything you can see inside your closed eyelids
or perhaps the temperature of the air around you
allow your attention to move inward for a moment and discover a safe place
within a place where you feel secure and
loved this may be a feeling within your body
or a visualization of an actual place where you feel safe know that you may
return your attention to this place anytime you need it
now in your mind remember your intention or San culpa and stated three times feel
it in your heart and body as if it is true now
letting your San culpa go for now
visualize your own body resting and become aware of your own physical
presence
[Music] allow the weight of your body and your
bones to become heavy [Music]
feel your bones sinking into the support
allow your awareness to follow the sound of my voice and travel through your body
now on a journey of sensation simply
feel each part as it is mentioned as you remain still and relax deeper
welcome all sensations you experience just as they are begin by noticing where
your head meets the support below you
allow your head to feel heavy and supported resting fully allow your face
to relax letting go of any facial expressions to soften anywhere you can
now in your mind you can let your awareness visit the areas in your body
as you hear them
moving your awareness to your face sensing your mouth feel your mouth feel
sensations inside of your mouth
notice your jaw lips
and where your upper lip touches your lower lip
since the inside of your mouth your teeth gums and your tongue feel the
inside of your cheeks feel all of your face now as a whole
inviting yourself to relax deeper and deeper
in your mind find your right hand no

now bring your attention down to your left hip thigh knee lower leg and ankle
since the top of your left foot the big toe second toe third toe fourth toe and
pinky toe notice the bottom of your foot
your heel and since your entire foot
since your abdomen now relaxing your belly as well as your lower back notice
any tension here dissolving away from your abdomen back and hips
bring your awareness to your neck and throat as you soften here relax your jaw
letting your teeth part and softening the area of the corners of your mouth
noticing your tongue relaxing inside your mouth since your right eye eyelid
and eye socket relax completely and your
left eye eyelid and eye socket
[Music] since both eyes together noticing a
softening notice your right ear inner
and outer ear and your left ear inner
and outer ear and both ears together
and since your entire head and face as a whole to relax completely
invite any remaining holding or tension to let go from anywhere in your body
bring your awareness now to your breath since your natural breath as it flows
through you feel the in-breath and the
out-breath notice your breathing as it
comes and goes
noticing your breath you can relax further if you wish remember this is a
time to consciously relax remind
yourself to stay awake and alert yet
relaxed watch your breath closely
without manipulating it simply experience your breath since it
feel it follow it
attach no judgment to it simply experience your breath fully since the
sound of your breath allowing this to be
the object of your attention to relax your mind and body further
the soft subtle sound is the breath of life
when your mind wanders during this practice bring your attention back to
the feeling of your breath feel your
breath entering into your body through your nostrils
follow the path of your breath as it moves into your chest and abdomen and
follow the path as your breath moves back out through your nostrils
you may feel enlivened by the inhale and
relaxed by the exhale
feel each breath as energy moving through you inhale with a sense of
energetic expansion or inspiration
exhale with a sense of letting go of tension letting go of any need to hold
on or control
because you can let go with every exhale you can make room you can more clearly
focus on what's important to you
you may notice with the attention on your breath it is slowed down it has
relaxed you
like your breath slowing down your mind to can slow down with every breath
you may sense more space between your breaths as well as more space between
your thoughts as you inhale and exhale
you may imagine a wave passing upward and downward throughout your body
carrying away tensions bringing a sense
of calm to every cell inside your body
now scan through your internal sensations to observe what is there for
you right now with acceptance as if you are offering
permission to your experience rather than judgment start with your physical
experience do you feel a sensation of
floating or lightness do you feel other
areas of sinking or heaviness
can you sense these opposites at the same time
light and heavy coexisting
scan through your body to notice any areas that feel comfortable
and any areas that might feel uncomfortable
[Music] noticing back and forth between the two
sensations and since areas of comfort and
discomfort at the same time coexisting
[Music]
become aware of your emotions now since
the physical feelings of your emotions and where in your body you may
experience them scan through your body
for the physical sensations that are associated with emotions notice with
curiosity and acceptance
experience your emotions just as they are
looking inward for what you're feeling right now is there contentment or peace
or do you sense agitation do you perhaps
sense both peace and agitation at the same time
what are other qualities you are aware of when you quietly observe
look inward not inwards or labels
but in sensations and feelings without judgment
when you acknowledge and accept these emotions you can allow the energy to
move through you these sensations and
the awareness of the sensations the listening inward allows you to connect
with your body in your heart experience
the emotion and the physical sensations rather than think of this emotion and
the stories that are associated with it
open to all of it
awakening to the full experience of life as a balance of sweet and sadness
comfort and discomfort blissful moments
as well as difficulties
when you connect with and sit with this energy it doesn't have to rule you as it
moves through you this energy can awaken you to the full experience of life let
go of the fear of the emotion and allow it to awaken you let go of the tendency
for avoidance of emotion and lean into it as a message from within
[Music]
as you continue this relaxed inward awareness become aware of any thoughts
arising witness them as if you are
witnessing a flowing river of thoughts see them surface flow by and disappear
each breath cycle naturally Rises and is
released similarly our thoughts rise and
are then released let this idea this
knowledge be a comfort to you to allow your thoughts to drift down the flowing
river of thoughts as you observe them
you may find it helpful to name these thoughts as they arise
identify them as a way to simply be aware of thinking after they have been
named witness them as one drop of water
in the flowing river of thoughts moving
with each of the other thoughts rising and falling and flowing away
like your breath rising and falling away your thoughts to rise and fall away
no matter how many thoughts come up allow them to flow by
if you find yourself following a thought or reacting to a thought bring your
attention back to the sensations of your breath
if we resist the current of the flowing river of thoughts it will continue to
rush against us pushing an opposition
perhaps giving you the feeling of being stuck if we accept it allow it we drift
effortlessly along with the current the
awareness of your thoughts allows you to let go of the hold they may have on you
continue noticing your thoughts as they arise and allow them to fall away
you may even notice your thoughts coming with more space between them
when you practice allowing them to rise and fall as with each cycle of breath
if you find you get swept up with a thought with compassion for yourself and
patience bring your awareness back to your breath
[Music] allow yourself to go further still into
relaxation since a safe place inside you
a place where you feel secure and loved
since the place where your inner joy that you were born with is within you
remaining as relaxed and calm as you can invite your imagination to call to mind
a person a friend or loved one that
makes you smile simply by thinking of them this person is someone that is easy
to love your love for this person flows naturally
perhaps this individual brings you joy
allow the image and the energy of this person to rest within your heart make
space for the image or the energy of this person to stay within you perhaps
imagine your heart expanding with love that you feel for this person see and
feel joy and happiness from this person
perhaps do you think of a specific experience or just the nature of this
individual feel their joy their happiness if at any point you find your
mind wandering let the feeling of joy and happiness bring your attention back
and now imagine sharing their joy
imagine lifting each other up supporting each other and experiencing joy together
since this joy not only in your heart but throughout your entire body connect
with this loved ones joy and positive energy as if it is intertwining with
your own
as you continue to stay with the sensations of joy and happiness in your
heart you can repeat the following phrases in your mind or simply send
positive energy to that individual that brings you joy may you appreciate the
joy in your life may your joy continue
and grow may you live with joy and
gratitude always [Music]
may you appreciate the joy in your life
may your joy continue and grow may you
live with joy and gratitude always
let go of these memories and sense that joy is still within you it is always
present and you can call upon it anytime you wish
now allow yourself to go deeper still allow all of the thoughts to go let your
scanning awareness drift off simply be
present with your truest self letting
all the layers of yourself dissolve
let what seems like boundaries blur
since a place inside of you that is the place of your inner wisdom your
intuition your truest self here inside
you is where your present awareness and insights reside when you pause and
simply be your mind stops and you open
into expansiveness open into
spaciousness [Music]
take a moment now to open yourself up and be receptive to whatever you find
here open to any messages that arise
during this introspective time [Music]
[Music]
now remember your San culpa bring your
intention back to mind
repeat your San culpa in your mind several times
feel it in your heart planting the seed
to grow as you begin to transition out of yoga nidra
begin to move your awareness outward again becoming aware of your breath
follow your breath awaken gradually with
each passing breath become aware of your
heart and breathe into this space let
the energy of your heart move outward and awaken you as you become more and
more aware become aware of the room
around you perhaps you notice the sounds around you
listening to your environment
in your own time begin to move away from your practice moving and stretching your
body in any way that feels good to you
waking up your body your mind and your heart to go on with your day with your
intention and mind when you are ready
open your eyes
