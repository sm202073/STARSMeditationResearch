welcome this guided meditation is to help you sue the feelings of anxiety
before bed so that you can fall asleep easily and have a peaceful night's sleep
meditation before bed is a wonderful way to quiet the racing thoughts and to get ready for the day or week ahead
please do not use this as a substitute for seeking the advice of a medical professional if necessary the mind is a
complex process sometimes we find ourselves overwhelmed by where our mind
can take us ideally as we become more self-aware through our practice we learn
how to use our mind as a tool many of us have difficulty with this concept or
have not yet begun that path when our mind uses us instead it can lead us in
various directions when this happens we are subject to the reactions we may have
to our thoughts and our life situations
this is often what triggers feelings of anxiety when our mind takes us to future
moments we can feel worried or even panic over what's to come
anxiety is on some level living in the future nothing ever happens in the
future though everything happens in the present moment getting in touch with the
present moment and the timeless beauty of the now and accepting it fully with love and non judgment that is where the
answer to anxiety lies many people deal
with feelings of anxiety on a regular basis understanding some of the details on a basic level can help set your path
towards an anxiety free life first of all anxiety cannot hurt you even though
it might feel otherwise in the moment it is important to recognize this it is
basically a shift in activity in the brain from one area to another it may
create physical symptoms that appear at times quite severe it can even replicate
feeling similar to a real physical concern being able to recognize these feelings
for what they are just a temporary shift towards the sympathetic nervous system also known as the fight-or-flight
response is a powerful step towards healing
[Music] once we understand and truly believe
that these feelings no matter how powerful can do us no harm we can accept
them without judgment in fact as an observer of our bodies we want to
welcome these feelings oftentimes it's the fear of anxiety that triggers
further anxious sensations if we truly do not fear them they will begin to
dissolve welcome them as The Watcher of your body as if you are expecting these
feelings see these feelings as a teaching tool as though you are
completely okay with them smile at them smile with every cell in your body and
as your love shines its light the darkness will fade
oftentimes this anxiety creeps up around bedtime when we begin to consider what's
in store for the next day or the week ahead it is the idea of living in the
future today I will invite you into your
present moment to let go of the past and
have confidence in what the future holds I will guide you to attend to your
breath and your physical sensations in this present moment
with this practice you can peacefully drift off to sleep take a moment and
make sure you are in a safe place to drift off to sleep if you choose if you
need to pause this video that's okay [Music]
make sure your room is dark and you are very comfortable if you are listening to
this on an electronic device turn the screens light away from you create the
most comfortable environment that you can
[Music] once you are ready to begin the journey to sleep bring your attention to your
breath and invite the feeling of
settling into your space knowing you are exactly where you need to be
I'm going to count to three and then I would like you to take a deep breath in
through your nose and as you exhale gently close your eyes and soften your
body one two three
[Music]
let's repeat that cycle two more times gently open your eyes one two three
breathe in deeply and relax on your exhale letting your eyes close one more
time softly open your eyes one two three
breathe in deep and relax letting your
eyes shut down and your whole body relaxed
and with your eyes closed now allow your breath to become natural
[Music] knowing that the body knows what to do
to breathe to relax and to recover and
rejuvenate while you sleep and now
simply be aware of the sensations in your body that are associated with the
natural rhythm of your breath [Music]
notice the cool air of the passes into your nostrils and how the air is a
little warmer as it flows out of your body feel as the chest and belly rise
and fall and rhythm with the breath
[Music] as you continue breathing naturally
begin to sense the pause that occurs between the exhale and the next inhale
keep your attention on this momentary pause for the next few breaths using
this pause to come back to each present moment use this pause to let go of the
worry about the future to let go of the need for perfection to let go of the
shoulds [Music]
if your attention drifts away from your breath which it likely will noticing a
sound or a thought or a physical sensation lovingly return your attention
to the next breath and the next pause
continue focusing on your breath as you invite your body to soften and reacts
each natural exhale takes you deeper into relaxation and closer to peaceful
sleep allow yourself to let go of all
the stress from your day
let go of your to-do list for the future
and now gently move your attention to your body first focus your attention on
your face as you exhale let go of all
the muscles of your face
[Music] relax your forehead relax the tiny
muscles around your eyes and your cheeks
unclench your jaw and think into the
surface below you
continue to watch your breath as you let go of the muscles in your neck and your
shoulders [Music]
relax your arms relax your back
[Music] let go of all of the muscles in your
belly and your hips
let go of any tension in your legs
invite the sensation of relaxation to let everything go
you are now very relaxed you are feeling
very comfortable and you are enjoying a sense of inner peace that is soothing
and quieting your mind
slowly complete one more scan of your body sensations from your head all the
way down throughout your entire body
and as you do breathe deeply into any
areas of remaining tension to completely let go
[Music] inviting your body to go deeper into
relaxation
you now I would like you to imagine watching
yourself as an observer outside of your own body
imagine yourself in a place where you have known to have the sense of anxiety
in the past
maybe it's at work or at home or possibly in a social situation
I would like you to see yourself going through your day when you begin to
notice these unwanted feelings coming on as the observer notice that you are not
