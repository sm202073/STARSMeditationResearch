hello and welcome to this short
guided meditation that will help you to
relax
deeply as you release and transform
any troubles you are experiencing with
the help of the ocean's waves
my name is jason stevenson and i invite
you to open your heart
and mind to this transformative practice
let the top of your head stretch up
towards the ceiling
and your shoulders to soften towards the
earth
eyes closed and turn your attention
inwards as you observe the gentle rhythm
of your breathing
and as you watch the breath flow into
and out of your lungs notice how it
resembles the steady flow of waves
against a sandy beach
in this moment your body is the shore
and the breath is the ebb and flow
of nature's mysterious force
take a few moments to let the breath
naturally guide you into a deeper state
of relaxation
just as the ocean's waves tend to lull
us
into a place of peace and tranquility
soften your belly as you breathe and
relax your shoulders
seeing if the breath might like to move
a bit deeper
into your body you don't need to force
anything
simply observe the rhythm that is
present
and now i invite you to turn your
attention towards the mind's eye
to the seat of your capacity for
inspired visualization
and from within this space i invite you
to imagine that you were standing
firmly grounded on a warm
tropical beach
the ocean just a dozen meters ahead of
you
sparkles beneath the beaming sun
soft waves crash gently against the
steady shore
forever flowing back out to the vastness
from which they came
the air is a comfortable temperature
warming each cell bone
and corner of your soul
you look left and right
realizing that no one is here but you
this healing space is all yours to enjoy
in peace and tranquility
so take a moment to ground yourself by
feeling the soles of your feet
against the multitude of grains of sand
beneath
you
the warmth from this surface permeates
up through your legs
your pelvis
running up the length of your spine
and then expanding outwards through your
arms
and up to the crown of your head
you tilt your head gently as your face
extends
towards the sun
and you begin to feel any weight you've
been carrying
melt from your body
take a long deep breath in
and out
and slowly you make your way closer
towards the water's edge
you pause just a few meters away from it
and settle yourself into the sand
coming to a seated position
feel into the sensation of the warm
sandy surface embracing
each inch of your skin that comes into
contact with it
as you sink into this unfolding moment
you begin to surrender any barriers that
exist within you
to experience deep peace
and relaxation
you know that in this moment
there is nothing you need to do
nothing you need to accomplish
and nothing you need to be
you know that you are enough as you are
and that this moment is enough
as it is
and as you watch the luminous waves
crashing against the sandy shore just
before you
you offer up to these transformative
waters
any troubles you've been experiencing
lately
all limitation or challenging thoughts
feelings emotions and stories
leave your body with each breath out
and as the energy of these thoughts and
feelings
flow through the breeze towards the
ocean
you watch as they are swept away for
healing and transformation
as each wave rushes back
into the ocean abyss
take some time consciously
offer up anything you might like to
release to these cleansing waters
watch all of your troubles be
washed gracefully away
and when you were ready take a moment to
come back
to the simple beauty of this relaxing
space
to the sounds of the wondrous waves
to the nourishment of each cleansing
breath
and to the warm glow of the soothing sun
allow yourself to relax upon this serene
beach
for just a few more silent breaths
slowly now let the imagery of this
tranquil landscape dissolve
as you take three deep and grounding
breaths
on your own rhythm
and after that last long exhale
let your breath return to its natural
cycle
and when you feel ready to come back to
the world around you
slowly open your eyes
you might want to spend some time here
just over the next five minutes
listening to the sounds of the waves as
you slowly come back
let the relaxing energy of this beach
move you
through the day ahead or the evening
tapping into your inner source of peace
and release again
and again
you
