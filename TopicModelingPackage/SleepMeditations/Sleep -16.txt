[Music]
hello and welcome to this guided meditation that will help you to see
your well-being and immune system strengthening as you drift off to sleep
my name is Jason Stevenson and over the next short while I will guide you into a
greater sense of peace health and well-being through mindful awareness and
the power of visualization to settle
into this practice let yourself find a comfortable lying down position
[Music] whether on your back or on your side
ensure that the spine is straight and your heart space is as open as is
comfortable
let your arms and legs soften into the surface beneath you and if you haven't
already done so just closing your eyes
just taking a moment here to feel into the bed or other surface that supports
you and feeling a sense of gratitude for the comforts that you are provided with
[Music]
[Music] as remaining closed consider the roof
over your head and the open air that
surrounds you now visualize this open
air as it becomes the breath entering into your nostrils as you inhale and
being released from your body with each exhalation
as you breathe mindfully let yourself soften further into the earth beneath
you letting all unconscious and unnecessary tension begin to unravel
[Music]
as your body melts into a deeper state of relaxation the presence of stress
hormones begin to decline and the immune system begins to strengthen naturally
reflecting the symbiotic relationship between mind and body our physical
well-being improves as we consciously and compassionately invite the mind into
this present moment
so take a few more moments now to witness the breath as it flows through
you and with each exhalation let your
bodies surrender more completely
you might witness and soften the muscles around your eyes
your jaw and tongue your shoulders and
arms and your belly
or any other part of you that feels tense in the same way that relaxing the
mind promotes physical well-being relaxing the physical body encourages
ease and release of the mind
in a minute or two we will begin a visual journey of immune system
strengthening but for now let's just take a few more moments to deepen the
body's relaxation response first allow
all the air in your lungs gently to be released to the atmosphere around you
and together let's just take a deep full breath into the bottom of the belly and
then slowly let it back out another long
deep breath in and when you're ready let it back out
one more full belly reaching breath now making it even longer this time and once
you've reached the top slowly release all the air back out to the world around you let your breath come back to its
natural rhythm now as you mindfully observe it for just a few more moments on your own
now as we slowly transition into our visualization take a moment to draw your
attention to the space before your closed eyes
though the mind might conjure up images and ideas when left unchecked an open
space of unlimited creative potential exists before the mind's eye when we
slow down quiet down and tune in and it
is upon this canvas now that I invite you to imagine yourself seated on a
treehouse balcony overlooking a radiant singing rain forests of Central America
[Music] the Sun glistens in the sky casting its
light upon the treetops above you the
air is warm and humid earthy and pure you take a long deep breath in and out
feeling a strong but subtle wave of gratitude washed through you from where
you sit or you can see is the untouched rainforest a sea of green spreading in
every direction your gaze turns towards an intuitive understanding of the
vitality and health of this rainforest rises to your awareness inspiring you to
venture through this ecosystem to experience its restorative and healing
potential and yet you take a moment now to notice
how you feel in this very moment in these moments before heading on your way
perhaps you feel tired perhaps you feel well or unwell perhaps you feel what you
would call normal or average maybe numbness or discomfort
whatever is the case view now ear on your perch above the rainforest simply
notice it without attaching yourself to the feelings and sensations moving
through you just notice what is here [Music]
if there is any discomfort tension or
unease send those sensations your love
your care and your patience as you prepare for a journey into greater
health vitality and immunity
[Music]
now you've heard that somewhere not far from the tree house lives a wise healer
a mystical woman who knows all about the healing elements and herbs of this
rainforest and who may be able to grant you with the greatest sense of health
and well-being and so trusting your intuition to guide
you in the right direction you pack a backpack with all the essentials you'll
need for the day and then you begin your
journey you start by climbing down from your treehouse rung by rung gently
making your way onto the earth
feet firmly rooted in the soil beneath you you take a moment to mindfully
inhale the fresh nourishing rainforest air once again and as you exhale you
take your first step down the foot path that leads you to the main road
not far from your private perch in those natural lands the main road is humble
and unpaved just a few metres wide it
weaves its way quietly through the rainforest [Music]
mindful step-by-step you make your way
down it in the direction your heart guide you as you walk you note the
silence between the forest symphony the air is both quiet and lively modest and
confident
birds call to you from the overarching canopy as does the breeze the cicadas
and the howler monkeys the orchestra
awakens you softening the rational and analytical mind as it guides you deeper
into the beauty and mystery of the world
you continued on for a short while until a path appears on your right-hand side
as if silently calling you towards it you are drawn in its direction
and so deciding to venture off the main road you take a leap of faith as you
make your way down this narrow footpath into the unknown
[Music] as you meander seemingly aimlessly you
note that your body begins to shift shoulders begin to soften
releasing knots of tension they have held onto for quiet some time now
your belly begins to relax expanding and
softening with each full deep breath
your eyes begin to widen taking in more
of the surroundings than they are accustomed to absorbing
and your jaw begins to unclench sinking
into greater comfort and ease
[Music] your feet tread lightly as if kissing
the earth and you sense yourself coming into greater alignment with the natural
world
you continue on for some time taking in the surroundings through open eyes is
mind and heart great big beautiful
flowers in magenta tangerine and lilac
tones break up the pervading greenery of the forest meanwhile your ears continue
to absorb the sounds of the nearby creatures frogs now chiming in alongside
the cicadas birds and monkeys
your expanded state of mind takes in the wonder of this incredible vibrant space
reflecting upon how healing these natural ecosystems are
how can it be you wonder that we have yet to truly learn from the
wisdom of these natural ecosystems
and then your heart fully expanded now
takes in the love and beauty of this rainforest you feel an immense wave of
gratitude wash through this loving energy center and so you silently offer
a word of thanks to the natural lands you move across you thank them for
providing you with just the sort of healing you had yearned for
[Music]
you continued on a little while further until another path comes into view this
time is on your left-hand side and is even narrower than the one you are on
your intuition tells you it is the path to take and so you turn down with
confidence and curiosity
the path weaves in and out of the tropical trees bringing you into even a
closer contact with its wonder the broad
leaves are close enough that they nearly brush your cheeks leaving you for a
moment to question if you are going the right way and yet just as you begin to
doubt the path you've chosen something opens up to you it is a small clearing
in the forest in the center of it an elderly woman
stands gazing up at the branches of the surrounding trees she's dressed in a
long burnt orange dress and is wrapped in a loosely knit Shore the silver
braided hair is wrapped in front of her left shoulder and as she stands there it
seems as if she is whispering to the trees and then listening
and whispering
and then listening [Music]
you cough quietly to let her know you were here completely unstart 'old by your presence
she turns to you slowly and welcomes you with a warm smile you make your way
towards her and she invites you to sit down on a long bench in the center of
the clearing she sits next to you and asks what brings you here you begin to
tell her that what you longed for is a greater sense of health and well-being
particularly in the area of immunity you yearn for a system that is strong and
resilient and you believe that perhaps this rainforest might hold what you need
she embraces every word you speak and lets you know that it is possible to
invite greater balance into your body through any and all acts of self-care
including through the words and images you hold in your mind she invites you to
begin by taking a dip in the healing blue lagoon just a short walk from her
sacred circle and upon your return she
will have concocted an herbal tea that will heal and balance your body and
enhance its immunity
you take her advice and follow the pathway she points you towards
veering down a small hill and around a few more bends in the path you soon
arrived at a break in the treeline we're turquoise waters reflect back at
you from a short distance a small set of
stairs guide you down towards the water's edge
and as you step off the final stair you
take a moment to absorb the fullness of this landscape you have never seen water
so bright so clear so radiant
after preparing to head into these cool and cleansing waters you inch your way
slowly into the lagoon the water moves
gently up your body until soon it has
reached your waist
you went to the water to as comfortable as you possibly can
and if you choose to dunking your head under the water and up again
[Music] the Sun is still high in the sky beaming
down on you from its steady place there [Music]
you close your eyes and surrender to the lagoon knowing that it will support you
you take a full deep breath in and as
you exhale you envision all heaviness or constriction and all imbalances leaving
your body you take another full breath in and
exhaling once again you envision yourself releasing all the thoughts all
the ideas and all the physical imbalances that inhibit you from
experiencing radiant health
[Music] and now that space has been created within you for the new you consciously
let your next inhalation fill you with the sun's healing energy it enters your
lungs is a warm golden glow cleansing this part of the body's defense system
completely
then as the sun's golden light seeps further into your body it cleanses and
brings balance to your lymphatic system your spleen your thymus your white blood
cells and all other parts of your body's
immune system
[Music] as it spreads through you from within it
continues to penetrate you from the outside as the Sun continues to beat
down on your bare skin
[Music]
you spend a few more moments here soaking up the healing energy of the Sun
off the breath and of the water you rest in knowing that only when all systems
and elements are healthy can we experience true health and vitality
[Music]
when you were ready you slowly make your way back towards the shore drying
yourself off with the towel and preparing to head back your entire body
feels light and free full to the brim with energy and vitality
you take the small pathway back to where you encountered the wise woman before she awaits your return with a fresh cup
of a hot herbal tea
the two of you hold silence as you bow your head and accept the mug she extends
to you and as you let the warm immune-boosting
liquid flow through you you trust that you already have and continue to come
back into balance to come back to your innate capacity for strength vitality
and resilience
you pass back the empty mug and thank this woman for the blessings she has
bestowed upon you and before you leave
she reminds you to make sure that you prioritize your rest in the days and
years to come rest of both body and mind she says is
one of the most underrated and yet most important factors of a healthy internal
defense system you smile thanking her
once more and then you slowly head back in the direction of your very own tree
house
first you navigate your way down the narrow rainforest encroaching pathway
towards the wider footpath then you
follow this wider path until you arrive at the main road and the main road
guides you back to the pathway up to your heart
and before you know it you were resting on the hammock that swings on your
balcony
your entire body rests with ease and yet you can feel the awakened empowered
energy that flows through you
[Music] you remember the healing light of the Sun that entered your lungs as you
floated in the turquoise lagoon and you
sense its presence still within you and visioning yourself glowing from within
just a few final moments
and for just a few more final moments imagine the golden light of the Sun
spreads through your entire being
and as you slowly release the image of a healing glow within you also begin to
dissolve the imagery of the rainforest [Music]
[Music] coming back to the surface that supports you in this reality whether that be a
bed a couch or something else you ground
yourself affirmative ly back into this present moment
notice the innate flow of your breath now continuing to nourish and cleanse
you with each cycle follow its gently
rhythm as you slowly let yourself drift
into slumber [Music]
