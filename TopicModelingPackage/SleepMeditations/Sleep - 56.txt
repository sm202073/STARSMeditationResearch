hello and welcome to this guided meditation this is the positive miracles
guided sleep meditation I'm Jason Stephenson we're often told
about the importance and power of being positive but knowing that we should be
positive is one thing but actually being positive is another and when the day's
stresses pile up and things don't work our way it's too easy to give in to our
emotions and feel anything but positive and it makes it harder for us to go to
sleep when this continues we sometimes give in to feelings of inadequacy believing that
we're not good enough or worthy enough and never will be at the very worst we
may begin to suspect that there's a vast conspiracy determined to foil us at every turn and thus cynics are born
these perpetuate a terrible cycle they believe they're not good enough or that
things will never work their way they therefore become blind to wonderful
opportunities awaiting them at every corner thus reinforcing their own beliefs and this is the prison of
negative thinking now this meditation is the antidote to such a prison the aim of
this meditation is to get you to sleep with miracles of positive and kind
intentions so let's begin
now for this one you can prepare as you would go into sleep lying down on your back or you can sit upright with your
spine straight and this allows you to maintain an upright but comfortable position without strain to help you
breathe more easily and maintain a good balance let your shoulders relax and
rest your hands palms up on your lap or by your side if you are lying down this
stabilizes you rolls your shoulders back and opens up your rib cage
now facing straight ahead and pretend that you're the CEO of a major company
or the ruler of a powerful country in your hands lies the fate of millions you
are a very important person so project your power through your upright and
confident but relaxed posture
and because of who and what you are you have earned the right to just be for now
all appointments meetings schedules and deadlines they can all wait but now they
must take a back seat to what you are about to do so keeping your lips closed
relax your jaw so that there's a gap between your teeth and rest the tip of
your tongue against the back of your upper teeth gently close your eyes so
your work can begin now please pay
attention to your breathing and notice how it moves in and out of your body and
how your body responds to it and that's breathing now in and out through your
nose
notice how your body feels a sense of expansion as you breathe in and how your
body contracts as you exhale
bring your focus now to your stomach and as you breathe in bring the breath here
so that it bloats with each inhalation and as you exhale feel your stomach
contract
you
[Music]
so in a few more moments I'm going to direct your breath by asking you to inhale and to exhale to a slow count of
three ready inhale one one-thousand two
one-thousand three one-thousand exhale one one-thousand two one-thousand three
one-thousand inhale 1 2 3 exhale 1 2 3
inhale
exhale now trying to keep this pattern of
slower breathing for the remainder of this meditation just slowing it down
naturally you don't have to mentally count each breath but just seeing if you can keep it nice and slow and steady
maintain your focus on breathing into your stomach so it expands with each
in-breath and contracts with each out breath you can visualize that your
stomach is a balloon that grows and shrinks with each inhalation and
exhalation
you
you still maintaining the pace of your
breath think back to an incident where you put a smile on someone's face now
you don't have to remember their names all that matters is that you made someone happy and that you did it with
no thought of getting something back it
doesn't have to be something major it could be something as simple as holding the door open for someone or giving a
child a piece of candy or offering someone a sincere compliment that made
their day
now if several incidents come to mind pick the one where the recipient of your
kindness expressed a genuine gratitude can you remember what they said or what
they did just dwell in that memory for a
few moments and try to recall as much detail as you can
[Music] do you remember how you felt in that
moment did the other person's reaction
surprised you maybe it made you feel good
maintain your even breathing but just keep that memory and enjoy the feeling
I'd like you now to remember a time when someone did you a kind Act
preferably one that you so badly needed but never expected
now again you don't have to know the person's name or even remember the details of their face just try to recall
as much of the incident as you can did
it happen at night or during the day what happened just before the person or
persons came along did you ask for help or did they just volunteer to help what
did they do to help you
do you remember how you felt in that moment did you feel surprised grateful
did you express your gratitude if so how
did it make you feel valued noticed no longer invisible that there are indeed
good people in the world just take a moment to explore that memory and to
relive what you felt
still maintaining the slow even pace of your breath I'd like you to consider the
following thought the gratitude you've felt toward another was the same
gratitude that another felt toward you it might be a feeling of lightness and
peace one where the world seemed right even if only for a moment but the person
to whom you were kind they too felt what you are now feeling that the world
seemed right because they were good and kind people in it people like you no
matter what your situation is like no matter the state of your finances or
relationships no matter the state of your health or the demands on your time
and attention this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you if you
but hold on to it no matter how much or
how little you have no matter your state of mind or how you feel this power to be
good and kind can never be taken from you if you hold on to it no matter what
your country's social political or economic situation is like and how it
affects you this power to be good and kind can never be taken from you you
hold on to it by understanding that this is your innate nature that's why it
feels so good because it's your default State this is how you came into the
world and how you may have spent the first years of your life until you grew older and forgot your true nature
you are not your gender nor your sexuality nor your job nor your economic status nor your nationality or political
affiliation you are yourself a being filled with love with light with peace
and joy you are a person who seeks
happiness and miracles and wants it for others as well because you know that
this is the default State for everyone your pain is the result of knowing this
truth but seeing another that's why you
come alive when someone shows you kindness because it reminds you of their
innate nature and that's why you feel powerful and validated when you show
kindness to another because it is a reminder of your own innate nature you
may not be the CEO of a major company or the ruler of a powerful country but you
have a power similar to theirs the power to change the lives of others and it
begins with one thought that I am good and therefore have the power to
demonstrate the goodness or to withhold it it begins with one act the power to
sit or stand up straight and undefeated confident in understanding of your own
innate goodness finally it projects itself with one
simple but sincere smile one that makes you feel good and because you feel good
you pass that feeling on to another changing another's day for the better by
making them feel the same and when another person feels good they
pass on that feeling on to another who passes it on to another and so on
continuing a chain reaction that began with you so you do have a tremendous
power one that could potentially affect millions and indeed change the world for
the better knowing this you cannot possibly be as
helpless or as powerless as you have let yourself believe understanding this you
can live each day with an upright posture a kind smile upon your face and
creating miracles there are millions out there whose dahi depends on you and
because their day depends on you so do their lives and the lives of others let
go of your limitations and accept your own power and responsibility to shape
the world into a better and more positive place it first begins with you
rest well my friend rest well and go out
create miracles change your life and at the same time changing the lives of
others [Music]
