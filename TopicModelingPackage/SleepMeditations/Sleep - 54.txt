it's time to let go we seem to spend a lot of time in our minds thinking about
past events worrying about the future and oftentimes these intensify just as
we rest our heads on our pillow to go to sleep let's now release this if you catch
yourself worrying thinking thoughts that don't serve you for this moment
simply bring your attention without any fanfare or concern back to your
breathing or back to focusing on this meditation and this is your meditation
you create your own rules with this meditation and your rules may change
each time you listen to this meditation recording taking in three deep breaths
in through the nose and out through your mouth
releasing concerns thoughts of the day worries just letting them all go and
they had just pass a byes they aren't you they come into your consciousness
and you allow them to float on by once
you've done this go back to your breathing regular breathing whatever is
comfortable for you just with an easiness [Music]
allow yourself to drift at any time into whatever realm of
consciousness you choose [Music]
see yourself now entering into the deep dense Amazon rainforest over two million
miles of lush greenery rainforest that is filled with hundreds of billions of
individual trees although somewhat dark
up ahead you see the sun shining peering
through trying with all its might to come into full being in this majestical
place be with the sounds of the forest
for a moment and hear the abundance of insects birds and animals and even the
plants seem to add their own gentle vibrations to this enormous space
breathe into this become one with this
as you breathe the forest breathes with you if during this time your mind
wanders and you become aware of this just gently shift it back to the sounds
of this amazing environment or refocus on your breathing in and out moment by
moment breath by breath
[Music]
[Music]
moving deeper into the forest now you are comfortable releasing and letting go
of that which no longer serves you and you feel lighter
what do you see hear or smell what
sounds you walk on the dab leaves as they squish under your feet you continue
walking step by step sensing and moving closer towards the Sun that continues to
try to break through the forest canopy
a gentle light rain begins to fall down
you find a comfortable place to be and allow the raindrops to comfort you feel
this rain fall on your skin it relieves you from the humidity refreshing you and
seems to wash away your past setting you free if only for the next few moments from
all past worries and concerns this is
your time right now
if repetitive thoughts continue within your mind acknowledge them and let them
know that you will deal with them later right now this is your time to sleep
relax let go and surrender
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
the rain eases and you begin to move on not too far up ahead you see before you
a stupendous sized broadleaf tree it seems to stand out from all the others
it has enormous vines twisting and turning winding its way up the mammoth
girth of this powerful specimen of a tree you are drawn to it as if by some
sort of magnetic force it's calling you almost like it has something important
to share with you you move closer
you're standing there before it now it
seems to know you like much of the Amazonian plant medicine surrounding you
this enormous tree senses your trials and tribulations of late it even knows
of deep pain that you may not even be consciously aware of at this point in time and so it invites you to wrap your
arms around the base of the tree and so you do feel its strength feel how
powerful this living being is and it is a being it's alive breathing and
epitomizes strength
smell the earthly scent of the trunk as your face presses up against it smell
the leaves surrounding it in the damp ground
as you continue to connect on a deeper level with this tree you feel a powerful
surge run through you enveloping you
comforting you healing you
