peaceful healing night sleep now I invite you to make yourself
comfortable take a moment and make sure

you to have the sense of safety and ease in your mind and body so you can fully
relax pause the recording if you need to
make any further adjustments bring your
attention now to your breath notice your
natural breath rhythm and depth and now
I invite you to breathe in deeply through your nose counting the length of your inhale pause
for a moment once you have fully inhaled then exhale
for the same count as your inhale
[Music] continue breathing deeply for a few
cycles while observing and counting your breath creating an equal breath pattern
connecting with the balance of your inhale and your exhale
[Music]

your breath return to its natural rhythm and flow perhaps noticing that your
breath is continuing to remain balanced

noticing of your experience without judgment [Music]

if you can do this with as little effort as possible [Music]
do your best to let go of any expectations of what you think you might
sense and simply feel what is there
without judgment [Music]
