hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this bedtime meditation
designed to promote more peaceful and soothing dreams
whether you have experienced difficult dreams lately or an absence of dreams
this meditation will help to set the stage for beautiful imagery to visit you
as you sleep while listening to this meditation
simply allow your body to rest and your mind to expand as you drift into
beautiful places using the power of your attention
so now I asked you to take a few deep breaths opening yourself to this
powerful practice of visualization
before we set the stage for better dreams to come to you let's take a
journey into the body and mind exactly as it is now to prepare I invite you to
make yourself entirely comfortable lie down in any position that is comfortable
to you however you rest remain mindful of keeping the neck in line with the
spine to help promote a sense of openness and relaxation within the body
proper posture even when sleeping helps to promote positive feelings that will
carry over into sleep making any final
adjustments necessary just allow yourself to come into a state of
complete stillness the only observable
movement now should be the breath as it makes its way through the body opening
the chest and expanding the belly
as you witness your body coming into stillness notice how the breath naturally slows
itself
you might even allow a deep sigh of relief to leave the body on an
exhalation releasing any unnecessary tension or concern that lingers in your
body
begin to open your senses up to the world around you beginning with your
ears start to become mindful of the quiet space that is around you and of
any sounds that pass through this sense of stillness
when opening the ears there is no need to search for noises or to label any
sounds that arise simply observe whatever is going on around you through
your sense of hearing [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
become aware now of the physical space you reside in noticing the sensations of
the surface beneath you of any cushions or blankets above or against you notice
if there is any particular sensation of the air around you does it appear to be
still or in flow is it cool warm or
possibly neutral [Music]
just allow your physical body and its capacity to feel the ground you deeper
into this present moment [Music]
[Music]
I invite you now to move a little further into the body following the
movement of air into your lungs tune in
to the sensations of it as it enters and leaves you as the belly rises and as it
falls [Music]
without attempting to change the breath in any way allow it to carry you further
into the experience of inner stillness even amidst its constant flow
allow the physical body to settle reaching a point of complete ease and
comfort if you feel is necessary to
adjust your position in any way just move slowly and mindfully as you come
into a place of deeper comfort [Music]
take a moment now to observe the mind you might find that thoughts and
associated feelings linger beneath the surface of an otherwise very still state
if thoughts are present simply observe
them from a place of compassion and non judgment just see if it's possible to
observe them as an outsider without becoming consumed by the stories they
tell and then return your attention to the breath
[Music] at any point you can use the breath as a
tool to draw you back into a present state of awareness
when we draw our attention to the mind during meditation we might find that
enchanting visuals accompany the stories we tell the point of this meditation is
not to banish or look down upon this imagery that we create unconsciously
meditation is simply a call to become more conscious and mindful of what is
happening inside of our heads the mind
is a powerful tool that can either entrap us in imagery informed by fear or
that can be used to enhance our lives and create more positive beliefs ideas
and dreams take a few moments now to
practice being an outside observer of thoughts and imagery that appear in the
mind simply become more attuned to the way that your thoughts give life to your
visions knowing that you hold the power to turn your attention away from any
storyline that is guided by fear worry or anxiety
[Music]
rather than force your thoughts to become something you might deem to be more positive take this time to let all
thoughts dissolve continue to focus on the breath moving through you as you
sink further and further away from mental distractions
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
with each inhalation you might envision yourself being infiltrated with
lightness peace and contentment and with
each outward breath you can imagine that all negative and unconstructive thoughts
and beliefs are being released allow
yourself to become completely at ease within this present moment
take another moment to feel into your physical body knowing that you are
entirely supported in this moment physically emotionally and spiritually
and that even through this simple act of slowing down you are beginning to invite
more positive dreams into your evening sleep [Music]
from this deep sense of underlying stillness I invite you now to use the
power of your mind to enter a visual place of peace beauty and serenity there
are no rules as to what this place should look like so long as it brings
you a sense of inner peace the place you
choose might be a beach a mountain range a lake or somewhere further afield
perhaps somewhere far into outer space this is your vision take a few moments
now to settle on your preferred location allowing it to enliven itself in your
mind's eye [Music]
[Music]
commit your awareness to building this peaceful space in your mind allow it to
expand naturally alongside your growing sense of inner tranquility build it
using the blessing of all of your five senses tune into your sense of sight
first allowing your visual sense to build this place of your truest dreams
[Music] what colors and textures are present to
the eyes other animals plants or other
humans around you here
[Music] what does the sky look like from where
you look out what elements are present
simply tuned into the visual presence of fire earth water and air if any or all
of these are present
allow your creation of this space to include your sense of sound is it
completely silent where you are or are there subtle noises present possibly
there's a recognizable beat or rhythm in any sounds that might be growing in this
space or are the sounds disorderly like
the unpredictable pitter-patter of rain [Music]
simply allow that whatever brings you peace to arise in this place of beauty
[Music]
[Music]
tuning in now to your sense of smell are there any recognizable aromas that are
present here from the smell of salty
water to fresh earth and autumn leaves allow nature's aromas to trickle into
this imagery you are resting within and if nothing arises that is fine too there
are no rules to what your mind creates so long as it brings you comfort
[Music]
consider your sense of taste now allowing your experience here to delight
your taste buds as you explore this
peaceful landscape is there anything that you feel compelled to taste you
might want to indulge in wild berries in pure spring water or in some of a
worldly treat born in outer space just
allow your experience to be rich divine and fulfilling nourishing your entire
being [Music]
and as you explore this place either walking slowly through it or from a
resting position allow yourself to feel into it through your physical body
what nourishing surfaces does your body come into contact with
[Music] how does the air feel against your skin
[Music] thus the Sun or moon beam down on you
filling you with a sense of ease and enchantment just allow whatever brings
you deep peace to express itself here
[Music] now I invite you now to tune into this
place you have created with a sixth sense that is with your hearts feeling
as you breathe and vision your heart
expanding with each inhalation and softening with each exhalation
with each breath allow your heart to open up to the piece you have just built
within you let this space nourish your
innermost being Oh heartedly
take a few more moments to allow yourself to play rest or recharge in
this beautiful and tranquil environment you have conjured use each of your
senses including your heart to explore
this moment as fully as possible
[Music]
in this very moment you feel a deep sense of care love and support granted
to you by the universe by the beautiful space you have created and by your
highest self and clearest mind [Music]
everything in this space and time is exactly as it is meant to be and you
feel highly attuned with all that is around you [Music]
slowly I invite you now to gently release the imagery you have created
letting go of the taste and texture and the sights and sounds
[Music]
gently release your vision of this beautiful place knowing that in some way
on some other fjord of reality it is
still very present within you [Music]
even as the images fade away you maintain the heartfelt sensations this
visualization opened you up to inside of you there is a deep sense of peace
beauty and contentment
[Music] come back now to the breath watching it
flow gently and steadily through you
[Music] as you return to this physical reality
that you are in you begin to feel more grounded and present within your
environment there is a deeper sense of
that inner stillness you know is always within you so take a moment to draw your
awareness through the body blessing the entirety of your physical being with
deep rest and relaxation release any
constriction in the belly the chest area
soften and loosen
the jaw release
[Music] and your phorid
allow the entire body to relax completely as you prepare to enter the
dream world [Music]
as you settle into a state very close to
sleep little pieces of your peaceful paradise linger in the back of your mind
unconsciously through the power of this
visualization you have set the stage for beautiful dreams to carry you through
the night ahead all tension worry and
fear have melted away and in its place nothing but lightness and peace remains
allow your breath to continue rocking you to sleep alongside each breath cycle
you might silently repeat this following affirmation until slowly this awakens
state drifts the way my dreams are
filled with beautiful visions my dreams
are filled with beautiful visions my
dreams are filled with beautiful visions
keep your heart and mind wide open your
body rooted in a sense of inner peace and harmony and allow the infinite
possibilities for beauty to infiltrate your dreams continue whispering silently
my dreams are filled with beautiful visions my dreams are filled with
[Music] beautiful visions until this wish
becomes a slumbering reality
