hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided nighttime
meditation that is aimed to help you wind down both body and mind
before sleep often times we get into bed with our heart set on getting a great
night's sleep an overactive body or mind or both stand in the way of our
achieving this deep relaxation that we yearned for so to address this challenge
this meditation will help you to soften all of that interactivity and tension as
you find yourself drifting naturally and gracefully into a sound sleep so before
we begin I invite you to take a moment or two to ensure that all of your end-of-day activities are taken care of
lights turned off alarms set if needed and anything else that might stand in
the way of your fullest relaxation you can address this
[Music] and once everything is taken care of
just getting comfortable in your sleeping or lying down position your
neck should be aligned with the spine and your arms and legs are free to fall and rest where they may and take a deep
breath in now and out and allowing
yourself to surrender a little bit into the surface beneath you take a moment
here to simply acknowledge the present state of your mind [Music]
without judging or evaluating or trying to change anything see if you might
observe whatever thoughts or feelings are present from a place of subtle
separation
[Music] it doesn't need to be any attachment to whatever you were witnessing just a soft
and compassionate acknowledgement of your present state of being
[Music]
now softly surrender is focused awareness as you shift your attention to
the natural rhythm of your breath [Music]
see if you can follow each inhalation and exhalation and mindfully observing
whatever sensations are present you
might notice the depth of your breath and its speed or rhythm
[Music] but in any case see if you can accept
your current state of being without trying to change it in any way
[Music]
and as you observe your breath you might notice it beginning to deepen
and quite often when we draw our attention in a loving and non-judgmental
way to the breath it begins to expand on its own you might observe the belly
softening or the shoulders falling whatever your experience feels like is
entirely welcome
[Music]
whether we are consciously aware of it or not our body and mind is connected so
when there is tension in either body or mind it often impacts the well-being of
the other aspect of ourselves sometimes we're not entirely aware of the tension
we hold on to until we start to consciously release it so what we are
going to do is we're going to move through a gentle though powerful practice of tension and release as you
hear each body part mentioned I invite you to bring attention or tightness to
this region and then to release it completely on your following breath out
so to begin draw your attention down to your feet on your next in-breath curling
them in and holding them tightly for a brief moment and on your next exhalation
release this tension completely [Music]
breathe slowly and mindfully in between body parts noticing the wave of
relaxation that pervades the mind as we move through this practice
now bring a tightness to both legs pulling them in and holding them just
for a moment and release them on the
exhalation perhaps relaxing more thoroughly through a deep sigh
[Music]
on your next breath in contract the space within your pelvis region and your
backside holding for just a brief moment
and then soften these areas on your exhalation and melting further into the
surface that support you [Music]
shifting your focus now up to your belly tightening your core muscles on your
next inhalation Titan and as you exhale
allow all the muscles here to relax completely feel a complete surrender in
your core taking a few slow deep breaths into your belly now
[Music]
draw your attention now to your hands tightening them into fists on your next
inhalation tighten and as you exhale
allow your fingers and palms to soften completely
[Music] on your next inhalation pull your arms
into your sides squeezing and holding for just a moment and as you exhale
allow them to surrender completely to gravity [Music]
bring a subtle and inward pull to your shoulders and upper chest area on your
next inhalation and tighten and relax
these areas completely allowing the shoulders to fall back and the hard area
to soften and expand [Music]
now I invite you to focus on the muscles in your face tightening your jaw your
cheeks your forehead but just a moment really tense really tighten and as you
exhale allow all face muscles to soften completely let go
[Music]
lastly I invite you to tense your entire body or any particular region that you
feel requires further release and hold here for just a moment as you observe
the sensation of tension here on your
next outward breath let the entire physical body go letting gravity nourish
you as it holds you safely and comfortably on the bed or other service
that supports you here [Music]
just take a few moments of silence here to ground yourself through the breath once again subtly observing the
underlying restful state of both body and mind
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
if it feels more comfortable to sink into sleep in a different position you're welcome to shift your posture at
any time and if or as you move positions
just move slowly and mindfully embodying this peaceful state of being that you
have transitioned into [Music]
if any thoughts arise in the forefront of your mind attempting to pull you away from this
inner peace continue observing these invisible movements of energy by
silently whispering to yourself I see you and I release you I see you and I
release you I see you and I release you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now allowing all thoughts to be gently surrendered as they arise see if he can
tune into the blank canvas that exists before the mind's eye and in this space
begin to visualize yourself standing at the edge of a majestic lake the ancient
pines that surround the shore the clouds that fill the sky and the subtle stars
that begin to appear overhead as the night approaches
[Music] each of these elements adds to the
wonder of this space you are witnessing
[Music] the waters are calm and clear mirroring
the pink orange and fading blue sky above [Music]
you feel equally peaceful silently
whispering the beauty and radiance of this simple moment
[Music]
you stand firmly grounded on a rocky peninsula that slopes gently towards the
water barefoot you feel into the cool
rock beneath you kneeling deeply connected to and supported by the
physical earth this connection you now
hold with nature inspires you to seek more of this natural comfort in your
waking life to return to this natural
place whenever you seek clarity peace or
release
just to your right a narrow dark extends from the shore at the end of it a
floating raft gently bobbles atop the still water
[Music] as the Sun sets we begin to feel tired
hoping to drift off beneath the stars that grow brighter and brighter as the
sky darkens so you begin to slowly and
mindfully make your way down the dock soon coming to reach the raft that
floats at the end of it [Music]
upon reaching the raft you notice that there are already cushions and blankets
set up for you making yourself comfortable you come to
rest here lying down gently beneath the stars overhead a gentle lapping of water
beneath the raft lulls you closer and closer toward sleep
[Music]
as you listen to it the mind begins to fall away and your inner peace rises to
the surface [Music]
before drifting off however you take one long last look up towards the cosmos
witnessing the stars here surrounded by the beauty and peace of this natural
landscape it is enough to melt all worries and fears away
[Music] all tensions are released from both body
and mind as you develop a deep trust in the grander vision of life the Stars
offer you this heightened perspective [Music]
you close your eyes on even the stars now tuning into the sound and sensations
observed here the water continues to lap
beneath the raft and the subtle rocking makes you feel deeply connected to the
water beneath you to the flow of life itself and to this unique and wonderful
journey you are honored
[Music]
[Music] you return to your breath now witnessing
the natural ebb and flow of this life force as it passes through your physical
being [Music]
on your next in breath just allow the heart and belly to expand completely and
as you breathe out release any last traces of tension perhaps with a deep
sigh to help you settle
[Music] now gently allow the notion of this
majestic lake to dissipate as you tune into your physical presence wherever you
are
notice the comfort and support of the surface beneath you the nourishment of
the breath as it flows through you and the piece that is observable beneath
the layers of your mind [Music]
[Music] with nothing left to envision and nothing left to do you are ready to let
the day come to an end so that another may arrive when you were well-rested
letting everything go gently allow yourself to drift into a deep and steady
slumber as you fall to sleep allow the
following affirmations to fill your subconscious mind continuing to
transform the inner world in positive and empowering ways
