hello this is Sara Raymond with the mindful movement welcome to this guided
sleep meditation to help you prepare for a deep and relaxing night's sleep we
will also focus on inviting in abundance to your life first I will guide you
through a complete body and mind relaxation that will bring about a sense of calmness and allow your subconscious
mind to let go of anything blocking the flow of abundance to you then you will
hear suggestions to invite abundance into your life in any way that you desire the mindset of abundance is the
opposite of scarcity abundance is the overflowing and over sufficient quantity
of that which you desire and you have the power to invite it into your life
what you are thinking about right before you fall asleep will set the tone for
the quality of your sleep and your mindset for the next day you have the choice to change the way
that you look at things before we get started make sure you are ready to drift
off to sleep if you like when this recording is over if you like the relaxing benefits of lavender oil and
happen to have some you can rub some on your temples or your pulse points or
perhaps diffuse it into the air or spray a light mist on your pillow
make your environment as dark and relaxing as possible take a moment now
to turn off all distractions and pause this recording if there's anything you
need to prepare yourself for a safe and comfortable night's sleep
know that you are safe and supported and you can awake from the state of relaxation at any time if you choose to
do so
now that you have prepared your surroundings welcome a sense of
relaxation and peace into your mind and body
invite it in as if you are welcoming an old friend
as we begin allow your eyes to close gently and focus your attention on your
breath by simply being mindful and
intentional with your breath your body sends a signal to your brain that you
are safe and can move into rest and digest mode
now begin to deepen your breath take a
full breath in to fill up from your belly up to your ribs and into your
chest and hold your breath for just a moment [Music]
and let out your breath gently allowing any physical and emotional tension to
leave your body with your exhale again
take another deep breath hold it for a
short moment and this time take your time with the exhale slowing it down so
that it lasts just a little longer than the inhale
take the next few moments to mindfully breathe in this way encouraging each
exhale to be just a bit longer than the inhale to signal the body to relax
each breath cycle allow the exhale to slow down a little more than the breath
before it and feel your body soften
and your thoughts slow down even more with each slow deep breath
now release that breath pattern and allow your breath to return to its
natural rhythm and flow
notice how you were feeling while you're short and focused breath
practice has slowed your heart rate it has quieted your mind it has brought
about a heavy sense of calm to your physical body
[Music]
notice the natural rhythm of your breath and feel the sensations that accompany
your breath
perhaps you feel a slightly cool sensation as the air passes through your
nostrils
maybe you feel a floating sensation as your abdomen and chest rise and fill
with breath
or a heaviness as the air moves out of your body taking any tension with it
maybe the breath brings a warming sensation to the body as it travels along its path
whatever you're feeling is perfect simply observe the process
this process of relaxation is not about what you are feeling
but that you are being curious and looking
[Music] as you continue to attend to the
sensations in the body associated with your breath let go of distractions let
go of your responsibilities let go of expectations of what you think
this experience should be and surrender to the process of relaxation
simply notice what you are feeling without changing or judging just notice
invite in the feeling of peace as you tune out the whole world around you and
go within with my voice as a soothing guide to help you move towards sleep
in a moment now I will guide you to slowly scan your entire body starting
from the top of your head moving all the way down through your feet
as I say each part of your body see that
part in your mind's eye and you can relax that body part completely
[Music] welcome the sense of ease through your entire body and mind
encourage the weight of your body to be completely supported by the surface
below you so that there is no need to hold on you can simply let go into sleep
there is no need to follow my voice for the entire recording
your subconscious mind will hear me as you drift into sleep
now as we begin to scan the body bring your attention to the top of your head
intend to feel this area from the inside of your body as sensations only
without moving your eyes as you scan your body simply move your awareness to
each part and you will relax that body part completely
let's begin this relaxation process with the scalp
welcoming ease into the forehead and eyes
allow the release of any facial expression to soften the lines of your
face relax the tiny muscles around your
eyes and feel as your eyelids become heavy
allow your cheeks to soften your jaw to unclench and your neck to relax
completely
as each muscle relaxants in progression it invites a deeper sense of relaxation
to the parts of your body that came before in our body scan
continuing this cumulative relaxation process as you invite a sense of peace
and stillness to your shoulders chest and arms
perhaps feeling a relaxed heaviness move into your ribs abdomen and back
let go of any gripping in your hips as your thighs rest heavy on the surface
below you as if there is no difference between where you end and where the
surface below you begins
you may find that the simple act of paying attention to a specific body part
allows it to relax and let go
finally since your ankles and feet releasing and relaxing completely
[Music]
take another moment to slowly scan your body once more
this time notice any areas that may still be holding on to any lingering
tension and ask your body to let go
simply let go of the need to be in control and surrender to the support of
the surface below you
your body is safe and supported and knows exactly what to do to relax if
you simply allow the tension to release
now they were fully relaxed I will guide you on a journey this journey will take
you on a path to release any negative beliefs or ideas that could be holding
you back from the abundance you desire
then you will bring in the energy of abundance into the space you create for
it when you let go of fears
I invite you to open your imagination and step into a field of beautiful
wildflowers
look around at this field of wildflowers as you stand on a path that leads you
right down the center of the field here you are surrounded on both sides
by flowers and the most vivid colors
use your senses to take in this beautiful and peaceful environment around you
see the clear bright sky above you
feel that the temperature of the air is perfect just for you
and the Sun shines on you gently warming your skin
the faint smell of the flowers is just right for your liking
perhaps you hear birds chirping in the distance or see butterflies flitting
around
as you look around you can see many beautiful colors in all directions around you
you sense that you are safe and peaceful in this place in your imagination that
is just right for you
[Music] you begin to walk along this path down
the center of the field moving towards some rolling hills where you see even
more wildflowers
as you walk you have a feeling that you are carrying around something extra
something weighing you down something making you feel heavy and tired
you reach into your pockets and feel that surprisingly there are some smooth
stones there
these stones that you are carrying around weighing you down [Music]
represent your fears and your feelings of not enough
they represent anything known or unknown to you that is holding you back
each stone is something that is blocking the flow of abundance to you
slowly take one stone out of your pocket and leave it on the path behind you as
you continue walking forwards
feel that a space has opened up inside of you as you let go of something
negative in your life
there's no need to label what you are letting go of simply let go knowing that
it's something that no longer serves you or support your goals and desires for
abundance
continue to do the same with each of the remaining stones in your pocket one at a
time take your time and feel the
energetic shift from negative to positive
feel the space you have opened up for the flow of abundance
now that you have let go of that which no longer serves you you have made room
for the flow of abundance
invited in
letting go of resistance gives way to an attitude of allowing allow in positive
energy thoughts and beliefs
allow in gratitude love and abundance
feel this flow of positive energy within you
and it is magnetically attracted back to you
take a moment and sense this energy and positive feeling
[Music] as you look around at the field of
flowers now you can see possibilities and abundance everywhere you look
each of the flowers around you grow from a seed each seed had everything it
needed within it to become the flower that it is and each flower has the seeds
to become many more flowers and on and on the cycle goes
much like these flowers grown from seeds you to have everything you need within
you to have the life of your dreams and to attract the abundance in your life
that you desire
the abundance of the flowers around you represents abundance in your life now
call to mind a part of your life that you would like to see a flow of
abundance visualize this component of
your life exactly as you want it to be
feel how it would feel as if this was already true for you soak in the
feelings in this present moment
the things you think about right before drifting off to sleep color your thoughts as you sleep and for the day
ahead in a moment I will guide your subconscious with some positive
affirmation statements inviting the flow of abundance into your life there is no
need to repeat these if you are so relaxed you are almost sleeping your
subconscious will hear them simply believe they are true
I acknowledge the positive things in my life
I expressed the feeling of gratitude often for the blessings in my life
I love myself and believe I am worthy of abundance to flow to me
I allow the flow of abundance in all aspects of my life
I attract success and abundance
I radiate out positive loving energy and that is what comes back to me
I take action towards my goals of abundance every day
I let go of negative influences and energies that do not serve me
I know that abundance is unlimited and that my abundance will benefit others
I am generous and give my unique gifts to the world
and now you have prepared your mind in your body for a deep and restful night's
sleep your subconscious mind is open to allow
the flow of abundance to you
you're a relaxed and feel a sense of lightness and spaciousness as you have
let go of anything weighing you down
sleep is inviting you to let go and surrender to your dreams
allow this to happen if you wish take the final steps into a deep and
restful slumber
as you drift off into a dreaming sleep you will continue to radiate out love
and positive energy and attract it back
to you
your body knows exactly what to do to relax
and allow abundance during your very productive deep sleep
as you drift off into serene peaceful rest my voice will gradually disappear
and you will be deeply asleep
and when you awake hours later you will feel energized rejuvenated
and you will be open to allow the flow of abundance to you
