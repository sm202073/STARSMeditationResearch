hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this guided bedtime
meditation that will help you to fall asleep quickly and soundly over the
course of this meditation you will move deeper and deeper into a state of
relaxation releasing all physical tension before being guided into a
beautiful visualization that will enhance your inner sense of peace and tranquility
there is nothing required for you to actively do here you are simply invited
to open your mind as you are guided naturally towards a peaceful slumber
before you settle into the space you're in take a moment to ensure that your
blinds are drawn and your morning alarm is set when you're ready to put the day
behind you and sure you're in a comfortable lying down position as you prepare for complete release and
relaxation use any blankets and cushions to support yourself as necessary and
when you are in utmost comfort take a few slow and grounding breaths to
connect with this moment in space and time
[Music]
the breath is a gateway into the present moment and into deep release and greater
alignment though this invisible life forced often goes overlooked it is one
of the most powerful tools of relaxation available to us in any given moment so
take this opportunity now to witness the breath to simply observe its depth and
rhythm allowing it to deepen as you naturally ease your way into this period
of darkness draw your attention to the
stomach noticing the way the breath follows suit as we consciously welcome
our breath into the belly we initiate the body's relaxation response lowering
stress hormones blood pressure muscle tension and our breathing rate
inhale all the way into the base of the spine and then exhale completely
softening all muscles as you surrender a little bit further
now I invite you to introduce small pauses between inhalation and exhalation
resting in complete stillness for just a moment after each in-breath and each out
breath
so it's going to be inhale to a count of four pause for a brief moment and then
exhale completely for a count of four pausing for just a moment of complete
stillness once again witness the body
relaxing more fully as you breathe in the slow and steady way for three more
rounds on your own now
[Music]
gently release your attention from the breath now tuning into the visceral
sensations of the body hold the entire
body in your awareness for a few moments noticing if there's any physical tension
or contraction present if you come
across any area in need of love and release just gently draw your breath
towards this region on your next inhalation inviting nourishing light to
support your full release and as you
exhale allow all tightness and all tension to dissipate feeling yourself
sink more completely into the surface beneath you
as you welcome release into the physical body through your breath the mind
naturally follows suit moving into greater peace and harmony so
follow my voice as you are guided through the body using the power of your
attention to grant full release begin by
a breathing loving-kindness into the feet area releasing any heaviness that
may be stored here
breathe into the legs now thanking these limbs for carrying you throughout your
day and then allowing them to relax completely into this moment
[Music] inhale deeply now into the hips and
pelvis softening and releasing on the exhalation
and then move to the belly allowing your core muscles to relax and the breath to
flow effortlessly into this area of the body
[Music]
hope in your heart and chest now as you breathe nourishing lifeforce
into this center of your pain softening on the exhale
[Music]
soften your hands allowing them to sink into the surface beneath you and then
grant the same release to your arms just letting them melt away for the night
soften your shoulders your neck region
your jaw
your cheeks and nose
and your eyes
take a moment to soften the eyebrows in the forward just allowing all mental
tension to dissipate as you release all muscles surrounding your thinking mind
hold your entire body in your awareness now allowing it to be completely at
peace in this present moment return to
your breath for a couple more cycles noticing once again the short pauses in
between each in-breath and each out breath
now feeling physically relaxed and in alignment with this present moment I
invite you to tune in to the mind's eye without force or strain allow the
following visualization to conjure images of deep peace and tranquility as
you move gracefully into a deep slumber for the night in your open field of
vision now begin to visualize you're on a tropical island feet firmly grounded
into the warm crystals of sand that stretch out to either side of you where
you rest the waters are shallow off the coast lending themselves to crystal
clear turquoise hues and the most beautiful waters you have ever laid eyes
on
the salty breeze infiltrates your nostrils and you exhale deeply feeling
yourself sink further into this paradise island that warms both body and soul
you take a few steps forward slowly eventually coming to dip your toes in
the warm yet refreshing waters that surround this small Paradise Island
standing at a balance point between ocean and earth ankle deep in those
turquoise waters inner peace flows through you as you come to realize you
are whole and complete just as you are
you yearn to dive into the healing salty waters before you and so prepare
yourself for this descent when you are
ready you begin to walk slowly and mindfully away from the steady Shore
step by step until soon your lower legs are submerged you continue walking
slowly and with grace until soon you are
waist-deep in these cleansing waters you
pause here tracing the surface of the ocean with your fingertips and when you
are ready you reach your arms ahead of you as you shallow dive into the crystal
clarity that now bathes your entire body
as each crystal bead of ocean rushes along your skin you feel restored and
renewed
turning onto your back you allow your body to float on the still surface the
ocean is calm and quiet nestling you
continually into a peaceful state that lives both within and around you the
salt water cleanses your skin rejuvenating your physical body
energetically it penetrates deeper healing and nourishing your spiritual
and emotional bodies all trapped emotions and all old energy systems are
absorbed by the healing potential of these waters this process of renewal
leaves you free to relax completely
floating here on the surface of the water you are in a state of complete
bliss
[Music] the mind softens entirely nothing
tethered to it any longer any thoughts
that do rise in your consciousness are released to the ocean as swiftly as they came you know that any thoughts or
emotions that arise do not belong to you there are simply bodies of energy coming
like waves before dissolving back into the wholeness of the ocean
[Music]
Aya's transfixed with the sky you notice the lighting and shade overhead is
shifting blue hues now blend into a subtle orange signifying that the Sun is
now setting behind the horizon you take
this as a cue to return to land turning back towards the beach and the canopy of
palm trees that overhang it
you return to your feet gliding out of the water slowly step by step
you finally come to reach land and find that a plush towel neatly folded on the
warm sand has been sent for you by the universe you wrap yourself in this warm
soothing towel and begin to walk slowly down the beach into the sunset
as you walk you open your senses to this environment
you notice the aroma of the salty air continually cleansing you with each
breath
you taste the salt on the outer edges of your lips left behind from your healing
dip in the ocean
you hear the gentle rustling of palm trees a subtle lapping of water against
the shore and the sound of release that comes with each deep exhale you make
tuning into your sense of touch you feel the warmth and comfort of the towel
against your skin as well as the sweetness of sand beneath your feet
staring ahead you see the crest of beautiful palm trees the white sand
slowly becoming darker as night approaches and the vibrant sky now
orange and magenta as the Sun has disappeared behind the horizon just a
dozen yards ahead of you firmly grounded in the shallow waters by sturdy stilts
you see an overwater bungalow connected to the shore by a long wooden dock this
is your own private Cabana where you will sleep the night away in tranquillity step-by-step continuing to
move slowly and mindfully you make your way back to the dock you arrive at the
foot of it and see that string lights lie in both railings
as you make your way towards your private bungalow by ferry light you feel
the day behind you dissipating naturally you reach the end
of the dock arriving at the door of your Cabana turning the handle you make your
way inside and admire the beautiful warm interiors that nourish mind body and
spirit a large glass window who
reacquaint you with the Sun when it rises and fresh fruits will energize
your body when morning arrives for now
you turn your full attention to the four-poster bed in the center of the
room a plush white quilt is draped over
top and white lace curtains pulled back and tied elegantly to each side
preparing a suffering deep slumber you climb inside this cozy and welcoming bed
ready to rest peacefully for the night so that you may wake inspired and
energized when morning comes notice the
comfort of the blankets and cushions that support you here notice the peace
and quiet that beckons you into a deep slumber
all you hear are the subtle sounds of the ocean and your own slow steady
breathing take a few last moments to
revel in this beauty of this setting soaking it up in spirit gently allow the
visuals to dissipate returning to your physical reality carrying the same peace
and stillness you've found there by the ocean you are safe and supported here
resting peacefully and soundly as you slowly slip into a deep slumber
as you drift off to sleep allow the
following affirmations to fill every cell of your being positively
transforming the world within [Music]
