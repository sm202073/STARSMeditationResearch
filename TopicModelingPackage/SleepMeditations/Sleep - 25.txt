hello my name is Jason Stevenson and welcome to this soothing guided
meditation that will take you on a journey into the peace of the ocean
gently guiding you towards a restorative and peaceful sleep during the course of
this journey you will first come into contact with the peace that exists right
here in the present moment before being guided to open yourself up to a deeper
descent underwater all that is required
of you now is a willingness to open yourself up to the possibility of
complete inner harmony take a few grounding breaths now as we
begin this exploration allowing your heart and chest to soften with each
breath that you take [Music]
now take a few moments to make any necessary adjustments to the physical
body moving yourself in such a way to allow relaxation to flow effortlessly
through your being if there is any tightness lingering around the chest or
the stomach or your shoulders or any
other part of your body quietly make note of this tension and then gently
release it on the next breath out [Music]
straighten your neck soften the area around your eyes as you consciously
begin to release all physical tension you prepare yourself for the journey
into deep release and peace
[Music] now before we journey anywhere let's
take some time to become more intimately aware of the environment around and within us begin by simply drawing your
awareness to the physical body and each area of it that is in contact with the
physical support beneath you you might notice the entire back side of your body
being completely supported by the bed or the cushions or the blankets underneath
you just take a moment to simply draw your attention to each area of contact
here
now consider areas of the body facing upwards towards the ceiling that are
also in contact with the material world noticing items of comfort that might be
draped over the top of you and then see
if you can finally tuned in to the invisibility of air that surrounds your
body noticing if you can feel it against your skin
in these observations there is no need to search for some specific form of
experience or result simply allow any arisings to be witnessed
[Music]
draw your attention now to the belly as you observe the way it rises and falls
as you inhale and exhale [Music]
even if sensations of the breath within a more subtle we can typically observe
their presence in the form of movement once we draw our attention to this life
force so allow the rest of the body to remain still as you focus for a few
silent moments on the rising and falling of your core
use your breath as an anchor when needed throughout this meditation even when you
descend into the depths of the ocean in this visualization the breath is always
available to provide you with grounding support and connection to this physical
existence and if at any point the mind
wanders becoming preoccupied with stories fears or judgments or chatter of
any sort you can once again turn to the breath or to my words to refocus your
attention it's entirely natural for our minds to wander so there is no need to
condemn this tendency in any way when distractions occur simply take a deep
breath refocus your attention and settle
into this act of self-care once again
as you watched the breath moving into and out of your body
allow a sense of tranquility to overcome your entire being of seemingly
paradoxical the breath is both like an anchor and like the waves they are one
in the same as we learn to ride the waves of breath and of life we move
towards the discovery of complete presence and stillness no matter how
still we bring ourselves to be waves will still come just as the breath will
still come movement is a part of life how we react to those movements is where
we discover our power to maneuver ourselves in this world peacefully and
calmly so before we descend into the
ocean take a few moments of silence to effortlessly move with the rhythm of
your breath the body will remain still while the present moment continually
shifts sink into this peaceful movement for a
short while now
[Music]
take this moment to tune into the space between the brows into the Mayans I
allow all thoughts and images to melt away as you focus your attention solely
on the empty space before you the world around and within becomes quiet as you
prepare for a journey into the depths of the ocean upon this blank slate before
your mind's eye begin to visualize yourself at the edge of the ocean your
bare feet are nestled into the sand as you stare out the vast sea before you
take a few moments to observe the sensations present what do your eyes
notice
you what sounds to your ears pickup
what smells fill the air
how does your body feel how does your heart feel
as you begin to relax into this space eel the ocean air filling the entire
cavity of your lungs as you inhale and then releasing all unnecessary stress
and tension from your physical body as you exhale stare out at the open sea as
you witness every knot and contraction dissolving
[Music]
you take a few steps forward so that as the waves brush up against the shore
they cover your feet observe the natural
rhythm of the waves steady though ever-changing just like the breath they
continue to flow in and out in
and out
the ocean slowly becomes influenced by your breaths natural rhythm slowly
coming to meet your own unique flow you
start to feel yourself to be in total harmony with the vast abyss in front of
you something inside of you whispers
view to venture into the water so you start to move slowly and gracefully
forward step by step you wade out until
soon your calves are submerged and then your knees
your thighs and your waist you stand
waist-deep as you prepare to dive below
[Music] stretching your arms out before you you take a deep breath a small jump and then
dive forward with grace and these you are now completely submerged as you
glide through the water extending both arm fords and then swooping them out to
the sides to propel you further you notice that by divine magic you are able
to breathe beneath the water small gills have developed and you come to realize
that you are neither of this world nor the human one you are otherworldly a
great wave of relief washes over you as you realize you had been yearning to
explore this underwater palace with ease
you continue to breast to stroke your way through the ocean feeling completely
safe and accepted within this new kingdom [Music] you absorb every new side every color
texture and shape of the sea life you pass
[Music] seahorses brightly striped fish and even
small shark swim around you none of them posing any threat to you in this magical
environment you breathe naturally and
effortlessly underwater your body feels light and free completely supported with
each and every movement you make with
every drop of water that soon passes over your body old stories and
detachments are released soon nothing
remains but a sense of oneness you are aligned with the oceans movements
gliding with grace
now something appears to be approaching you from straight ahead though you
cannot make out what the creature is your intuition tells you it is not
threatening the pair of eyes move closer and closer until very soon you know the
figure to be a dolphin that is making its way toward you the dolphin slows as
she approaches stilling herself just a few feet ahead of you
you too have ceased movement now floating effortlessly in the open abyss
of the great sea both pairs of eyes meet
as you take a few silent moments of pure awareness here you can sense that your
energies are in harmony and that you have attracted one another for a reason
[Music]
though the dolphin speaks a different language in sound the vibrations relay
her message she reminds you that it is possible to be both compassionate and
gentle while harnessing a deep and authentic source of inner strength when
embodying these two principles the way dolphins do body and mind relax
completely knowing that the paradoxes in life do not have to bring strife
strength and compassion can co-exist they can be one in the same
the dolphin breaks her gaze as she swims off to the side and begins to swim
playful circles around you she sings out to the sea reminding you
that it is okay to lighten up to play and to be who you really are as she
sings you feel her vibrations radiating into the core of your being in this
moment you know you are forever changed for the better balance and harmony have
now made their way into your burns rather than remaining an idea digested
by mind alone [Music]
the dolphin slows and comes back for one more brief moment to gaze into your eyes
a subtle smile overcomes her face before
she flutters away disappearing into the darkness ahead of you you breathe deeply
feeling her still very much present within you [Music]
she has blessed you with a wisdom and the gifts gifts that now live within you
you look above and notice you are not too far from the surface of the ocean
the sunlight trickles in to remind you to come back to the human world though
you have enjoyed your time in the depths of the ocean you know you must now
return as you swim slowly and calmly up towards
the light you feel every last grain of tension fall from your body sinking down
to the ocean floor to be renewed you
feel light and free having no remaining weightiness in your body or mind as you
break through the barrier of water that opens up to the open sky your gills
disappear and you notice what it is like to breathe like a human once again
floating on your back you take a few deep breaths into the belly feeling a
sense of calm filling you completely [Music]
visuals of the ocean begin to disappear from your mind's eye as you tune in once
again to the support and strength of the physical world beneath your body though
the ocean and a dolphin are now behind you they are forever within your heart
and spirit allow this earthly world to
support you once again the feeling of peace freedom and calmness that the
underwater world blessed you are still within you you will carry them into
sleep as you surrender effortlessly into the coming slumber
[Music] follow your breath acknowledging it to
be both wave and anchor as you melt into
this present moment completely welcoming another restorative night's sleep there
is nothing left to do but to grant your body in mind permission to release
themselves for another night follow your
breath now in silence allowing it to guide you into a deep and peaceful sleep
[Music]
welcome to this guided meditation which is designed to help you slow your racing
mind and then lead you gently into a soothing and restorative sleep over the
next little while I invite you to simply follow my voice as you come to
experience a profound sense of silence within take a few deep breaths now to
settle yourself into this space and soon and we will begin
it is not uncommon within our fast-paced modern lifestyle for the mine to be on
constant overdrive even when we bring
the body to rest mental chatter often persists one of the primary reasons that
we have trouble easing our way into sleep is because of this feverish side
of the mind whether it is caught up in the past events or is living 20 steps
into the future the mind has a way of pulling us out of the present moment it
keeps us stimulated and engaged even when we want to try to slow down when
the mind is constantly on the go deep rest is put on hold
before we begin navigating this side of the mind exposing it in such a way that
calms and soothes it let us take a few moments to come into a comfortable lying
down position and just taking your time to stretch and release the body in any
way that feels restorative and to adjust your positioning with cushions or
blankets as you require and once you are
settled see if it is possible to straighten the neck if it is curved at
all bringing a gentle oneness across the chest breathing in and exhaling
[Music] grounding yourself into the physical space beneath and around you so take
some time now to really connect with your breath becoming intimate with the
way it passes through you as you inhale
observe every sensation as the air trickles in first entering your nasal
cavity passing through the trachea and then settling into the depths of your
lungs and as you breathe out observe the
moment in Reverse as your breath returns to the world around you notice your
breaths rhythm and depth [Music]
without changing it in any way for the time being simply observe its flow
noticing where it extends to and how fast or slow it moves as we move through
this meditation remember that your breath is always available to help
anchor you in this present moment if distracting thoughts arise which they
will allow the breath to guide you back down to your body to your direct
experience of the now [Music]
take a moment now to simply draw your attention to your stomach notice the way
the belly moves as you breathe rising
and falling throughout the cycle of your breath as you draw your attention to
this area of the body you might notice that the breath naturally deepens
if so open yourself to this consciously
release any constriction in the abdomen to help guide the flow of air deep into
the belly [Music]
when how Mayans run uncontrollably our bodies assume a state of stress engaging
a defense mechanism known as the fight-or-flight response when the body
is engaged in this way the breath loses its depth hovering in the more shallow
cavities of the lungs hormone surge as
the body prepares to defend itself in
order to counterbalance this surge of stress hormones and to soften the
reaction within the body we can engage in what is known as the relaxation
response to help the body and mind to slow down by consciously drawing the
breath into the belly we invite this counter response to take over easing the
racing thoughts that stimulate the physical body
take a few moments of silence now to deepen the breath in this way guiding it
into the fullest capacity of the lungs so that it presses into the abdomen if
you find it challenging at first to deepen your breath all the way this is
entirely okay over time the breath will soften and the
lungs will expand for now just see how
far the breath is capable of going as you slowly breathe in and slowly breathe
out [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thoughts may continue to rise from time to time but there is no need to panic or
self judge if they do the mind may attempt to add fuel to the fire by
criticizing telling the self that it should not be thinking refrain from
giving in to this common reaction reminding yourself that is natural for
thoughts to arise and then compassionately releasing whatever has
come up
[Music]
[Music] thinking is a natural function of the mind and as such it cannot be forced to
cease entirely however we can begin to
expose our racing thoughts by observing them from a new place and with the fresh
lens as we uncover their nature we begin
to distance ourselves from them and from the stories that they spin so now I
invite you to open your heart to the truth that you are not your thoughts
take a few breaths here on your own repeating the following words in silence
I am NOT my thoughts I am NOT my
thoughts allow yourself to open
wholeheartedly to the truth that your thoughts do not define you
[Music]
[Music]
notice the way that the mind can be redirected in such a way flowing
alongside your attention it can take
time to catch the mind when it escapes but we continued practice it is possible
to refocus again and again on the direct
experience within this present moment any time the mind wanders simply
acknowledge its movement with compassion and curiosity there is no reason to
criticize or condemn the uprising of thought instead practice observing the
inner dialog from a distance when you
notice yourself becoming entangled in the minds story simply notice what has
happened and draw your attention back to your breath
[Music] continue to follow each inhale and each
exhale as you continually re-establish
yourself in the present moment [Music]
[Music] it is possible to further de-escalate
the power of your thoughts by beginning to label them whenever they arise this
sort of labeling should not be based in judgment such as being defined by words
such as good or bad or spiritual or an spiritual rather rising thoughts can be
observed according to the action that they represent for instance you may
assign certain words to your thoughts such as thinking planning denying
criticizing or worrying after you label
thoughts in this way allow the wave to disappear and then return to your breath
[Music]
practice this again rooting yourself through the breath and becoming more
aware of the nature of your thoughts not of their content witness the way they
move and the nature of these movements
[Music]
[Music]
other actions you might notice include hoping feeling dreaming and arguing
continue to quietly observe whatever arises coming back to your breath in
between rising thoughts
[Music]
you
you
you might also observe physical sensations labeling them as pressure
softness tingling or warmth continue to
notice whatever you notice allowing single words to disengage and trancing
stories
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] continue to come back to the natural
rhythm of your breath in between observations breathing in breathing out
continually refocusing your attention on this innate flow
now let whole words and thoughts subside as you come deeper into the physical
sensations of the body take a moment to
scan the body gently drawing your awareness first your toes before very
slowly moving upwards throughout the visceral body and as you pass each area
allow that part of the body to soften by
simply focusing on a particular area and by using the power of your attention to
release all of the associated muscles the physical body relaxes and the mind
relaxes even further alongside it
[Music] continue to work your way up slowly
releasing or constriction and tension that is held within the body breathe
into each body part blessing your physical being with love and compassion
[Music] when you reach the head area pay special
attention to the jaw to the eyebrows and
to the forehead allow each of these muscle groups to
relax observing the difference between felt contraction and release
now draw your attention now to the space between your brows to what is often
referred to as the third eye area and as
you hold your attention on this spot consciously keep the muscles around it
relaxed and breathe into this space for
just a few breaths noticing any sensations or visuals that might be
present
now gently envision a light blue glow
beginning to appear in this space it is soft and soothing gently pulsating in
this space between your eyebrows and as it expands it touches every cell
of the mind space dissolving all thoughts as it pulses
[Music]
you might notice yourself beginning to feel quiet tired finally feeling free of
your thought waves and feeling ready to relax deeply you might also like to feel
into this release through a deep sigh exhaling all tension out of the body
until nothing remains in your attention aside from this healing blue light
[Music] once all thoughts have been dissolved
this orb of energy begins to shrink but
not disappearing entirely now this soft
blue glow appears as a pearl pristine clear and sparkling it hovers in the
space between the brows for another moment and you come to witness a deep
and profound silence within its presence
sit with this silence for a few moments observing the peace and tranquility this
pearl of light has brought to your inner being
[Music]
[Music] the soft Paul begins to descend moving
very slowly until it reaches the throat and then
floating a little further still until it lands in the heart it pauses here
bringing its energy of stillness and tranquility to the heart space all is
silent now or has been brought to peace [Music]
[Music] the work of this blue light is now
complete and so very slowly it dissipates into nothingness you feel
complete serenity in this very moment knowing that you have been freed of all
racing thoughts the mind is at peace the
heart is at peace and your body is at
peace [Music]
continue to breathe as you begin your final descent into sleep allow the
natural rhythm of your breath the slow and steady waves of each cycle to gently
guide you into restorative slumber the
world within you and around you is quiet
any subtle sounds begin to fade away as
you slowly transition into a deep and peaceful sleep
inhale and exhale slowly deeply until
very soon this waking day has faded away
[Music]
[Music]
welcome to this guided morning meditation as you slowly awaken this
morning this meditation will gently guide you into a natural embrace of the
day ahead before we begin I invite you
to come into a comfortable position whether that sitting or lying down
ensure that the spine is straight your shoulders are relaxed
and the neck should be aligned with the spine all muscles gently relaxed so just
take a moment to adjust yourself in any way necessary just to ensure you are
comfortable and supported and when you
are ready allowing your eyes to gently close to begin this meditation simply
come to notice your breath without
trying to change it without judgment or assessment and you simply notice the
nature of it witness the way it effortlessly moves
into the body and then back out
[Music]
just become attuned to the natural flow of the breath as though observing the
breath the full length of each breath in and out
[Music]
[Music] as you begin to settle take a moment to
witness the entirety of your body and mind our thoughts often when we wake we
carry fragments of our dreams and we
hold on to thoughts about the days behind and the days ahead of us so
simply begin to observe from a place of non-attachment but ever you may be
carrying in the physical body [Music]
just gently witnessing any areas of tension or discomfort and invite your
breath to nurture these areas take a few
deep breaths into each area of the body calling for your attention and then
gently release them [Music]
allow your body to sink for a moment into complete stillness and silence
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
in the same way now draw your attention to anything arising in the mind now
there is no need to search for anything simply observe yourself open up to the
thoughts that may be pre-existing or as they make themselves known just witness
the nature of them and in the same way release them knowing that they are
simply intangible ideas about what has come or what may be to come as you do
this naturally notice yourself sinking further into this present moment sinking
deeply into this waking day [Music]
[Music]
whatever ideas you have about the day ahead I invite you to set them aside a
short while as you explore the moment you are presently in just notice through
the physical body the surface that support you the chair you are seated on
or the mattress you are lying on might be the floor quietly observe any sounds
or physical sensations around you both strong or subtle
[Music]
and through your closed eyes notice if there's any sense of sunlight trickling
in or shadows dancing behind your closed
eyes [Music]
as you come to mindfully explore the world around you there is silence and
stillness begin to make note of the presence of day just continue to allow
the breath to guide you through this gentle awakening of the senses noticing
how you are inextricably linked through the breath to the world outside of you
allow each in-breath to nourish you and
each breath out to free you of any
constriction fatigue or even thoughts that may be lingering
[Music] allow yourself to be nourished through
the breath as you open your heart to this new day
[Music]
I invite you now to draw your awareness
to your belly and as you do watch the
way the breath flows in through your chest filling the entirety of your lungs
and causes the stomach to expand to rise
and you might witness an expansion of the chest area as well an opening up of
the heart space [Music]
[Music]
if the mind wanders continue to simply invited back down and into the physical
body the day ahead will wait for now
simply embrace and enjoy these quiet moments of stillness presence and
awareness allowing yourself to tune into
the energy of a gentle a natural expansion that comes with sunrise
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now from this place of complete awareness and presence begin to tune
into the heart space drawing your awareness to the center of the chest and
allow your heart to expand
that has it expands envision it touching all possibilities for the day ahead
you might envision a white or a golden light radiating out from the heart
making contact with the future that is continually unfolding if you find any
anxious or fearful thoughts arise just
witness them without becoming attached to them and gently focus back into your
heart space or into the golden light radiating from this space within you
[Music] focusing now on your highest potential and visions for the day it might be
goals that you want to achieve things that you want to set out to do all you
need to do and allow any cluttering or limiting thoughts to naturally fall away
and there is no need to force anything out of existence or to judge or condemn
anything that might be arising if
anything less than your highest potential arises simply notice it
acknowledge it and allow it to dissipate
whatever we envision on a regular basis we start to manifest in the outer world
consciously reflect for a moment on whatever it is your highest self wishes
to manifest in your life or more specifically in the day ahead
what is the deepest yearning of your heart
[Music] what is the energy you wish to carry
with you throughout your day
continuing to feel into the hearts glow and compassionately allowing conflicting
mental chatter to subside as a higher truth reveals itself begin to narrow in
on what is it you wish to manifest considering for a moment that you
already hold whatever it is you may take
a few moments to breathe into this feeling as if it is already present
within you allow your thoughts to be
clear and conscious stemming from the core of who you are you might like to
consider in the words of Rumi what you seek is seeking you
[Music] just allow the openness of your heart to
hold the truth that whatever you hope to embody is already here it is already
present within you [Music]
[Music]
just coming back to the body now and taking in a few more grounding breaths
before setting a powerful intention for the day ahead allow yourself to be
completely here knowing that in truth
there is no where you need to go and nothing you need to achieve as we
increase our ability to be fully present you might find limiting thoughts begin
to fall away and you begin to embody more deeply the truth of who you are
take three silent and steady breaths here routing yourself in the expanding energy
of this morning
you
so from this place of pure presence I
invite you now to set one more clear and powerful intention for your day consider
whatever it is you wish to embody and state it to yourself as if it were
already here for instance if you are
longing is for self confidence and esteem consider a phrase such as I am
confident and complete or if the
stability and safety are of your highest concern perhaps an affirmation like all
of my deepest needs are being met
just allow yourself to become very clear and focused on your intention as you
begin to repeat it to yourself with each full breath so take a few moments of
silence here as you align your intention with your breath letting the words fill you up entirely
again and again but just a few moments
[Music]
[Music]
so wherever you are now resting come to notice once again with eyes closed
environment around you feel into the physical support of the ground beneath
you of the material world it has been
manifested around you [Music]
see if you can notice the air of the room that you are currently in and he
sounds near or far [Music]
and take three more full breaths here knowing that you are unconditionally
supported in this journey gently begin
to soften the area around the eyes and
when you are ready slowly open them up to the world around you noticing the
delicate transition from dark to light as you move forward in outward action
continually come back to the intention you are carrying within you knowing that
the universe is here to support guide and nourish you with every step that you
take [Music]
welcome to this guided meditation designed to help you ease into a deep
and peaceful sleep while lowering your blood pressure naturally and effectively
through mindfulness conscious breathing and deep body visualizations this
meditation will create an inner experience of relaxation as well as
guide the heart towards a healthy smooth and steady rhythm over the next short
while allow my voice to guide you into this deep state of relaxation knowing
that the hearts flow will follow suit as you sing further into stillness take
some time now to settle into a comfortable lying down position using
any blankets and cushions to support your body where needed
if possible on the spine and neck should be in line to help open the flow of
energy through the entire body
tune into your entire body now as you make any final adjustments that will
support your progression into a deeply relaxed and peaceful state I invite you
now to simply bring your attention to your breath
without trying to shift it in any way just gently open your awareness to it
observing its natural flow rhythm and depth
[Music]
[Music] notice the way the breath comes and goes on its own accord guided by an innate
wisdom that does not require any effort on your part it simply comes and goes
just as the ocean eps and flows
[Music]
[Music]
as you draw awareness to the breath notice if it naturally shifts in any way
again there is no need to intervene or manipulate its rhythm but you may find
that as you tune into the breath it might naturally deepen slow down or
adjust itself in some other way
just notice if this is true for you and also notice if it is not there is no
right or wrong way to notice the breath simply observe at however it comes and
follow it wherever it flows
[Music]
[Music]
throughout this meditation the mind may entangle itself in thoughts of the past
or in visions of what might come to be if for when it does simply acknowledge
this tendency as a movement away from this present moment before drawing your
attention back to the breath if thoughts
arise simply witness them for a moment with compassion and non judgment before
returning to your unchangeable center no
matter how frequently they crop up no that is entirely normal for thoughts
to rise and entirely possible to gently
let them go use the breath as your
anchor at any point during this meditation to reground yourself in the
physical place that you rest
you
[Music]
draw your awareness now to the stomach
noticing its natural rise and fall as breath moves through you
in our busy day to day activities we often breathe primarily from the
chest restricting our breaths range of movement this shallow breathing engages
our stress response and releases a surge of hormones that temporarily increase
our blood pressure as we naturally
expand the breaths movement moving it effortlessly into the stomach we
activate the relaxation response this
deeper breathing pauses out of an inner state of stress and helps us to sink
effortlessly into stillness and soon
into a state of deep sleep
continue to focus your attention on the stomach noticing just how far the breath
can go [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] take a moment now to acknowledge this
physical place you are in without
engaging the Mayans analytic capacity is
it possible to simply witness the space you occupy to witness the physical world
you are intimately connected to
[Music] notice the surface that supports you and
notice any soft textures around you [Music]
draw your awareness to this very simple moment knowing that there is nowhere
else you need to be you are nowhere else
but right here right now and all that is
asked of you is that you open your heart and awareness to this beautiful moment
before you fall into a deep and restorative sleep
[Music]
[Music]
as you notice your physical surrounds you may also become more deeply aware of
your physical body maintain awareness of
the breath flowing through you as you begin to scan the body gently starting
at the toes and traveling up to the crown of your head
[Music]
[Music] there is nothing you need to look for in this process he was simply called to
witness whatever exists within you
[Music]
if any tension or discomfort appears in your awareness
simply embrace it with your loving awareness and open your breath up to
this area that is calling for your tender love and air
[Music] if there are no strong sensations to notice simply grant your entire body
with your compassionate attention and let it melt further into stillness
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] feel entirely free to also make any physical adjustments to your positioning
that will help to provide you with more comfort if you adjust yourself at any
point during this meditation simply do so mindfully and slowly to help foster
this growing sense of peace and serenity
inhale as you make any movements and
exhale deeply as you settle into any new positioning
[Music]
[Music]
hold your physical body in your awareness now as you begin to envision
it's sinking deeper and deeper into the surface beneath you or tension is
invited to melt away and all muscles are
invited to relax completely with each
inhalation you are infused with the greatest sense of relaxation and with
each exhalation you release any lingering knots of tension or stress
[Music] just take a few deep breaths here
[Music]
envisioning this process that is moving through you inhale relaxation and exhale
any remaining tension in the body or mind
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I invite you now to draw your awareness
to the heart space and to invite your breath into it breathe slowly and
steadily here filling the heart
completely on each inhalation and
softening it on each exhalation
[Music]
come to notice the steadiness of the heart space it's slow flow and its
openness as you breathe you bring the
heart into greater harmony and equilibrium
[Music]
to slow down even more and to further this process of relaxation begin to add
counts of four to your breath on your
next inhalation breathe in to a slow count of four pause for a brief moment
at the top and then exhale for a full count of four take three full breath
cycles here following this guidance if
it feels comfortable to you
[Music]
envision the heart slowing in space [Music]
envision it relaxing completely into this moment it is beating naturally and
effortlessly without you needing to
intervene in any way simply by slowing
the breath the heart follows suit simply
by engaging in mindful breathing mind body and heart all come closer to
complete relaxation
[Music] as you settle into a sense of the heart
beating slowly and steadily start to
expand your field of awareness by imagining the pathways that flow into
and away from the heart
envision the life force that travels through your heart pumping smoothly and
effortlessly this life force your blood
nourishes your cells as it flows steadily through your body know that
without any effort without any force or
manipulation the body is nourishing itself in this very moment open your
heart a little bit further with each full breath knowing that you are being
supported by the body's innate wisdom right now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] continued to expand the breath
envisioning and traveling throughout the entire body where attention goes energy
flows
as you expand your awareness to encompass the entire physical body life
force in all its forms follow in that direction
[Music]
watching the breath flow steadily know that your blood is traveling in the same
manner effortlessly extensively and
wholeheartedly as you sink further into
stillness trusting the body's wisdom the
heart continues to beat slowly and steadily without any effort required on
your part there is nothing you need to
do and nothing you need to fix in this
very moment your body is in harmonious
flow [Music]
[Music]
begin to gently release everything held in the mind any visions thoughts or any
mental chatter that may have crept up release it all on your next exhalation
as you let go gently imagine the mind
dropping down to the heart space slowly
unfastening itself from the head space
passing through the space between your brows down the nose through mouth and
throat and landing softly in the heart
without creating any visions thoughts or feelings of what this looks like simply
hold your awareness in the heart and explore what it feels like to be in this
space continue to breathe deeply through
the heart [Music]
[Music] in a moment we will enter into a few
moments of silence you may choose to
retain your breath as your anchor and focus for these moments or if it suits
you you may introduce the following information on each inhalation as we
sing into silence you may quietly repeat yourself
I am flowing and on each exhalation you
may repeat I am releasing I am flowing
I am releasing I am flowing I am
releasing invite this affirmation into
your heart now or simply continue to breathe from the heart with your
awareness focused on your breath
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now gently release the affirmation if it
is currently passing through you with each breath and come back to the steady
rhythm of your heart exactly as it is [Music]
let go of all effort all focus and any
visions that may still be moving through you as you come quietly into pure
beingness
as you slowly drift into sleep there is
nothing you need to carry with you so
begin to shed any remaining thoughts now
simply practice for a few more moments
this art of pure being
you [Music]
you
let each part of the body soften as you
allow this physical space to support your journey into sleep
[Music]
allow the gentle flow of music to rock
you into a deep slumber
until you finally come to sleep for the night
[Music] continue to breathe deeply and slowly
allowing your breath to guide your hearts flow and to guide you into a
state of tranquility know that the
body's wisdom will continue to support and nourish you throughout the night and
that you were deeply supported by the energy flow that makes this life
possible
[Music] welcome to this powerful guided
meditation this mindfulness meditation and visualization will lead you with
compassion and curiosity deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation and
then into the past before eventually carrying you into a deep and peaceful
sleep I invite you to open your heart to this journey to whatever reveals itself
knowing that you are unconditionally supported in each and every moment that
passes allow the mind to rest aside as
we move backwards through time there is nothing you will need to actively search
for and nothing you'll need to find images and inner sensations may come for
you but you will not need to control them and epilate them or force them in
any way simply allow yourself to open up
entirely to whatever moves through you as we take this journey
allow this meditation in each moment to naturally reveal itself as you move
deeper and deeper into the past so
before we begin take a moment or two to come into a comfortable lying down
position and sure that you feel safe and secure wherever you are
ensure that your neck is aligned with the spine and your shoulders are relaxed
take a moment to consciously release all muscles as you sink further into this
supportive surface beneath you take a
few deep breaths here grounding yourself in this present moment use your breath
to guide you towards a place of complete stillness
[Music] although we will be moving through the expansive field of time you can always
ground yourself back into the present moment if you feel uncomfortable at any
point you are in complete control of this journey so if any images or
sensations arise that are too challenging for you to present Lee look at simply use your breath to anchor
yourself back into the present moment you are always always in control of your
journey with that said if any
challenging images arise or if the experience becomes heavy you are also in
an entirely safe domain to explore them images that arise in our consciousness
can never hurt us they are solely tools or teachers that hold the potential to
guide us forward in powerful and positive ways know that you are
universally supported in each and every moment now take a moment to come back to
your body notice your sense of touch through the
way the surfaces around you make contact with your physical body feel into the
textures that are present without moving noting how they feel as they rest
against your skin
consider the deeper levels of the physical body is it possible to become
mindful of the cellular world notice
your muscles and then invite them to relax encouraging them to sink further
into the surface beneath you now
consider the presence of air around your body and then gently follow it as it
moves within filling your lungs fully as
you take a breath in and returning to
the world around you on your exhale
allow the breath to become slow and steady just like the subtle lapping of
waves against the shoreline [Music]
take a few breaths on your own here following the innate rhythm of this life
force that supports you
[Music]
allow yourself to come into a state of relaxation by drawing your breath to the
heart space as you inhale allow your
heart to expand filling itself to the outer edges with peace joy and clarity
[Music] and as you exhale allow the walls of the
heart to soften releasing any tension that may be stored there
[Music]
continue to breathe this way for a few more rounds effortlessly quietening the
mind as you move closer and closer towards the true state of your heart
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] begin to notice a growing sense of peace
and tranquility as you become more attuned with the ever unfolding present
moment in just a few moments we will
begin our regression into the past allow your imagination to enrich your visions
as you move further and further into the mystical landscape we are about to enter
[Music] for just a few moments allow the space
before your third eye to empty completely
you may still see various colors and swirls of energy passing before you
there is no need to change or attempt to control this instead see if you can
simply observe whatever is present there just in front of your closed eyes you
don't have to judge it or attempt to change it in any way simply notice the
space that quietly and safely hold you in complete stillness in just a moment
you will sink as far into relaxation as is required for your personal present
moment and needs simply follow my voice as I count down guiding you deeper and
deeper into a state of all-encompassing peace and tranquility 10
you are feeling safe and secure embraced by this open space 9 all stress and
tension is being released with every breath you take 8 you are feeling heavy
nourished by the energy around you 7 you
are releasing even further 6 every
muscle is relaxed 5 you are completely
comfortable to let go for sinking
further and further 3
the mind is quiet unless you have come to relax completely
- you breathe slowly deeply and
effortlessly and one you have arrived
completely at peace completely relaxed
[Music] all is quiet or is at peace now
something starts to appear before your eyes out of the vast empty space before
you you notice a mist developing it is airy
and then chanted somehow beckoning you closer you take a few steps towards this
mist very slowly and mindfully and as
you approach it begins to dissipate as it slowly clears you begin to see there
is a bridge ahead of you covered in moss and vines you make your way towards it
mindfully treading on the pressed earth beneath your feet and as you cross over
everything you ever knew begins to disappear all thought all attachments
all fears and all worries
you are entering into a new world into a different time with every step you take
you inch closer towards the space and time just on the other side of the
bridge it is a place that feels familiar
somehow but one that your conscious mind cannot put any memory to the mist continues to
clear and you realize you are within a dense majestic forest you feel at home
you feel at peace here
he reached the other side of the bridge and with the mist having vanished completely now you take a closer look at
the scenery around you notice the colors and textures of this vibrant forest
consider the way the earth feels beneath your feet
you heighten your awareness of the aroma that awakens as you inhale deeply allow
this place to nurture the deep sense of peace that is within you you walk
forward ever so slightly as you noticed something peeking through from within
the trees and as you approach you
realize there is a cabin hidden within these woods and somehow you sense that
it is or was your own you instantly
remember it perhaps becoming flooded with visions of what it was once like in
your own time you reach the front door and enter
take a few moments to witness the visuals that are arising what does the
cabin look like what happened here once upon a time who
is with you imagery may come slowly and subtly
simply allow them to arise in their own time allow your imagination and
intuition to expand quite effortlessly
mindfully consider what was once here that no longer remains
[Music]
you
you
remain open to whatever arises there is no need to fear the past it no longer
has any control over you simply allow yourself to become the outside observer
of whatever you feel has happened here
watch this film play out as if you are a viewer rather than the character at
center stage [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
continue to breathe deeply as you simply observe whatever is present without
judgment to our condemnation
[Music]
[Music]
as we move through this time we shed old
ways of being in order to make room for more expansive ones mindfully begin to
consider what messages or lessons are being shared through these images that are arising what is there to be learned
what is there to shed
allow the mind to remain quiet as your
intuition arises tune in with your heart
opening yourself to the possibility of transformation
[Music]
return to your breath and to the aroma of the woods
take a few more moments to witness whatever once happened at this beautiful cabin in the forest
[Music] and slowly in your own time returned to
the bridge slowly crossing back over as you return
to the present physical reality you
passed through the mist once more making your way to the other side 10 you are
breathing deeply 9 you feel inspired and
uplifted by what you have learned 8 you
are calm and relaxed 7 your breath flows
as steady as gentle waves caressing the shore 6 the past fading now 5 you feel
deeply connected to the physical world for you exhale deeply letting everything
melt away [Music]
three you feel gratitude for the present reality you are in two
you know that you are whole and complete in this very moment one you have arrived
you are home once again you are at peace
[Music]
with the past now behind you you feel deeply settled within this present
moment you know that the past cannot be changed but that it provides opportunity
for growth and expansion everything you
witnessed now dissipates just as the mist did as you crossed over and into
the past you are still and silent and
for the moment nothing remains to be seen
you continue to allow positive and empowering lessons to reach you as you
transition into a sleeping state but you are not in search of anything you are
ready to rest easy for the entire night ahead dozing off swiftly and soundly
take a few more breaths mindfully inhaling peace contentment and freedom
and exhaling everything whatever once
was [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] the only place that truly exists is this
very moment everything that once was can
be used as a tool for self-realization at some future moment but for now allow
your breath to gently rock you to sleep
allow yourself to be nourished throughout the night ahead repeat the
following words to yourself in silence as you gently fall into a deep slumber I
am at home I am supported I am at peace
I am home I am supported
I am at peace I am home I am supported I
am at peace I sleep deeply and with ease
